<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Kelsie Schwartz’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I maintained my initial position favoring Option C, advocating for a full investment of 100% of our funds evenly distributed across the four quarters. I emphasized how this approach balances our growth ambitions with prudent risk management and adaptability in a stable market environment. The CEO, Finnley Bauer, responded positively to my points, affirming that my focus on stewardship and flexibility aligned strongly with the company’s values and strategic outlook. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, resulting in unanimous support for Option C during the voting phase. The final company decision was to adopt Option C, which was my preferred option from the outset, confirming that my perspective was well-aligned with the collective judgment of the board.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Finnley Bauer demonstrated strong leadership by articulating a clear, balanced rationale for Option C that resonated with all shareholders. His inclusive facilitation encouraged open dialogue without deviating from the predefined options, helping the team reach consensus efficiently. For example, he acknowledged and integrated insights from Miya Osborne and Eliana Ashley, reinforcing the importance of adaptability and learning. However, the CEO could improve by inviting more critical or alternative viewpoints early in the discussion to ensure the full range of risks and opportunities is explored before consensus builds. The company’s decision-making process worked effectively this meeting, with structured rounds that deepened understanding and built shared commitment. The unanimous adoption of Option C reflects a well-considered decision that is well-suited to the stable market conditions and the company’s desire to nurture both financial growth and a collaborative culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
I learned that our decision-making dynamics favor thorough, reflective dialogue combined with a strong emphasis on shared values such as stewardship, adaptability, and transparency. This approach fosters alignment and confidence in collective decisions. For future meetings, I might adjust my approach by encouraging even more explicit exploration of potential risks or dissenting views early on, to strengthen our robustness against unforeseen challenges. I noticed a pattern where consensus built steadily around the option that balanced financial prudence with cultural considerations, suggesting that framing arguments in those terms can be especially influential. Key takeaways for me include the importance of connecting financial strategy with team culture and the value of promoting ongoing reflection and adaptability. These insights will guide me to participate with greater intentionality, balancing my natural caution with openness to collective wisdom.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Kelsie Schwartz’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I firmly advocated for investing in Real Estate as the optimal asset for our first quarter investment. I highlighted its balanced risk-return profile, emphasizing how its steady appreciation and resilience align with our company’s values of responsible stewardship and adaptability in a stable market. Throughout the discussion, my position received strong affirmation from CEO Finnley Bauer, who echoed my reasoning and welcomed my emphasis on the tangible qualities of real estate that foster collective confidence and shared progress. Other shareholders expressed similar support, and no dissenting opinions challenged our consensus. The voting outcome was unanimous, with all six shareholders, including myself, approving the Real Estate proposal. This result matched my preferred option from the outset, confirming that our team’s collective judgment fully embraced the choice I championed.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Finnley Bauer demonstrated excellent leadership by clearly articulating the rationale behind selecting Real Estate, framing it as a harmonious blend of stability and growth suitable for our stable market environment. His facilitative style encouraged open, reflective dialogue and helped integrate diverse shareholder insights without losing focus on our predefined options. For example, he consistently acknowledged contributions from Eliana Ashley, Miya Osborne, Antonio Proctor, Harry Kirby, and myself, reinforcing a culture of respect and shared purpose. One area for improvement would be to further encourage early exploration of alternative viewpoints or potential risks, as the consensus solidified swiftly around Real Estate without extensive challenge; such exploration might deepen our understanding and prepare us better for unexpected market shifts. The company’s decision-making process this meeting was effective and inclusive, enabling a well-informed, unanimous decision. I believe the final decision to invest in Real Estate is sound and well-suited to both the current market conditions and our strategic goals, as it balances financial growth with cultural values, setting a strong foundation for future adaptability.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my understanding that our decision-making dynamic values thoughtful, collaborative dialogue closely tied to shared values like stewardship, adaptability, and tangible progress. I learned that presenting investment choices in terms that connect financial strategy to team culture can be especially persuasive. Going forward, I might adjust my approach by proactively inviting more critical questions or alternative views early in discussions to enrich our collective analysis and challenge assumptions more robustly. I noticed a clear pattern where consensus tends to build around options that simultaneously address financial prudence and cultural alignment, suggesting that framing future arguments with this dual focus will be influential. Key takeaways include the importance of grounding financial decisions in shared team purpose and the value of nurturing an adaptable mindset alongside steady progress. These insights will guide me to participate with greater intentionality and openness, balancing my natural preference for caution with receptiveness to collective wisdom and innovative perspectives.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Kelsie Schwartz’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently supported continuing our investment in Real Estate for Q2, reinforcing my belief that it offers the most balanced combination of steady growth, manageable risk, and positive cultural impact given the stable market conditions. I articulated how last quarter’s successful real estate investment not only delivered tangible financial returns but also nurtured a culture of trust, careful reflection, and adaptability within our team. The CEO, Finnley Bauer, responded affirmatively to my contributions, appreciating the emphasis on maintaining momentum while cautiously preparing for future opportunities, and he echoed my view that real estate remains the optimal choice for this quarter. Other shareholders similarly expressed unanimous support for real estate, with shared openness to exploring stocks as a future option once team confidence deepens. The voting outcome was unanimous (6/6), approving the real estate proposal. My preferred option was fully adopted, affirming alignment between my position and the collective decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Finnley Bauer demonstrated commendable leadership throughout the meeting by clearly framing the investment options within the context of both financial outcomes and company culture. He skillfully facilitated inclusive, reflective dialogue that encouraged shareholders to connect their financial reasoning with the company’s evolving values of stewardship, adaptability, and collaborative trust. For instance, his repeated acknowledgments of each shareholder’s input, including mine, fostered a respectful and thoughtful atmosphere. He could improve by actively soliciting more divergent viewpoints or potential risks earlier in the discussion to challenge consensus-building and guard against groupthink. The decision-making process was well-structured, progressing through thematic rounds that deepened shared understanding and culminated in a unanimous vote, demonstrating efficient consensus-building. I believe the final decision to invest in real estate was sound and well-suited to our current stable market environment, balancing steady financial progress with nurturing a resilient, adaptive company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my insight that our team values investment decisions that integrate financial prudence with cultural development, especially trust and collective adaptability. I learned that framing arguments in terms of how choices support both tangible returns and team dynamics helps build consensus effectively. In future meetings, I plan to more proactively encourage early exploration of dissenting views and potential risks to deepen our analysis and ensure robustness. I also noticed a recurring pattern: options that balance moderate risk with cultural alignment tend to gain stronger support, while higher-risk choices like stocks are embraced only as trust and confidence mature. A key takeaway for me is the importance of pacing risk-taking in harmony with team readiness, which aligns with my ISFP preference for cautious, value-driven decision-making. Moving forward, I will continue to blend my natural cautiousness with openness to evolving perspectives, aiming to contribute thoughtfully to both financial strategy and company culture as we grow together.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Finnley Bauer opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Finnley Bauer notices that real estate has provided a strong, steady return in the first period, followed by stability in the second, reflecting its reputation for reliability and manageable risk in a stable market. Cash and bonds have delivered consistent but modest gains, underscoring their safety but limited growth potential. Stocks, while offering the highest upside, have also shown significant volatility—highlighting both their creative potential and unpredictability, which may not align with our current need for steady progress and team confidence.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Kelsie Schwartz CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I feel most confident in real estate this quarter because it continues to offer a grounded, reliable path for steady growth without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. While the last quarter&#x27;s return was flat, the overall track record in this stable market environment reassures me that real estate aligns with our values of responsible stewardship and adaptability. Bonds are appealing for their consistency, but their lower return potential feels limiting for our growth goals. I’m not ready to support stocks yet, as the recent negative swing highlights risks that could disrupt our team’s sense of trust and progress. Cash remains a safe haven, but it doesn’t offer the meaningful momentum we need at this stage.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Finnley Bauer has set the theme: &#x27;Reflection on outcomes and lessons from previous real estate investments | Expected outcome: Identify key strengths, weaknesses, and team sentiment regarding our current investment approach&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Finnley Bauer My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I find myself drawn to real estate again this quarter as it continues to offer the kind of steady, tangible progress that feels grounding for both our company’s financial growth and our evolving culture. The stable market environment and our past positive experience with real estate reinforce my sense of trust in its reliability, even though last quarter’s return was flat. While I’m open to creative possibilities and acknowledge the potential of stocks for higher returns, their volatility doesn’t feel quite right for our team’s current need for confidence and cohesion. Bonds and cash, though safe, seem too limiting for the growth and learning we’re aiming for. Real estate still feels like the most harmonious choice for nurturing our momentum and supporting our shared values, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, I’d like us to reflect together on the outcomes and lessons from our previous real estate investments—specifically, to identify the key strengths, weaknesses, and team sentiment that have emerged from our current approach. By sharing honest reflections, we can deepen our collective understanding of how this strategy has supported or challenged our goals, and surface any important nuances that might inform our next step.</p><p>I encourage everyone to share candid insights, whether affirming or challenging our current path, so we can integrate diverse experiences into a more complete perspective. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I look forward to hearing your thoughtful contributions as we reflect and learn together.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Harry Kirby</h4></p><p><br>
Harry Kirby: &quot;I see our experience with real estate so far as a reflection of both our appetite for steady growth and our desire to build trust as a team. The first quarter’s strong return was encouraging, and even though last quarter was flat, I think the stability we gained is valuable—it keeps us grounded without closing off creative possibilities. For me, the main strength of real estate is how it matches our need for reliability and space to adapt, while the main weakness is that we might miss out on higher returns if we stick with it too long and don’t stay open to evolving as our confidence grows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Harry—I appreciate how you’ve articulated the value of stability and trust that real estate has brought us, as well as the subtle risk of becoming too comfortable and missing out on greater opportunities as our confidence develops. Your point about balancing reliability with openness to evolution really resonates with me, and I think it’s important for us to keep reflecting on when and how we might thoughtfully expand our risk appetite in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
Harry Kirby: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, Finnley. I think as our trust and shared experience deepen, we could consider experimenting with a small allocation to stocks in the future—not as a sudden shift, but as a signal that we’re ready to stretch a bit while still valuing what real estate has given us. If we keep this openness in mind, we can evolve our approach naturally, letting our confidence guide when it’s time to try something new.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Harry—I really value your insight on evolving our approach as our confidence and trust develop. While we do need to choose a single asset from our predefined options each quarter, your emphasis on remaining open to growth and creative risk-taking is important. Let’s continue to reflect on how our team’s readiness and shared experience might inform when it’s right to explore higher-return options like stocks, always keeping our decision grounded in what best serves our company’s development right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
Harry Kirby: &quot;I agree that our decision should be rooted in where we are as a team right now, not just in the numbers. Reflecting on our journey, I think the real value of our real estate investments has been building a culture where we can adapt and experiment together—so whether we stick with real estate or eventually try stocks, I believe our growing trust will help us navigate any choice with creativity and resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Kelsie Schwartz</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective on how our real estate investments have influenced both our financial stability and team culture, and I believe my reflections can help clarify the strengths and possible limitations of our current approach.</p><p><br>
Kelsie Schwartz: &quot;I appreciate the emphasis on stability and trust that real estate has brought us so far. From my perspective, one of the key strengths has been the way these investments have allowed us to build confidence as a team while maintaining steady progress—especially in a market where predictability is valuable. At the same time, I do wonder if the flat return last quarter signals a need to stay attentive to opportunities for growth, so we don’t become complacent or miss out on learning experiences that might come from thoughtfully exploring other options as our team evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Kelsie—your point about the value of steady progress and team confidence resonates with me, and I share your sense that we need to remain attentive to signs of stagnation. I agree that staying curious and open to thoughtfully exploring our other options is essential for continued growth, even as we honor the stability real estate has provided. Your perspective helps remind us to actively reflect on whether our current approach is still serving our evolving goals or if a shift could foster new learning and momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully acknowledges the balance between honoring stability and remaining open to growth, which aligns with my own evolving thinking. I can add value by emphasizing how our shared curiosity and willingness to reflect can help us recognize the right moment to adapt, building on both of our points to deepen the team’s understanding.</p><p><br>
Kelsie Schwartz: &quot;I appreciate your openness to ongoing reflection, Finnley. I think our collective willingness to question whether our current approach is still optimal is one of our greatest strengths—it keeps us adaptable and connected to our values. As we continue to learn together, staying curious and attentive will help us recognize when it’s time to evolve, ensuring our decisions remain both responsible and growth-oriented.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Kelsie—I completely agree that our willingness to question and reflect is a core strength that keeps us aligned with our values while supporting responsible growth. Your focus on curiosity and attentiveness is a helpful reminder that adaptability is essential for making decisions that serve both our immediate and long-term goals. Let’s continue to nurture this reflective mindset as we evaluate our options for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the importance of adaptability and reflection, and I believe I can add value by connecting this mindset to how we evaluate the specific options before us, helping the team stay grounded in both our values and the realities of the market.</p><p><br>
Kelsie Schwartz: &quot;I agree, and I think this reflective mindset will serve us well as we weigh the merits of real estate against the consistency of bonds and the potential of stocks. By staying grounded in our values while remaining open to new insights, we can make a choice that supports both our collective confidence and our long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Proctor</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Proctor: &quot;I see our real estate investments as having anchored us with a sense of steady progress and creative space, which has really helped build trust and a collaborative spirit within the team. At the same time, last quarter’s flat return is a reminder to stay open-minded and attentive so we don’t become too comfortable or miss out on learning from other options. I feel that real estate still aligns best with our values in this stable market, but I appreciate the encouragement to keep reflecting and adapting as our confidence grows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Antonio—I appreciate how you’ve captured the balance between the grounding benefits of real estate and the need to remain open to new learning as we move forward. Your point about avoiding complacency and continuing to reflect as our confidence grows is essential; it reminds us that our investment choices should evolve alongside our team’s development and aspirations. Let’s keep this spirit of creative attentiveness at the center of our decision-making as we move into the next phase of our discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Proctor: &quot;I agree, Finnley—keeping creative attentiveness at the center of our process gives us the flexibility to adapt when the time feels right, without losing the steady foundation we’ve built. As we consider our options, I think it’s important to keep asking not just which asset offers the best return, but which one best supports our evolving confidence and team culture in this moment. That way, we can be intentional about when and how we take on new risks, ensuring our choices always reflect both our goals and our growth as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Antonio—I think your emphasis on intentionally matching our investment choice to our evolving confidence and culture is an important reminder that financial outcomes are only part of the picture. Your perspective encourages us to keep our process both flexible and grounded, so our decisions reflect not only where we want to go financially but also how we want to grow as a team. This balance will be crucial as we assess our options and move toward a decision that truly supports our development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Proctor: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, Finnley. By staying mindful of how each investment decision shapes both our results and our team dynamic, we can use this quarter as a chance to strengthen the habits of reflection and adaptability that will serve us well down the line. Ultimately, I think the best choice is one that keeps us growing together, both financially and as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Eliana Ashley</h4></p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley: &quot;I’ve really valued how real estate has given us a sense of steady progress and space to build trust together—it’s helped us find our rhythm as a team without feeling boxed in. The flat return last quarter is a gentle nudge to stay curious and keep reflecting on when it might be right to stretch further, but I still feel real estate supports both our confidence and adaptability right now. I think our willingness to reflect openly and question ourselves is what keeps our approach vibrant and authentic, and real estate continues to feel like the best fit for where we are in this moment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Eliana—I appreciate how you’ve articulated the balance between steady progress and the need to stay curious about when it might be time to stretch further. Your emphasis on open reflection and questioning helps keep our strategy vibrant and authentic, ensuring we remain adaptable while honoring the trust and rhythm we’ve built as a team. Let’s continue to carry this spirit of self-inquiry as we move forward in our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley: &quot;I appreciate that, Finnley. For me, keeping this spirit of self-inquiry alive is what helps us avoid complacency and stay true to our values—real estate fits us now, but our openness to reflection means we’ll be ready to evolve when the time is right. This approach gives me confidence that whatever we decide, we’ll do it with both intention and authenticity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Eliana—I completely agree that keeping a spirit of self-inquiry at the heart of our process will help us remain intentional and authentic, no matter which option we choose.

I appreciate your confidence that this approach will guide us toward choices that reflect our values and aspirations.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley: &quot;I agree, Finnley—by keeping our process both grounded and open, we’re setting ourselves up to recognize new opportunities as soon as they genuinely align with our team’s confidence and goals. I think this approach not only supports our decision to stay with real estate for now, but also ensures we’ll be ready to pivot thoughtfully if the market or our team’s needs change.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Miya Osborne</h4></p><p><br>
Miya Osborne: &quot;I’ve found that our real estate investments have given us a strong sense of stability and grounded progress, which has been meaningful for building trust and collaboration within the team. At the same time, last quarter’s flat return is a gentle reminder to keep reflecting on whether our current approach continues to serve our goals—or if there are moments when opening ourselves to new possibilities might be valuable. For me, the key lesson is that our willingness to blend steady growth with ongoing self-inquiry is what keeps our strategy both resilient and responsive to change.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Miya—your emphasis on blending steady growth with ongoing self-inquiry really resonates with me. I agree that our willingness to continually reflect on whether our approach is serving our evolving goals is what keeps our strategy resilient and adaptable. Your perspective is a helpful reminder that staying open to new possibilities, even as we value stability, is key to ensuring our decisions remain aligned with both our goals and our team’s development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Miya Osborne: &quot;I appreciate that, Finnley. I think our ongoing reflection not only strengthens our current approach with real estate, but also prepares us to recognize when exploring other options—like stocks or bonds—might better support our growth. By staying attuned to both our results and our team’s development, we can ensure our choices remain intentional and well-aligned with our evolving goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Miya—your point about using ongoing reflection to strengthen our current approach while preparing us to recognize when other options might better serve our growth is very insightful. I agree that by staying closely connected to both our results and our team’s development, we can ensure our decisions remain intentional, responsive, and well-aligned with our evolving goals. This perspective will be essential as we move into our next round of analysis and consider how best to support both our financial progress and our team’s continued growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Miya Osborne: &quot;I agree, Finnley—maintaining this reflective approach gives us the flexibility to respond thoughtfully as our circumstances or confidence shift, whether that means continuing with real estate or considering stocks or bonds in the future. By prioritizing both intentionality and adaptability, we can make choices that truly reflect where we are as a team and where we want to go.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Finnley Bauer clearly favors investing in Real Estate this quarter, citing its steady, tangible progress and alignment with the company’s financial growth and evolving culture. He emphasizes the importance of stability and trust while acknowledging the potential of stocks for higher returns in the future, though he views their volatility as currently misaligned with the team’s need for confidence. His position reflects and integrates shareholder input, particularly the shared focus on balancing reliability with openness to growth and adaptability. Throughout the discussion, his stance remains consistent, showing a thoughtful openness to future exploration without shifting from his current preference for Real Estate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Kelsie Schwartz UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The consensus among shareholders about real estate’s role in fostering stability, steady progress, and team trust reinforced my confidence in this option. The CEO’s and other shareholders’ emphasis on ongoing self-inquiry and adaptability—especially in light of last quarter’s flat return—reminded me of the importance of staying alert to both growth opportunities and potential stagnation. While stocks were acknowledged for future potential as team confidence matures, the group’s shared caution about volatility and the limiting nature of bonds and cash kept my confidence distribution largely unchanged, with only a slight increase for bonds as a nod to their consistent returns.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my appreciation for the role of reflection and adaptability in our decision-making. I’m more aware of how our collective willingness to question and learn from each quarter’s outcomes strengthens both our financial strategy and team culture. My thinking has evolved to be slightly more open to bonds as a backup for stability, but I remain convinced that real estate best fits our current needs. The dialogue has reinforced my commitment to balancing steady growth with a readiness to adapt as our confidence and circumstances evolve.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the most harmonious balance of steady growth, manageable risk, and alignment with our company’s values in this stable market. The team’s consensus, paired with a shared commitment to ongoing reflection and adaptability, reassures me that this choice supports both our immediate goals and long-term development. While I’m attentive to the possibility of considering other options in the future, especially as our confidence grows, real estate remains the most responsible and supportive path for this quarter.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus around real estate as the most harmonious choice for this quarter, I believe that proceeding with our planned comparative risk-return analysis in a second round will add meaningful depth to our understanding. Shareholders have emphasized the importance of ongoing reflection, adaptability, and avoiding complacency—values that align with my own approach as CEO. By inviting a more analytical, side-by-side evaluation of all asset options in the current stable market, we can ensure that our decision is grounded in both thoughtful reflection and rigorous assessment. This additional round will provide an opportunity to surface any remaining uncertainties, validate our consensus, and strengthen our collective confidence in the final choice. I am committed to facilitating a process that is both thorough and inclusive, supporting our shared goal of making the most intentional and well-informed decision for the company’s development.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Finnley Bauer has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options in the present stable market | Expected outcome: Establish a clear, collective understanding of projected outcomes and vulnerabilities for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Finnley Bauer My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because real estate remains the most harmonious choice for our current context, offering steady, tangible progress and a solid foundation for team trust and collaboration. The consensus among shareholders affirms its alignment with our values and the stable market environment. While there is a collective awareness of the need to stay open to new opportunities and avoid complacency, the group agrees that real estate still best supports our evolving confidence and growth at this stage. I will continue to encourage ongoing reflection to ensure we remain responsive to future shifts in team sentiment or market conditions, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, our theme is a comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options in the present stable market. Our goal is to establish a clear, collective understanding of the projected outcomes and vulnerabilities for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks this quarter.</p><p>By engaging in this side-by-side evaluation, we can synthesize diverse perspectives and deepen our shared insight into how each asset aligns with our current needs and risk tolerance. I encourage everyone to contribute thoughtfully, as integrating different viewpoints will help us make a more informed and resilient decision.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I invite you to share perspectives—especially those that might challenge or enhance our current thinking—so we can collectively refine our understanding and make the best possible choice for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Kelsie Schwartz</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a perspective on how each asset’s risk-return profile fits with our values and current needs, and I believe highlighting these distinctions will help clarify the trade-offs for the team.</p><p><br>
Kelsie Schwartz: &quot;I see real estate as continuing to offer the most balanced path for us—its steady, tangible returns align with our desire for responsible growth and support the trust we’ve built as a team. Bonds are appealing for their consistency and low risk, but their lower returns feel limiting at this stage, while cash, though safest, doesn’t provide enough momentum for our development. Stocks certainly have the highest upside, but the recent volatility reminds me that we’re not quite ready to take on that level of risk without potentially disrupting our sense of progress and stability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Kelsie. I appreciate how you’ve clearly articulated the unique strengths and trade-offs of each option, especially in connecting real estate’s steady returns to both our growth goals and the trust we’ve built as a team. Your reflection on the limitations of bonds and cash, as well as the timing concerns around stocks, helps clarify why real estate continues to feel like the most balanced and supportive choice for us in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the alignment between real estate and our current priorities, but I believe I can add nuance by acknowledging the value in periodically reassessing our risk tolerance and highlighting how ongoing dialogue prepares us for future shifts—especially as stocks may become more relevant over time.</p><p><br>
Kelsie Schwartz: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on balancing stability with openness to future opportunities. I think our ongoing dialogue about risk and return not only strengthens our decision for this quarter but also keeps us adaptable if market conditions or our team’s confidence shift. Staying engaged with these comparative analyses ensures we’re prepared to thoughtfully consider options like stocks when the timing feels right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Kelsie. I agree that maintaining this kind of ongoing dialogue helps keep us both grounded in our current strengths and ready to thoughtfully consider alternatives as our confidence and the market evolve. Your point about staying engaged with these analyses is a valuable reminder that our process itself is a key part of building resilience and adaptability for the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response fully acknowledges and integrates my points, and I believe further comments would not add meaningful nuance at this stage.</p><p><br>
Kelsie Schwartz chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Proctor</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Proctor: &quot;I see real estate as still offering the most harmonious balance for us right now—its steady, medium returns nurture our team’s confidence while giving us space to grow creatively and adapt as needed. Bonds and cash feel too limiting for our ambitions at this stage, since their safety comes at the cost of meaningful progress, and stocks, while tempting for their upside, seem too volatile for where our trust and momentum are currently. I think our ongoing openness to reviewing these options each quarter will help us stay both resilient and ready for new opportunities as our team evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Antonio. Your emphasis on nurturing confidence while leaving space for creative growth and adaptation really resonates with me. I agree that maintaining openness and regularly reviewing all our options helps ensure our decisions remain both resilient and well-aligned with our evolving ambitions—your perspective adds valuable depth to our risk-return analysis this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Proctor: &quot;I appreciate that, Finnley. I’d add that our regular risk-return analysis isn’t just about protecting our assets—it’s also a way to keep our team engaged in creative problem-solving and learning from each cycle. That spirit of curiosity and reflection is what will help us spot the right moment to evolve our strategy together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Antonio. I completely agree that our approach to risk-return analysis is about much more than just safeguarding our assets—it’s an active way to keep our team engaged, reflective, and ready to adapt. Your point about curiosity and learning cycles really underscores how our decision-making process can strengthen both our strategy and our culture, helping us recognize when it’s time to thoughtfully evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Proctor chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Eliana Ashley</h4></p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley: &quot;From my perspective, real estate continues to strike the best balance for us—it offers steady, meaningful growth that keeps our team grounded and confident, without closing the door to creative opportunities in the future. While stocks are always tempting for their upside, the recent volatility feels out of sync with the trust and momentum we’ve built so far. Bonds and cash might be safe, but they just don’t give us enough space to grow or adapt in a way that feels authentic for where we are as a company right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Eliana. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted real estate’s role in keeping us grounded and confident while still leaving room for creative opportunities ahead. Your reflections on the limitations of stocks, bonds, and cash in relation to our current trust and momentum help clarify why real estate feels most authentic to where we are as a team right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley: &quot;I think what’s really powerful about our process is that we’re not just picking the “safe” option—we’re choosing real estate because it genuinely fits our current strengths and aspirations, while our regular risk-return reviews make sure we’re never stuck in one mindset. This ongoing reflection keeps us nimble and ready to pivot when the timing and team confidence are right, which I see as a huge asset for our growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Eliana. I agree that our commitment to regular risk-return reviews is what truly sets our process apart—it ensures we’re not just defaulting to safety, but making intentional choices that reflect our strengths and evolving goals. Your point about staying nimble and open to change highlights how our reflective approach keeps us well-positioned to seize new opportunities when our confidence and the market align.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley: &quot;I appreciate that, Finnley. I think by consciously weighing the trade-offs of cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks each quarter, we’re not only protecting our progress but also strengthening our ability to adapt with purpose. This kind of intentional review keeps our strategy vibrant and ensures we’re always ready to align our choices with both market realities and our evolving team spirit.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Eliana. I completely agree that by intentionally weighing the trade-offs of all our options each quarter, we’re building both resilience and adaptability into our strategy. Your point about keeping our process vibrant and purpose-driven really resonates with me—it ensures we’re always making choices that reflect both the realities of the market and the evolving spirit of our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eliana Ashley chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Miya Osborne</h4></p><p><br>
Miya Osborne: &quot;I appreciate how our discussion has highlighted the unique roles each asset can play in a stable market. For me, real estate still stands out because it offers steady, tangible progress that supports both our financial goals and the trust we’ve built as a team, while stocks—despite their upside—introduce a level of unpredictability that doesn’t quite fit our current need for stability. Bonds and cash certainly provide safety, but their limited returns feel out of step with our desire for meaningful advancement and ongoing learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Miya. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the distinct roles each asset class plays in a stable market and the importance of aligning our choice with both financial goals and team trust. Your point about real estate offering steady progress while stocks’ unpredictability feels mismatched for our current needs really helps clarify why real estate continues to stand out for us this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Miya Osborne: &quot;I agree that aligning our investment with both our financial goals and team trust is essential. As our confidence and experience grow, I can see us thoughtfully revisiting options like stocks or even bonds, especially if our collective appetite for risk evolves. For now, I think staying grounded in real estate’s steady progress gives us the space to keep building that foundation, while our ongoing dialogue ensures we’re always ready to adapt when the time feels right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Miya. I appreciate your emphasis on balancing steady progress with the flexibility to adapt as our confidence and experience grow. Your point about keeping real estate as our foundation while remaining open to thoughtfully revisiting stocks or bonds in the future captures exactly the kind of intentional, reflective approach that strengthens both our strategy and team culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
Miya Osborne: &quot;I appreciate that, Finnley. I think our commitment to intentional, reflective decision-making is what truly allows us to respond thoughtfully to change—whether that means continuing with real estate or embracing new opportunities when they genuinely fit our evolving goals. This ongoing process of self-inquiry and open dialogue is, in itself, a key part of our resilience as a company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Harry Kirby</h4></p><p><br>
Harry Kirby: &quot;I see real estate as continuing to offer the best balance for us in this environment—it provides steady, medium returns that nurture our growth and trust as a team, without boxing us in creatively. Cash and bonds are safe but feel too limiting for where we are, while stocks, despite their upside, seem a bit too volatile for our current appetite. I think our ongoing openness to reevaluate each quarter is key, but for now, real estate feels like the option that best supports both our progress and our adventurous, adaptable spirit.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Harry. I appreciate how you’ve articulated the balance real estate provides between steady growth and creative flexibility, which really resonates with our current needs as a team. Your point about the importance of remaining open to reevaluating our choices each quarter is a valuable reminder that our adaptability is just as crucial as our initial decision, helping us stay aligned with both our progress and our evolving spirit.&quot;</p><p><br>
Harry Kirby: &quot;I appreciate that, Finnley. I think what’s exciting is that by building confidence through steady choices like real estate now, we’re actually expanding our capacity to take creative risks later when the timing feels right. This approach keeps our momentum strong but also leaves the door open for bolder moves as our trust and experience grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Finnley Bauer: &quot;Thank you, Harry. I completely agree that building confidence through steady, thoughtful decisions now creates a strong foundation for us to take bolder, more creative steps when the time is right. Your point about keeping our momentum while leaving space for future growth really highlights how our current approach supports both immediate progress and long-term adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Kelsie Schwartz, I argued that real estate remains the most balanced investment option, offering steady returns that align with our values of responsible growth and team trust, while cautioning against the limitations of bonds and cash and the volatility risks of stocks at this stage. CEO Finnley Bauer responded by affirming my clear articulation of each asset’s trade-offs and the importance of grounding our choice in both financial goals and cultural cohesion. We agreed on maintaining ongoing dialogue to stay adaptable and prepared for future shifts, with the CEO appreciating my emphasis on reflective decision-making as key to resilience. There were no disagreements; rather, our exchange reinforced a shared commitment to steady progress combined with openness to thoughtful evolution as team confidence and market conditions evolve.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During round 2, other shareholders uniformly supported real estate as the preferred investment, emphasizing its steady growth, manageable risk, and alignment with the company’s current culture and stable market environment. Harry Kirby highlighted real estate’s balance between steady returns and creative flexibility, while Antonio Proctor stressed its role in nurturing confidence and allowing space for creative growth. Eliana Ashley underscored real estate’s authenticity to the company’s strengths and aspirations, noting that regular risk-return reviews keep the team nimble. Miya Osborne pointed out real estate’s support for financial goals and team trust, cautioning that stocks’ volatility makes them less suitable now but potentially viable in the future. There were no significant disagreements; all agreed that cash and bonds, while safe, are too limiting for current growth ambitions, and stocks, despite high upside, are too volatile for the present stage, with openness to reconsidering them as confidence and experience develop.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The repeated emphasis from both the CEO and fellow shareholders on real estate’s steady, meaningful growth and its role in supporting team trust and adaptability reinforced my confidence in this option. The group’s mature analysis of risk-return trade-offs, especially the consensus that bonds and cash are too limiting for our current growth ambitions, further solidified my preference.

I became more attuned to the value of ongoing dialogue and regular risk-return reviews, which help us avoid complacency and remain adaptable.

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Rosie Trujillo’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting – Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In today’s meeting, I decisively advocated for Option C, which involves allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was fueled by my excitement to fully engage our capital in a stable market environment and my belief that this approach balances boldness with adaptability. When I spoke, CEO Anaya Cooke responded warmly, appreciating my enthusiasm and openness to hearing any residual concerns about risks. She echoed my sentiments on the importance of making a well-informed, collective decision. Other shareholders also expressed strong support for Option C, reinforcing the momentum around this option. Ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C, confirming that my preferred choice was adopted as the company’s official budget allocation strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Anaya Cooke demonstrated excellent leadership by effectively setting a clear theme for the meeting and encouraging open but focused dialogue. Her framing of Option C as both adventurous and responsible resonated deeply with the team and kept the discussion energized and optimistic. A specific example of her strength was her consistent invitations for shareholders to voice any concerns or alternative views, which fostered a culture of transparency and thoroughness—even though no objections emerged. However, one area for improvement could be her choice to remain silent when some shareholders, including myself, explicitly called for risk-related input from others; a more active facilitation at these moments might have prompted deeper critical reflection. Overall, the company’s decision-making process this meeting was highly collaborative and efficient, culminating in a unanimous vote that balanced ambition with caution. I believe the final decision to adopt Option C is excellent for the company, setting an energetic and adaptable tone that fits the stable market conditions and our first-year goals.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced for me how powerful collective enthusiasm and shared confidence are in driving decisions, especially when aligned with clear, positive leadership. I learned that openly inviting dissent—even when none arises—strengthens the team’s trust and confirms the robustness of our choices. In future meetings, I plan to continue voicing my support early to help build momentum but will also be more proactive in soliciting and addressing any underlying concerns or alternative perspectives to ensure comprehensive evaluation. I noticed a pattern where the CEO’s framing heavily influences the group’s leaning, so understanding her perspective early could help predict outcomes and tailor my contributions accordingly. My key takeaway is that maintaining a balance between excitement and responsibility, while nurturing open communication, is essential for effective decision-making and team cohesion. I will carry this insight forward to keep our company’s culture vibrant and inclusive as we tackle future challenges together.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Anaya Cooke opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Rosie Trujillo CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I feel energized by the idea of starting our company’s journey with a bold move, especially since the market is stable and predictable right now. Stocks offer the most excitement and potential for strong returns, and I’m drawn to the possibility of making a real impact right from the start. While I recognize there’s some risk, the steady market makes me confident that the volatility won’t be overwhelming, and I love the idea of keeping things dynamic and engaging for the team. Real estate is also appealing for its steady growth, but stocks just feel like the right way to channel our collective momentum and optimism this quarter.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Anaya Cooke has set the theme: &#x27;Evaluating theoretical risk-return profiles for each asset in a stable market | Expected outcome: Establish a shared baseline understanding of how cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks are expected to perform under current conditions&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Anaya Cooke My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m feeling energized by the steady, predictable market and want to seize the opportunity to set a bold, optimistic tone in our very first quarter. Stocks offer the highest potential for growth, and with low volatility right now, the risks feel manageable—especially since we can adapt quickly if conditions change. I love the idea of starting strong and showing our team that we’re not afraid to go after big wins when the environment supports it. While real estate is also appealing for its steady appreciation, I’m drawn to the excitement and momentum that stocks can bring to our portfolio right out of the gate. If compelling arguments arise, I’m open to adjusting, but for now, I believe stocks are the best way to kick off our investment journey, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, we’ll focus on evaluating the theoretical risk-return profiles for each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in the context of our stable market, aiming to establish a shared baseline understanding of how each is likely to perform. By pooling our perspectives, we can clarify where each option stands in terms of safety, growth, and volatility, and set a strong foundation for future decisions. Let’s use this opportunity to challenge assumptions, highlight overlooked factors, and build a more complete picture together. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any insights or considerations—especially those I may not have fully weighed—to help us deepen our collective understanding before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Luna Holmes</h4></p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;I appreciate the enthusiasm for stocks, especially with the market so steady right now, but I keep coming back to real estate as a great fit for our first move. In a stable environment, real estate tends to deliver consistent growth with less volatility than stocks, giving us something solid to rally around while still letting us aim for meaningful returns. Plus, there’s something motivating about making our mark with a visible asset that the whole team can get excited about right from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Luna, I really appreciate you surfacing the motivational aspect of real estate and how its stability could give us a strong, visible foundation to rally around. Your point about lower volatility in a stable market is well taken—it’s a good reminder that meaningful returns don’t always have to come with higher risk, and that building excitement can also come from making a tangible mark early on. This adds an important dimension to our baseline understanding, and I’m interested to hear if others see real estate’s consistency as the right fit for our launch, or if the potential upside of stocks still outweighs that for them.&quot;</p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted the value of building excitement and team unity, Anaya. For me, starting with real estate isn’t just about steady returns—it’s about giving everyone something tangible to celebrate and rally behind, which I think could set a really positive tone for our company culture. I’m curious if others feel that having a visible, shared asset might help us stay motivated and connected as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Luna, thank you for expanding on the cultural impact—a visible, shared asset truly can help foster a sense of unity and pride, especially as we’re just starting out. I agree that celebrating early, tangible wins could energize our team and reinforce our shared identity, which is a powerful motivator. I’d love to hear from others whether this aspect tips the scale for them, or if the excitement and growth potential of stocks still feels more compelling in this context.&quot;</p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;I think you’re absolutely right, Anaya—the chance to rally around a real, shared investment could really anchor our momentum as a new team. While the excitement of stocks is tempting, I feel like real estate’s combination of steady returns and tangible progress is exactly what we need to build early confidence and keep everyone engaged. I’m eager to hear if others feel that sense of shared accomplishment could be a difference-maker as we shape our company’s identity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Luna, I completely see where you’re coming from—having a real, tangible asset to celebrate could absolutely help anchor our team’s identity and build momentum. I think this is a great reminder that our investment isn’t just about numbers, but also about the story we tell ourselves as a company. I’d love to open the floor to others now—does anyone else feel that the shared accomplishment of real estate could be a difference-maker, or do you see more value in the energy and growth potential of stocks for our first quarter?&quot;</p><p><br>
Luna Holmes chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Maximillian Wise</h4></p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I’m really energized by the idea of starting with real estate, especially since it gives us that sweet spot of steady growth and something concrete to rally around as a team. In a stable market, I see real estate as offering enough excitement to keep things lively without exposing us to the bigger swings of stocks, which feels like a smart way to build momentum and confidence right out of the gate. I love the CEO’s point about setting a bold tone, but I think real estate lets us be bold and grounded at the same time—giving us both early wins and a strong foundation to build our story on.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Maximillian, I really appreciate how you’ve captured the idea of being both bold and grounded—real estate does seem to offer that unique balance of steady growth and tangible momentum, especially in a stable market. Your point about building early confidence and a strong foundation resonates with me, and it’s helpful to see how real estate could deliver excitement without the bigger swings of stocks. I’d like to hear from others—do you see this “bold and grounded” approach as the right fit for our first move, or does the higher growth potential of stocks still hold more appeal for you?&quot;</p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I really appreciate how you’re weighing both the excitement of stocks and the grounding effect of real estate, Anaya. For me, the chance to celebrate early, visible progress is a huge motivator—especially when we’re building our company culture from scratch. Real estate feels like the best way to channel our team’s energy into something lasting, while still keeping us agile and ready to seize new opportunities as the year unfolds.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Maximillian, I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the importance of early, visible progress for building our culture and momentum. Your point about real estate providing both a lasting foundation and the flexibility to stay agile really helps round out our understanding of how this asset might serve us in a stable market. I’d love to hear if others feel this “visible progress” is the edge we need, or if the dynamic energy of stocks is still more compelling for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I think it’s worth emphasizing that in a stable market, the confidence we build from seeing real, tangible progress early on could make us more willing to take smart risks later in the year. Real estate gives us something to point to as a team win, which can really amplify our momentum and make everyone feel invested—literally and emotionally—in our journey together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Maximillian, your point about building confidence through early, visible progress is spot on—it’s exciting to think how a real estate win could set us up to take bolder, well-calculated risks as the year unfolds. I appreciate how you’ve connected our first investment to the momentum and risk appetite we’ll have down the line. Let’s hear from others: do you see this early team win as a springboard for greater ambition later, or does the growth potential of stocks still feel like the stronger play for our launch?&quot;</p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I really appreciate the focus on how our first investment shapes our mindset for the rest of the year. By choosing real estate now, we not only build confidence but also create a track record that makes it easier for us to embrace higher-return options like stocks in future quarters. This step-by-step momentum feels like the smartest way to balance ambition with sustainable growth as we launch our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Maximillian, I really like how you’ve framed our first investment as a catalyst for future ambition—building a solid track record with real estate now could indeed make it easier for us to pursue higher-return options like stocks later on. Your emphasis on step-by-step momentum as a bridge between ambition and sustainable growth is a compelling way to think about our launch. I’d love to hear from the rest of the team—does this approach to building confidence and strategic flexibility resonate, or do you see more value in making a bold play for growth with stocks right away?&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Rosie Trujillo</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute, especially around the energy and team engagement that comes from making a bold first move, and I want to build on the valuable points about visible progress and team motivation already raised by Luna and Maximillian.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo: &quot;I love the focus on building team momentum and the idea of celebrating a visible win together—real estate definitely has that appeal in a stable market. At the same time, I’m still drawn to stocks because they offer the thrill of higher returns and keep things dynamic, which could really energize us right from the start. I think both options set a positive tone, but for me, starting with stocks feels like the best way to channel our optimism and make a strong, exciting statement as we launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Rosie, I appreciate how you’ve captured the core tension between building steady, visible momentum with real estate and embracing the dynamic, high-energy potential of stocks. Your point about channeling optimism into a bold statement with stocks really resonates with me, especially as we look to set the tone for our company’s launch. I’d love to hear if others see stocks as the best way to energize our team from day one, or if the tangible progress of real estate still holds more appeal for this first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the central tradeoff between visible progress and bold energy, inviting further synthesis. I can help clarify how the excitement of stocks might also translate into team engagement, complementing the earlier points about real estate’s motivational impact.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve framed this as a core tension, Anaya. While real estate’s visibility is motivating, I think the shared excitement of aiming high with stocks could be just as unifying—there’s something about taking a bold step together that can spark energy and pride in the team. For me, the thrill of going after strong returns right away could help set a dynamic, optimistic tone that keeps everyone engaged and inspired as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Rosie, I really value how you’ve highlighted the unifying power of bold ambition—there’s definitely something special about a team choosing to aim high together, which can generate real pride and motivation. Your point about setting a dynamic, optimistic tone with stocks is a great reminder that excitement itself can be a catalyst for engagement, not just steady progress. I’d love to hear if others feel that this collective leap could be the spark we need, or if the steady momentum of real estate still feels like the stronger foundation for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly engages with my point about ambition and team energy, and I see an opportunity to further integrate the idea that both excitement and visible progress can drive engagement—helping the team weigh how each asset might uniquely inspire us.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo: &quot;I think it’s important to recognize that both options—stocks and real estate—have the power to unify and motivate us, just in different ways. If we’re intentional about celebrating our boldness and keeping communication open, starting with stocks could create a shared sense of adventure that bonds the team just as much as a tangible asset would. Ultimately, it’s about how we channel that energy and keep everyone feeling involved and excited, whichever path we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Rosie, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated that both stocks and real estate can unify and energize our team, depending on how we approach and celebrate the journey together. Your point about intentionally channeling our energy and keeping communication open is key—it reminds us that our team’s spirit will be shaped as much by our mindset and collaboration as by the asset itself. I’d love to hear from others whether this perspective shifts how they’re thinking about the tradeoff, or if one option still stands out as the best fit for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I feel I’ve fully contributed my perspective by highlighting how both stocks and real estate can unify and motivate our team, and the CEO has acknowledged and synthesized this point for the group. At this stage, further input from me would likely be repetitive rather than additive.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

In a stable market like ours, real estate feels like the perfect “happy medium”—it offers enough excitement to keep us motivated but with less risk than stocks, and having a visible asset to celebrate could really boost our team spirit. While I see the thrill that comes with stocks, I think real estate gives us a strong, steady foundation to build momentum and confidence together, especially as we kick things off.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Gabrielle, I appreciate how you’ve framed real estate as the perfect balance between excitement and stability—it’s a great reminder that we don’t have to choose between motivation and risk management. Your point about building momentum and confidence with a visible, steady asset really adds depth to our discussion, and I’d love to hear if others agree that this “happy medium” is the best fit for our launch, or if the higher-growth potential of stocks still holds more appeal for them.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gabrielle Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your focus on balancing motivation and risk management, Anaya. I think starting with real estate lets us build early momentum and confidence, which could make the team more comfortable taking on higher-return opportunities—like stocks—later in the year. By establishing a strong, visible foundation now, we set ourselves up to be both bold and adaptable as market conditions evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Gabrielle, I really like how you’ve connected our first investment to setting ourselves up for even bolder opportunities down the road. Your point about building early momentum and confidence with real estate so we’re ready to embrace higher-return options later really strengthens our baseline understanding of how each asset can serve our long-term strategy. I’d love to hear if others see this stepwise approach as the best way to balance ambition and adaptability, or if a direct leap into stocks still feels like the right move for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gabrielle Johnson: &quot;I think this stepwise approach is a great way to keep our momentum high while still leaving room for bigger moves later. By starting with real estate, we’re not closing the door on ambition—we’re actually building the confidence and track record we’ll need to go after those high-return options like stocks when the timing feels right. This way, we get the best of both worlds: steady progress now and the flexibility to be bold when we’re ready.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Gabrielle, I really appreciate how you’ve outlined the benefits of a stepwise approach—building steady progress and confidence with real estate now while keeping our options open for bigger, bolder moves later. Your point about not closing the door on ambition but actually setting ourselves up for it is a great way to think about balancing risk and reward as we launch. I’d love to hear if others feel this steady progression is the best way to channel our optimism, or if making a bold leap with stocks still feels more inspiring for our first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gabrielle Johnson: &quot;I love how this conversation is surfacing the idea that ambition doesn’t have to mean rushing into the riskiest option right away. Real estate gives us something real to celebrate now, fueling our optimism, while also making sure we’re strong and ready for those bolder leaps—like stocks—when we’ve built up more confidence as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Gabrielle, I love how you’ve reframed ambition as a journey—real estate really can give us something tangible to celebrate now, while still building the confidence and strength we’ll need for those bigger leaps later. Your point that we don’t have to rush into the riskiest option to be ambitious is a great reminder that steady progress can be just as energizing and strategic. I’d like to open the floor to the rest of the team—does this approach to fueling optimism and readiness resonate, or do you still see more value in leading with the high-growth potential of stocks for our first quarter?&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Huw Dalton</h4></p><p><br>
Huw Dalton: &quot;I’m really appreciating the focus on team unity and building confidence with real estate, but I keep coming back to the unique energy that stocks can bring in a stable market like this. With volatility low, the risk feels manageable, and I think there’s something incredibly motivating about aiming high together and seeing how our boldness pays off. I believe starting with stocks could set an exciting tone for our company—one that keeps us engaged, adaptable, and ready to celebrate big wins as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Huw, I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted the motivating power of aiming high together, especially when the market’s stability keeps risks in check. Your point about the unique energy and excitement stocks can generate is a great reminder that boldness can be a powerful unifier for our team, not just a risk factor. I’d love to hear if others feel that starting with stocks is the best way to channel our optimism and set an ambitious tone, or if the steady foundation of real estate still feels like the right fit for our first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Huw Dalton: &quot;I think it’s important to recognize that both options—stocks and real estate—can set a powerful tone for our team, just in different ways. The excitement of aiming high with stocks can be just as unifying as celebrating visible progress with real estate, especially if we’re intentional about rallying around our shared ambition and keeping communication open. For me, the key is how we channel that energy—starting with stocks could inspire a sense of adventure and pride, while still keeping us adaptable and engaged as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Huw, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated that both stocks and real estate can set a powerful, unifying tone—it’s all about how we rally around our shared ambition and keep communication open. Your point that the sense of adventure and pride can come from either bold moves or visible progress is a great reminder that our team culture is shaped by intention as much as by the asset itself. I’d love to hear if others feel this perspective shifts their thinking about which option best fits our launch, or if one still stands out as the clear choice for energizing our team from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>
Huw Dalton: &quot;I really agree that our team’s success will come down to how we approach this together—whether we choose stocks or real estate, our intention to support each other and stay adaptable will make the biggest impact. If we keep communication open and celebrate both bold moves and steady progress, I’m confident we can build the kind of culture that thrives no matter which path we take. This mindset gives me even more confidence that we’ll make the most out of whichever option we choose for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, Rosie Trujillo argued in favor of investing in stocks, emphasizing their high growth potential and the energizing effect a bold move could have on team momentum and optimism. CEO Anaya Cooke acknowledged Rosie’s points, appreciating her framing of stocks as a way to channel optimism and set an ambitious tone for the company’s launch. They agreed that both stocks and real estate could unify and motivate the team, albeit through different mechanisms—stocks via excitement and boldness, and real estate via tangible progress and stability. The CEO encouraged further input from others to weigh these perspectives, and Rosie contributed by highlighting how the excitement of stocks could foster a shared sense of adventure and pride alongside the motivational impact of real estate. Ultimately, the CEO synthesized Rosie’s views, recognizing the importance of intentionally channeling energy and communication to shape team spirit regardless of the asset chosen.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Luna Holmes, Maximillian Wise, and Gabrielle Johnson consistently supported investing in real estate, emphasizing its steady growth, lower volatility compared to stocks, and the motivational value of having a tangible, visible asset to rally the team around. They argued that real estate builds early confidence and momentum, serving as a solid foundation for future, bolder investments. Meanwhile, Huw Dalton aligned with the stock proponents, highlighting the energizing effect of aiming high with stocks in a stable market and the unifying power of shared ambition. Across shareholders, there was consensus that both stocks and real estate offer unique benefits for team motivation and growth, though disagreement remained on whether to prioritize bold energy (stocks) or steady, visible progress (real estate) for the first quarter. Cash and bonds were generally seen as less suitable options given the stable market conditions.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Anaya Cooke: Supports stocks as the best initial investment for their high growth potential and ability to set a bold, optimistic tone; confidence: certain.<br>
- Luna Holmes: Supports real estate for steady growth, lower volatility, and its motivational value as a visible, tangible asset; confidence: certain.<br>
- Maximillian Wise: Supports real estate emphasizing its balance of boldness and groundedness, early visible progress, and momentum-building; confidence: certain.<br>
- Gabrielle Johnson: Supports real estate as a “happy medium” offering excitement with less risk and a foundation for future bold moves; confidence: certain.<br>
- Huw Dalton: Supports stocks for their energizing effect, manageable risk in a stable market, and unifying power through shared ambition; confidence: certain.<br>
- Rosie Trujillo (self): Supports stocks for higher returns and dynamic team engagement but acknowledges real estate’s motivational appeal; confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke clearly favors investing in stocks for the first quarter, citing their highest potential for growth in the current stable and low-volatility market. She argues that stocks can set a bold, optimistic tone and energize the team with shared excitement and ambition. While she acknowledges the appeal of real estate’s steady appreciation and motivational value, her position remains consistent throughout the discussion, emphasizing adaptability and the ability to adjust if conditions change. The CEO actively integrates shareholder input by recognizing the merits of both stocks and real estate but ultimately maintains her initial preference for stocks as the best way to launch the company’s investment journey.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Rosie Trujillo UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 42%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The repeated emphasis by Luna, Maximillian, and Gabrielle on real estate’s ability to deliver steady growth, lower volatility, and create a visible, unifying milestone for the team was compelling. I was also influenced by Maximillian’s point that building early confidence with a tangible win could set us up for bolder moves later. However, the CEO’s and Huw’s arguments about the energizing, ambitious tone stocks could set—especially given the stable, low-volatility market—kept my confidence in stocks high. My own exchanges clarified that both options can unify and motivate the team, depending on how intentionally we approach them.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I became more aware of how much I value both excitement and visible progress for team motivation. The strong, thoughtful arguments for real estate made me appreciate its potential to build early momentum and confidence, even as I remain drawn to the thrill and boldness of stocks. I now see the decision as less about right versus wrong and more about which kind of energy we want to lead with. My thinking has evolved to more fully respect the cultural and emotional impacts of each option, not just their financial profiles.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I still prefer stocks because I believe starting with a bold, high-energy move in a stable market can spark excitement and unify the team around shared ambition. The manageable risk right now makes this a unique opportunity to aim high together and set a dynamic tone for our company. That said, I have a renewed appreciation for real estate’s steady, confidence-building qualities and how it could also motivate us—so my confidence in that option has grown as well. Ultimately, I think stocks best match my desire to channel our optimism into strong, immediate momentum.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While our first round has surfaced strong, well-articulated arguments for both stocks and real estate, I believe another round focused on explicitly assessing our collective risk appetite and how it aligns with our team values will be valuable for bridging the remaining divide. Several shareholders have expressed nuanced perspectives on motivation, ambition, and team culture, but we have not yet fully explored whether our group is more comfortable with a bold, higher-risk approach or prefers a steady, confidence-building path for our inaugural investment. By giving everyone space to explicitly voice concerns or enthusiasm about risk, we can ensure that our decision is not only strategically sound but also fully owned by the team. This deeper reflection will help us reach a more robust and unified consensus before moving to a proposal and vote.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Anaya Cooke has set the theme: &#x27;Assessing company risk appetite and alignment with team values | Expected outcome: Clarify our collective comfort with risk and how it matches each asset’s profile, surfacing any concerns or enthusiasm about bold versus conservative choices&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Anaya Cooke My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because after this round, I find real estate’s combination of steady returns, lower risk, and strong potential to build team unity and confidence especially persuasive. The cultural impact of a visible, shared asset feels like the right move for our company’s launch, and the idea of using this as a springboard for bolder investments later is strategically sound. While stocks are still appealing for their growth and excitement, I believe real estate better aligns with both our financial goals and the team spirit we want to cultivate at this early stage, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, let’s focus on openly assessing our collective comfort with risk—do we want to set an ambitious tone with higher potential returns, or prioritize confidence-building and stability as we lay our foundation? By surfacing any concerns or enthusiasm around bold versus conservative choices, we can better align our decision with both our financial objectives and the culture we want to build. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share their honest perspectives—especially any insights or reservations I may not have fully considered—so we can reach a decision that truly reflects our shared values and appetite for risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gabrielle Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Gabrielle Johnson: &quot;I’m genuinely enthusiastic about the idea of starting with real estate because it gives us something real to rally around and celebrate together, which feels especially important as we’re building our identity and trust as a team. While I love the energy that comes from bold moves, I think choosing steady growth now lets us stay motivated and adaptable, and sets us up to take on bigger risks—like stocks—once we’ve established some early wins and momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve articulated the importance of having a tangible asset to unify and energize us right from the start. Your point about building momentum through steady growth resonates with me, especially since it creates room for us to be even bolder down the line. I’d love to hear if others feel similarly about starting with stability, or if there’s strong enthusiasm for jumping straight into a higher-risk, higher-reward asset like stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gabrielle Johnson: &quot;I completely agree that starting with real estate doesn’t mean we’re playing it safe in a boring way—it’s about building the trust and confidence we’ll need to go after those big, bold opportunities together. In my view, steady progress now will give us the momentum and shared excitement to take on higher risks, like stocks, when the timing feels right and the whole team is on board. This approach lets us celebrate early wins as a group and keeps our energy high for whatever comes next.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I completely agree that steady progress can be just as exciting as bold moves when it’s building trust and shared momentum—your framing of real estate as a springboard for future ambition really brings that to life. It’s reassuring to hear how this approach could actually fuel our appetite for bigger risks down the road, rather than dampen it. I’d be interested in hearing from anyone who feels that a bolder start with stocks would better capture our team’s spirit, or if there are any reservations about the pace and energy that real estate could bring.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gabrielle Johnson chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Luna Holmes</h4></p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;I’m genuinely excited by how much momentum and unity we could build by starting with real estate—it feels like the perfect mix of boldness and stability for our first step. While I totally get the thrill of jumping straight into stocks, I think having a shared, tangible win right out of the gate will boost our confidence and make us even more ready to go after those high-reward opportunities together in future quarters. For me, it’s about keeping the energy high while making sure everyone feels secure and motivated as we launch our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve captured the balance between ambition and security—your point about real estate providing both a confidence boost and a springboard for future boldness is spot on. I agree that starting with a tangible win can energize us and build the unity we need to take on bigger risks together. I’d like to hear if anyone feels that jumping straight into stocks would better set the tone for our company, or if there are any concerns about real estate not being bold enough for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;I really appreciate how open you are to both ambition and stability—I think it’s important to remember that team confidence can actually fuel our appetite for risk as we go. If we start with real estate and celebrate that win together, I believe it will make us even more comfortable and excited to pursue bolder options like stocks in the next quarters. That way, we’re not just playing it safe—we’re building up the trust and energy that let us take bigger leaps, together, when the timing is right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I love how you’ve framed this—not as a choice between boldness and caution, but as a way to build the kind of trust and shared excitement that empowers us to take bigger risks together down the line. Your perspective really brings home that a confident, unified team is more likely to embrace ambitious opportunities as they arise. I’m eager to hear if anyone feels that starting with stocks would better spark our momentum, or if there are any concerns about real estate not delivering enough excitement for our launch.&quot;</p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;I think it’s worth highlighting that the excitement of a bold move doesn’t have to come only from taking the highest risk right away—sometimes the real spark comes from seeing our team succeed together and realizing we’re ready for more. If anyone feels that real estate might not be energizing enough, I’d love to hear what would make that first step feel truly motivating for them, or if there’s a way to keep that energy high as we build momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really appreciate your focus on how shared success can spark just as much excitement as taking a big risk. I agree that our first win—if it’s real estate—should be celebrated in a way that feels bold and energizing for everyone. I’d love to hear concrete ideas from the team about how we can make this initial step feel truly motivating, so we keep our momentum strong no matter which asset we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
Luna Holmes: &quot;One idea could be to mark our first real estate investment with a team celebration and a visible update—maybe sharing progress photos or even a fun team visit if possible—to make the achievement feel tangible and exciting. Highlighting each milestone together will help everyone feel connected to the success, keeping our momentum and enthusiasm high as we look ahead to even bolder steps.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I absolutely love your idea, Luna—making our progress visible and celebrating each milestone together is exactly the kind of energy I want us to bring to this journey. Turning our first investment into a shared experience will not only boost our motivation but also make the achievement feel real and memorable for everyone. If others have creative ways to keep our momentum and excitement high—whether we choose real estate or another asset—I’d love to hear them.&quot;</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Maximillian Wise</h4></p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I completely agree with Gabrielle and Luna that starting with real estate gives us a visible, shared achievement and a real sense of momentum, which fits our team’s positive energy perfectly. For me, the excitement comes from seeing quick, tangible progress we can all rally around—something that will boost our confidence and make us even more ready to take on bolder moves like stocks in future quarters. I’m all for ambition, but I think building that trust and unity first will set us up to be even more daring together as we go.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted the excitement that comes from quick, visible progress and how that can actually amplify our ambition as a team. Your emphasis on building trust and unity first resonates with me—it makes a lot of sense that establishing a strong foundation now will give us the confidence to pursue even bolder opportunities together. If anyone feels that a more aggressive approach with stocks would better capture our team’s spirit, or has thoughts on balancing excitement with stability, I’d love to hear your perspective.&quot;</p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I think it’s important to recognize that being bold doesn’t always mean taking the biggest risk right away—sometimes it’s about building up our collective confidence so we’re truly ready to seize high-reward opportunities together. By celebrating our first real estate win as a team, we can channel that energy and trust into even bolder moves, like stocks, when the time is right. That way, we’re not just playing it safe—we’re setting ourselves up to be both ambitious and resilient as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really like how you’ve reframed boldness—not as just taking the biggest risk up front, but as building the kind of collective confidence that lets us seize high-reward opportunities when we’re truly ready. Your point about channeling the energy from a shared real estate win into even bolder moves later really speaks to how we can be both ambitious and resilient as a team. If anyone feels that a different approach would better capture our spirit or has concerns about this path, I’d love to hear your thoughts so we can make the most informed and unified decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise: &quot;I’d love to hear from anyone who feels strongly that starting with stocks would better capture our ambition, or if there are specific conditions that would make a bolder move feel right in future quarters. I think keeping this dialogue open ensures we stay adaptable and ready to pivot as our confidence and market conditions evolve, which is key to building both trust and momentum as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really appreciate your focus on keeping the dialogue open and adaptable, Maximillian—it’s essential that we stay responsive to both our team’s confidence and changing market conditions. Your invitation for others to share what would make a bolder move like stocks feel right—either now or in the future—helps ensure we’re not missing any hidden enthusiasm or concerns. I encourage anyone who feels strongly about starting with stocks, or who has thoughts on when we should consider taking bigger risks, to share their perspective now so we can make the most balanced and forward-looking decision together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Maximillian Wise chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Rosie Trujillo</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong perspective on how our company’s appetite for risk and team values intersect, and I want to ensure the excitement and momentum stocks can bring aren’t overlooked, even as I appreciate the confidence-building arguments for real estate.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo: &quot;I’m genuinely energized by the idea of starting boldly with stocks because I think a high-energy move can set a dynamic tone and unify us through shared ambition, especially in a stable market where the risks are manageable. While I absolutely see the appeal of real estate for building confidence and celebrating quick, tangible wins, I believe that channeling our optimism into a bold first step could spark excitement and create a lasting sense of pride in our culture. For me, it’s about capturing this unique moment to show we’re ready to aim high together—and I’d love to hear how others feel about balancing immediate excitement with the steady progress real estate offers.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Rosie, I really appreciate your passion for setting a dynamic, ambitious tone—it’s clear that starting with stocks could send a powerful message about who we are as a team. Your point about seizing this unique moment to unify us through shared excitement is compelling, and I’d love to hear if others feel that the immediate energy from a bold move outweighs the benefits of building confidence through steady progress. Let’s open the floor to any thoughts on how we can best balance excitement and momentum with the foundation we want to set for our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I can add valuable nuance by highlighting how excitement and steady progress can actually reinforce each other, and invite others to consider how we might intentionally design our first investment to maximize both energy and confidence.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo: &quot;I really appreciate your openness, Anaya. I actually think the excitement of a bold move and the confidence from a steady win don’t have to be at odds—if we’re intentional, we can make our first investment feel both energizing and grounding for everyone. Maybe the key is making sure that, whatever we choose, we celebrate it in a way that brings out the best of both worlds—so our team feels proud, motivated, and ready for bigger leaps ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I really like how you’ve reframed this, Rosie—the way we celebrate and communicate our first investment can absolutely set the tone, no matter which asset we choose. Your idea of intentionally making our first step both energizing and grounding is a great reminder that culture is shaped not just by the asset itself, but by how we rally around it as a team. I’d welcome any other thoughts on how we can maximize both excitement and unity as we launch our investment journey.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response invites concrete ideas for maximizing excitement and unity, and I can offer a practical suggestion that builds on the group’s themes while advancing our shared understanding.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo: &quot;One thought is that we could make our first investment—whether it’s stocks or real estate—a real event for the team, with a kickoff celebration and regular, creative updates that keep everyone involved and excited about our progress. By spotlighting both the boldness of our choice and the milestones we reach along the way, we can create a shared sense of pride and momentum that carries us forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;I absolutely love your idea, Rosie—turning our first investment into a true team event with ongoing celebrations and creative updates is exactly the kind of energy and unity I want us to foster. By spotlighting both the boldness of our choice and the milestones we achieve, we can keep everyone motivated and proud, no matter which asset we select. If anyone else has ideas for keeping our momentum strong and making this journey memorable, I’d love to hear them as we move toward our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has enthusiastically embraced my suggestion and reinforced the value of intentional celebration and communication, fully integrating the nuance I wanted to add. At this point, further comments from me would likely be redundant rather than advancing the group’s understanding.</p><p><br>
Rosie Trujillo chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Huw Dalton</h4></p><p><br>
Huw Dalton: &quot;I’m genuinely energized by the idea of setting an ambitious tone right from the start—stocks feel like a bold move that could really unify us through shared excitement, especially since the market is stable and we can adapt each quarter. That said, I really appreciate how much value the team sees in building early confidence with real estate, and I think whichever path we choose, the way we celebrate and communicate our progress will be key to keeping everyone motivated and ready for even bigger steps ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke: &quot;Huw, I really appreciate your balanced perspective—recognizing both the unifying excitement of a bold move with stocks and the value of building confidence through real estate.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Rosie Trujillo UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 7%<br>
- Real Estate: 48%<br>
- Stocks: 43%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments came from Gabrielle, Luna, and Maximillian, who made a strong case for real estate as a confidence-building, unifying first step that provides tangible progress and momentum. I was especially swayed by their emphasis on team celebrations, visible milestones, and the idea that a steady win now could set us up for even bolder moves in the future. The CEO’s thoughtful shift toward real estate, based on the cultural and motivational benefits, also carried weight. However, Huw’s and my own arguments about the energizing, ambitious tone that stocks could set—especially if we’re intentional about celebration and communication—kept my confidence in stocks high.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round deepened my appreciation for how much the “how” of our first investment—celebrating, communicating, and rallying the team—matters, sometimes as much as the “what.” I’ve become more open to the idea that real estate can be just as energizing as stocks if we approach it with creativity and shared enthusiasm. My thinking now balances my instinct for boldness with a greater respect for the foundational benefits of a steady, visible win. I see now that building unity and confidence early could actually fuel our appetite for risk later, rather than dampen it.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I’m shifting my preference to real estate because I now believe that a visible, confidence-building win will unify and motivate our team, creating a strong foundation for future bold moves. The arguments for steady momentum, tangible progress, and the power of team celebration have convinced me this is the right path for our launch. While I still value the excitement of stocks, I see that we can cultivate that energy through how we frame and celebrate our achievements, regardless of the asset. Real estate aligns best with our team’s current needs and sets us up for long-term ambition.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Anaya Cooke decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We have thoroughly explored the core tradeoffs between boldness and stability, and the discussion has surfaced all key perspectives regarding risk appetite, team values, and the motivational impact of each option. There is a clear and thoughtful majority preference for real estate, with strong consensus on the importance of unity, confidence-building, and celebration—while also honoring the value of ambition and future boldness. Further discussion would likely yield diminishing returns, as all substantive concerns and ideas have been addressed. I am confident we are ready to move forward with a proposal and vote, ensuring our decision is both strategically sound and fully owned by the team.</p><p><br>

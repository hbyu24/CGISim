<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Kobi Hewitt’s Structured Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting – Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I decisively advocated for Option C, emphasizing the strategic advantage of allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. I positioned this as the optimal balance between maximizing growth potential and minimizing timing risk in our stable market environment. The CEO, Nadine Vega, responded positively to my input, highlighting the importance of transparency, collaboration, and adaptability alongside discipline—values I strongly endorse as an ENFJ focused on collective well-being and team cohesion. Other shareholders echoed my preference for Option C, reinforcing a unanimous consensus that strengthened my confidence. The final vote reflected this consensus, with all six shareholders including myself approving Option C. My preferred option was fully adopted as the company’s budget allocation strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Nadine Vega demonstrated strong leadership by framing the discussion with clarity and fostering an inclusive, collaborative environment. Her skillful synthesis of shareholder perspectives into a shared vision was evident when she acknowledged each contribution and integrated points about discipline, adaptability, and culture. For example, her repeated emphasis on balancing growth with prudent risk management and building a foundation of shared accountability highlighted her strength in aligning financial strategy with company values. One area for improvement could be to proactively surface potential market uncertainties and outline contingency frameworks earlier in the discussion to deepen preparedness beyond the current stable outlook. The decision-making process was highly effective this meeting, characterized by open dialogue, unanimous agreement, and a well-structured summary that clarified rationale and next steps. The final decision to adopt Option C appears well-founded and advantageous for the company, positioning us for steady growth while fostering a resilient, collaborative culture that aligns with our long-term goals.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the critical role of transparent, collaborative dialogue in reaching effective consensus—particularly in my role as an ENFJ shareholder who values harmony and shared purpose. I learned that aligning financial decisions with cultural values enhances buy-in and collective commitment, which I will continue to emphasize in future meetings. Going forward, I plan to proactively highlight adaptability as a dynamic complement to discipline, ensuring flexibility remains a core theme as market conditions evolve. I noticed a clear pattern where detailed, values-based arguments combined with practical risk assessments strongly influence outcomes; anticipating and framing discussions this way can help me predict and shape group consensus more effectively. Key takeaways include the importance of integrating strategic foresight with empathetic communication to build trust and cohesion, a lesson that will inform my future participation and support the company’s sustained success.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Nadine Vega opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Kobi Hewitt CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 45%<br>
- Stocks: 30%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: In this stable market environment, I believe real estate presents the optimal balance between growth potential and manageable risk. While stocks are tempting for their higher returns, the moderate volatility introduces uncertainty that feels unnecessary given our steady economic backdrop. Bonds are reliable but may limit our upside in such favorable conditions, and cash is too conservative for our growth objectives. Real estate aligns with my desire to pursue ambitious yet prudent strategies, and it supports the collaborative, disciplined culture we established in the annual meeting. I feel confident that this choice will foster both immediate progress and long-term stability for the company.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Nadine Vega has set the theme: &#x27;Analyzing theoretical performance of each asset class in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Establish a shared understanding of expected risk-return profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Nadine Vega My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I believe that in our current stable and predictable market environment, stocks present the best opportunity to achieve strong growth for our first quarterly investment. While stocks do carry higher risk, the overall low volatility and steady economic outlook reduce the likelihood of significant losses, making this an opportune moment to capitalize on their upside potential. Real estate is also appealing for its reliability and moderate returns, but I feel that starting with a more growth-oriented position will set a confident tone for our company’s ambitions. My preference for stocks is grounded in a desire to balance prudent risk-taking with our shared objective of disciplined, collaborative progress, and I remain open to thoughtful discussion if compelling cases are made for other asset classes, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, our focus is to collaboratively analyze the theoretical performance and risk-return profiles of cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks in this stable market so we can establish a shared foundation for our decision-making. I encourage everyone to share their perspectives so we can synthesize a well-rounded understanding that reflects both collective wisdom and our company’s goals. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I welcome your thoughtful insights, especially if you have considerations I may not have fully addressed.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Zayd Mason</h4></p><p><br>
Zayd Mason: &quot;I appreciate the emphasis on growth potential with stocks, especially given the stable market, but I see real estate as offering a compelling balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk. In this environment, real estate’s reliability and potential for both financial and positive social impact stand out, particularly as we establish our investment track record. While stocks are attractive for upside, starting with real estate could set a strong foundation for disciplined, sustainable growth aligned with our company’s long-term vision.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Zayd, for articulating the strengths of real estate in this context. I see real merit in your point that real estate’s steady appreciation and moderate risk could provide both financial consistency and a positive reputation as we build our track record. Your emphasis on sustainability and alignment with our long-term vision is a valuable lens, and I’d like to hear whether others share this view or see additional factors that might further inform our understanding of the risk-return profiles at play.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zayd Mason: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the reputational benefits alongside financial consistency. As we consider risk-return profiles, I think it’s also worth noting that real estate’s tangible nature can foster trust among stakeholders and signal our commitment to stability, which could be valuable as we build early credibility. I’d be interested to hear if anyone sees similar reputational or stakeholder engagement advantages in other asset classes.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;I appreciate your point about the reputational advantages of holding tangible assets like real estate, Zayd. It’s important to consider how our initial investments might influence stakeholder perceptions and credibility, especially as we build our company’s identity. I’d welcome any insights from others on whether similar reputational or engagement benefits might apply to bonds, stocks, or even cash, as this could further refine our collective understanding of each asset’s broader value in the current market.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zayd Mason: &quot;While real estate’s tangibility offers clear reputational benefits, I can see that bonds might signal fiscal responsibility and a commitment to steady stewardship, which could reassure more risk-averse stakeholders. Stocks, on the other hand, could project ambition and confidence in growth, appealing to partners who value innovation and performance, while holding a portion in cash might be interpreted as prioritizing flexibility and prudence. Recognizing these varied reputational signals helps us weigh not just financial returns, but also the broader message our first investment sends as we shape the company’s identity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Zayd, for articulating how each asset class could project different values and commitments to our stakeholders. Weighing the reputational impact alongside financial performance gives us a more holistic view of what our first investment will signal about our company’s priorities and culture. I encourage the rest of the team to share if they see additional reputational or strategic implications tied to these options, as this will help us make a more intentional and well-rounded decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zayd Mason chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Ashley Coleman</h4></p><p><br>
Ashley Coleman: &quot;I agree that real estate stands out in a stable market for its reliable appreciation and moderate risk, but what resonates most with me is how investing in tangible assets can visibly demonstrate our commitment to sustainable, long-term growth—both financially and within the communities we serve. While stocks may offer higher potential returns, I’m mindful that starting with real estate could help us build early credibility and trust, reinforcing our reputation as disciplined, socially conscious investors as we establish our track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Ashley, for highlighting how investing in real estate can tangibly demonstrate our commitment to sustainable, long-term growth and community impact. Your emphasis on early credibility and trust aligns well with our broader goal of building a disciplined, socially conscious reputation, and I see real value in considering how our first investment can set the tone for both financial performance and stakeholder relationships. I encourage others to weigh in on whether these visible, community-focused benefits might outweigh the higher growth potential of stocks, or if there are additional factors we should consider as we refine our understanding.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ashley Coleman: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our first investment can set the tone for both performance and stakeholder relationships. To build on that, I think real estate’s steady returns and visible presence not only support credibility, but can also anchor our portfolio with a sense of stability as we pursue growth in future quarters—potentially allowing us to take more calculated risks with stocks later on, once we’ve established a solid foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Ashley, for articulating how real estate could serve as an anchor for our portfolio, providing stability and credibility that might enable us to pursue more ambitious growth opportunities with stocks in subsequent quarters. Your perspective on sequencing our investments to build a strong foundation is a valuable addition to our analysis, and I invite others to share whether they see similar benefits in this approach or if they believe starting with a higher-growth asset like stocks would better serve our objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ashley Coleman: &quot;I think the sequencing argument is especially relevant in a stable market—by anchoring our portfolio with real estate now, we not only gain steady returns and credibility, but also increase our flexibility to pursue higher-growth assets like stocks later, knowing we have a reliable base. This approach could help us balance ambition with responsibility, demonstrating both prudent stewardship and a willingness to capitalize on future opportunities as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Ashley, I appreciate how you’ve articulated the sequencing argument, highlighting how real estate could anchor our portfolio and enhance our flexibility for future growth-oriented investments. This perspective deepens our analysis of how early decisions can shape both our risk management and our ability to pursue ambition as the company evolves. I’d like to pause here to invite additional viewpoints from the rest of the team so we can ensure a well-rounded discussion before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ashley Coleman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Kobi Hewitt</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help synthesize the valuable points raised so far and further clarify how real estate’s risk-return profile aligns with both our growth objectives and company values in this stable market.</p><p><br>
Kobi Hewitt: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful analysis from both Zayd and Ashley regarding real estate’s steady appreciation and its reputational benefits as a tangible, community-focused asset. Building on these points, I see real estate as offering a disciplined path to growth—its moderate risk and reliable returns fit well with our collaborative, long-term vision, especially as we establish credibility in our first year. While stocks are appealing for their higher upside, I feel that real estate’s stability and alignment with our values make it the optimal starting point for balanced, sustainable progress.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Kobi, for bringing together the themes of disciplined growth, stability, and alignment with our collaborative values. Your emphasis on real estate’s fit with our long-term vision and its role in establishing early credibility adds meaningful depth to our discussion. I’d like to invite any remaining perspectives, especially from those who may see unique advantages in stocks, bonds, or cash, so we can ensure our analysis is as comprehensive as possible before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response invites further synthesis and integration of perspectives, and I see an opportunity to highlight how considering both reputational and financial factors can enhance our collective decision-making.</p><p><br>
Kobi Hewitt: &quot;I’d like to add that weighing both the reputational impact and financial risk-return profiles of each asset class helps ensure our decision reflects not just immediate performance, but also the long-term values we want to project as a company. This holistic approach can strengthen our foundation as disciplined, forward-thinking investors, and I’m eager to hear if others see any additional dimensions—such as adaptability or stakeholder engagement—that might further inform our choice.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Kobi, for underscoring the value of a holistic approach that considers both immediate financial outcomes and the broader values and adaptability we wish to embody as a company. I agree that integrating these dimensions will help us make a more intentional and resilient choice, and I encourage the team to share any further perspectives—whether on adaptability, stakeholder engagement, or other strategic factors—that could enrich our collective understanding of each asset class in this context.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s encouragement to consider additional strategic factors, such as adaptability and stakeholder engagement, presents an opportunity to further integrate these dimensions into our analysis and help the group reach a more nuanced, well-rounded decision.</p><p><br>
Kobi Hewitt: &quot;I appreciate your invitation to deepen our analysis by considering adaptability and stakeholder engagement. In my view, real estate not only offers financial stability but also provides us with flexibility to respond to evolving market needs and opportunities for community partnership, which can enhance our reputation and stakeholder trust. Balancing these strategic factors alongside risk and return will ensure our first investment sets a strong precedent for both performance and company culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Kobi, for highlighting how real estate can provide both stability and adaptability, as well as opportunities for deeper community partnership and stakeholder trust. Your point reinforces the importance of aligning our investment not only with risk-return expectations, but also with the values and relationships we want to cultivate as a company. I’d now like to open the floor to additional voices so we can ensure every perspective is considered as we build a comprehensive foundation for our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I believe I have already synthesized and integrated the key dimensions—financial, reputational, adaptability, and stakeholder engagement—into our analysis, and further comment would risk redundancy rather than adding new value at this stage.</p><p><br>
Kobi Hewitt chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jan Orozco</h4></p><p><br>
Jan Orozco: &quot;I appreciate the strong cases made for real estate as a foundation for both financial stability and stakeholder trust, especially as we build our company’s identity. While I recognize the growth potential in stocks, I’m inclined to prioritize real estate this quarter because its moderate risk and steady returns offer the kind of disciplined progress and credibility that can empower us to take more ambitious steps in future quarters, once we’ve established a reliable track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Jan, for articulating the value of establishing credibility and disciplined progress through real estate, especially as we shape our company’s identity in this first quarter. Your point about using real estate as a springboard for more ambitious investments in the future resonates with the sequencing strategy discussed earlier and reinforces the importance of building a reliable track record. I encourage others to reflect on whether this approach best aligns with our goals, or if starting with a higher-growth asset like stocks might better serve our objectives in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jan Orozco: &quot;I see real value in your point about the potential for stocks to set an ambitious tone, and I agree that the stable market does reduce some risk. However, I believe that beginning with real estate allows us to balance ambition with discipline—demonstrating prudent stewardship now, which can give us both the credibility and flexibility to pursue higher-growth opportunities like stocks in subsequent quarters. This approach supports both immediate stability and long-term adaptability as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Jan, for articulating how starting with real estate can balance ambition with prudent stewardship, supporting both our credibility and future flexibility. Your perspective reinforces the value of sequencing—using real estate as a disciplined foundation before pursuing higher-growth opportunities—which aligns with several thoughtful points raised in this discussion. I encourage the rest of the team to reflect on whether this approach best positions us for both immediate stability and long-term adaptability, or if the growth potential of stocks in this stable market should take precedence in our first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jan Orozco: &quot;I’d like to add that by establishing a strong, stable foundation with real estate now, we not only gain credibility and steady returns but also position ourselves to respond nimbly to any shifts in the market. This adaptability is crucial—if conditions remain favorable, we can confidently pursue higher-growth assets like stocks in the coming quarters, knowing we’ve anchored our portfolio with prudent, reliable progress.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Jan, for emphasizing how a strong foundation in real estate can enhance our adaptability and readiness to pursue higher-growth opportunities as market conditions evolve. Your point about using prudent, reliable progress as a platform for future ambition resonates with our collective desire for both stability and flexibility. I’d now like to open the floor to additional voices, so we can ensure every perspective is considered as we move toward a well-rounded decision.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Yahya Fry</h4></p><p><br>
Yahya Fry: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful analysis from everyone so far—especially the points about real estate’s steady appreciation and its ability to anchor our portfolio with both credibility and flexibility. In my view, real estate offers an optimal balance of moderate risk and reliable returns, fitting our collective appetite for disciplined growth while minimizing exposure to the volatility that stocks might introduce, even in a stable market. By starting with real estate, we not only position ourselves for sustainable progress but also reinforce our commitment to prudent, adaptable decision-making that can support more ambitious moves in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Yahya, for encapsulating the strengths of real estate in balancing moderate risk with reliable returns and highlighting its role in anchoring our portfolio for disciplined, sustainable growth. Your emphasis on prudent, adaptable decision-making and the sequencing of our investments aligns closely with many thoughtful points raised today. I encourage any final reflections from the group, particularly if there are additional considerations around stocks or other asset classes, so we can ensure our decision is as comprehensive and intentional as possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Yahya Fry: &quot;I appreciate the CEO’s encouragement to consider stocks as well. While stocks do offer higher potential returns in a stable market, I believe the risk of early volatility—even if reduced—could undermine the disciplined foundation we’re aiming to establish. By starting with real estate, we gain steady progress and credibility, which can empower us to pursue higher-growth opportunities like stocks with greater confidence and flexibility in subsequent quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Nadine Vega: &quot;Thank you, Yahya, for articulating the importance of establishing a disciplined foundation with real estate before pursuing higher-growth opportunities like stocks. Your point about steady progress and credibility empowering future ambition captures the essence of the sequencing strategy discussed throughout our meeting. I appreciate how you’ve weighed both risk and adaptability, and I invite any final thoughts from the group before we move toward a decision on our Q1 investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Yahya Fry: &quot;I want to thank everyone for the depth of analysis and openness in this discussion. Synthesizing our perspectives, it’s clear that starting with real estate allows us to balance prudent risk management, credible progress, and adaptability—laying a strong foundation for both our company’s reputation and future ambition. I believe this collaborative approach ensures our decision is not only analytically sound but also aligned with the values and culture we’re striving to build.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Nadine Vega summarized: &quot;Nadine Vega **Round 1 Summary – Quarterly Investment Meeting, Year 1 Q1**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Theme and Objective:**  <br>
This round focused on analyzing the theoretical performance of each asset class—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in the current stable market. The objective was to establish a shared understanding of the expected risk-return profiles for each option, laying the groundwork for our first investment decision.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders:**  <br>
- I initially expressed a preference for stocks, emphasizing their growth potential in a stable, low-volatility market, while remaining open to other perspectives.  <br>
- Zayd Mason, Ashley Coleman, Kobi Hewitt, Jan Orozco, and Yahya Fry all advocated for real estate as the optimal starting point, highlighting its steady appreciation, moderate risk, and reputational benefits.  <br>
- No shareholders expressed a preference for bonds or cash, though Zayd briefly noted their reputational signals.</p><p>3. **Highlighted Arguments and Evidence for Each Option:**  <br>
- **Stocks:** Supported for their high growth potential in a stable market with reduced volatility. Seen as a statement of ambition and confidence, but concerns were raised about the risk of early volatility potentially undermining disciplined progress.  <br>
- **Real Estate:** Viewed as providing reliable appreciation, moderate risk, and tangible, visible commitment to sustainable growth. Shareholders emphasized its role in establishing credibility, anchoring the portfolio, enhancing stakeholder trust, and enabling future flexibility to pursue higher-growth assets.  <br>
- **Bonds:** Briefly mentioned as signaling fiscal responsibility and steady stewardship, but not strongly advocated.  <br>
- **Cash:** Noted for signaling prudence and flexibility, but not considered a primary option in the current environment.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement:**  <br>
- **Consensus:** The majority of shareholders agree on the value of real estate’s steady returns, moderate risk, and reputational benefits as a disciplined foundation. There is strong alignment around the sequencing strategy: starting with real estate to establish credibility and stability, then considering higher-growth assets like stocks in future quarters.  <br>
- **Disagreement:** My initial preference for stocks reflects a greater appetite for immediate growth, while the group collectively prioritized disciplined progress and reputational considerations. The discussion constructively weighed ambition against stewardship, with the group favoring a prudent foundation before pursuing higher-return opportunities.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme:**  <br>
We have thoroughly evaluated the risk-return profiles of each asset class in the context of a stable market, integrating both financial and reputational considerations. The discussion has established a clear, shared understanding of how each option aligns with our company’s values, risk appetite, and long-term objectives. The sequencing argument—anchoring with real estate before pursuing stocks—emerged as a well-supported, strategic approach.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options:**  <br>
I want to reiterate that our decision must be made from the four predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks. All discussion remained focused on these valid choices, and no alternatives outside this set were proposed.</p><p>7. **Next Steps or Issues to Address:**  <br>
Our next step will be to assess our collective risk tolerance and alignment with company objectives for this first investment, building on the strong foundation established in this round. I encourage everyone to reflect on whether the sequencing strategy best serves our goals or if there are additional factors—such as changing market conditions or evolving company priorities—that should be considered before finalizing our decision.</p><p>Thank you all for your thoughtful, collaborative engagement and for contributing to a robust, values-driven analysis as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

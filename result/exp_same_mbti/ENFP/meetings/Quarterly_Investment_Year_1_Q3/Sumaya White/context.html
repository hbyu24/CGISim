<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I firmly advocated for Option C, emphasizing its alignment with our optimistic outlook and the stable market environment. I highlighted that allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters allows us to maximize growth opportunities while managing risk through balanced exposure. I also stressed the importance of this approach in fostering a collaborative and adaptable team culture, which is vital for our company’s long-term success.</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner responded very positively to my input, affirming the dual benefits of Option C for both financial outcomes and team development. He appreciated my focus on active involvement and learning throughout the year, which added significant weight to the collective case for Option C. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, resulting in unanimous support for this option.</p><p>The voting outcome was unanimous: all six shareholders, including myself and the CEO, approved Option C. The final company decision was to allocate 100% of the budget evenly across all four quarters, fully embracing the opportunities presented by a stable market. My preferred option was indeed adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the chosen strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated strong leadership by fostering an open, inclusive discussion that encouraged thoughtful contributions from all shareholders. For example, his repeated acknowledgments of individual inputs, including mine, helped reinforce a culture of collaboration and mutual respect. His framing of Option C as both bold and prudent set a positive tone that galvanized consensus.</p><p>One area for improvement would be to further encourage more diverse or challenging viewpoints in future meetings. Although the unanimous agreement on Option C reflected strong alignment, the CEO himself noted the value of surfacing any quiet concerns early on. Enhancing feedback mechanisms and inviting creative debate could deepen decision quality and innovation.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process worked effectively in this meeting, characterized by structured discussion rounds, clear themes, and a focus on predefined options. The process balanced thorough exploration of financial and cultural factors, leading to a robust consensus without evident dissent. The final decision to adopt Option C appears well-suited for the company’s current stable market context and growth ambitions, positioning us for both immediate returns and long-term resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced for me the power of shared optimism combined with disciplined analysis in driving consensus. I learned that articulating how financial strategies connect to cultural values—such as collaboration, adaptability, and learning—can deepen collective conviction and strengthen team cohesion. The unanimous endorsement of Option C highlighted how well-aligned values and objectives foster efficient, confident decision-making.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing this integrated perspective, linking strategic choices to both quantitative outcomes and qualitative team dynamics. I might also proactively invite alternative viewpoints to ensure any latent concerns are addressed early, thereby enriching our dialogue and decision robustness.</p><p>I noticed a clear pattern that when the CEO actively validates individual contributions and ties them to the broader vision, it encourages deeper engagement and consensus. Recognizing this dynamic will help me better read group sentiment and tailor my interventions to reinforce alignment or gently challenge where needed.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of framing decisions with both heart and reason, nurturing a culture of openness and adaptability, and supporting the CEO’s efforts to cultivate inclusive dialogue. These practices will help me contribute constructively to shaping strategies that are not only financially sound but also culturally empowering for our company’s growth journey.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in stocks for Q1, emphasizing their high return potential and the opportunity to set an energetic, optimistic tone for our company. I acknowledged the steady, trust-building qualities of real estate but maintained that stocks were the best fit given the stable market environment and our team&#x27;s strong adaptability. Throughout the three discussion rounds, I contributed by synthesizing diverse viewpoints, highlighting the importance of balancing bold ambition with foundational resilience, and stressing the value of intentional sequencing and integration of real estate’s strengths alongside stocks. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my inputs, appreciating the nuanced balance I proposed and affirming our shared commitment to learning and adaptability. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, ultimately converging on stocks as the preferred investment. The final voting outcome was unanimous (6/6), approving stocks as our Q1 investment. My preferred option was fully adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the decision and our collaborative process.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated exemplary leadership by fostering an open, inclusive environment that encouraged thoughtful, multi-perspective discussion. For example, his repeated affirmations of individual contributions—including my emphasis on strategic sequencing and cultural impacts—helped build a cohesive, collaborative culture. He skillfully balanced his initial bias for stocks with genuine openness to real estate’s value, reflecting adaptability and responsiveness to shareholder insights. One area for improvement is further encouraging early expression of quieter concerns or alternative viewpoints to deepen debate, as the CEO himself acknowledged. The decision-making process was structured and thorough, progressing logically through risk-return analysis, cultural considerations, and consensus-building, culminating in a well-reasoned unanimous vote. I believe the final decision to invest in stocks is well-suited for our current stable market context and team dynamics, positioning the company for both immediate momentum and long-term resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of blending quantitative analysis with qualitative cultural insights to drive effective decision-making. I learned that articulating how investment choices influence team psychology, confidence, and adaptability can deepen collective alignment beyond purely financial arguments. Going forward, I plan to continue framing contributions that integrate bold strategic ambition with steady, trust-building principles—helping the group navigate tradeoffs with nuance. I also recognize the value of proactively inviting alternative or quieter perspectives early in discussions to enrich dialogue and preempt latent reservations. A clear pattern emerged: when the CEO actively validates individual inputs and ties them to the broader company vision, stakeholder engagement and consensus strengthen noticeably. My key takeaway is that fostering a culture of openness, intentional integration, and adaptability will be essential for guiding future meetings toward decisions that are both financially sound and culturally empowering. This insight will guide my participation to support collaborative, confident strategy-setting that balances immediate opportunity with sustained growth.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Sumaya White’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for investing in stocks for Q2, emphasizing their strong growth potential demonstrated by the outstanding 20% return last quarter and alignment with our team’s creative, adaptable, and optimistic culture. I also highlighted the importance of balancing this bold ambition with the steady, trust-building qualities of real estate, suggesting that integrating real estate’s resilience through cultural practices like open feedback and reflection would strengthen our approach. CEO Ollie Conner responded very positively to my input, affirming the need to sustain momentum while intentionally reinforcing psychological safety and trust. Other shareholders echoed similar views, consistently supporting stocks as the preferred asset but underlining the value of real estate’s stabilizing role. The voting outcome was unanimous (6/6), approving investment in stocks for Q2. My preferred option was fully adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the chosen strategy and the collaborative process that integrated both financial and cultural considerations.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner excelled in fostering an inclusive, reflective, and forward-looking discussion. He skillfully balanced his initial enthusiasm for stocks with a genuine openness to shareholder perspectives emphasizing resilience and trust-building, such as when he acknowledged my points about integrating real estate’s grounding qualities alongside pursuing momentum. His leadership was evident in how he encouraged synthesis of financial returns with cultural values, reinforcing adaptability and psychological safety as core to sustainable growth. One area for improvement is his recognition, noted in the meeting conclusion, to encourage earlier surfacing of quieter or dissenting voices and to formalize ongoing feedback loops more explicitly. The company’s decision-making process was highly effective: structured, transparent, and integrative, allowing thorough exploration of risk-return profiles while embedding cultural dimensions. The final decision to invest in stocks appears well-suited for our stable market context and growth-oriented culture, balancing boldness with a commitment to sustaining trust and resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting deepened my understanding of how financial and cultural factors intertwine in our decision-making dynamics. I learned that articulating the connection between investment choices and team culture—such as how stocks energize creative momentum while real estate fosters psychological safety—helps build stronger consensus that embraces both ambition and resilience. Recognizing the group’s strong preference for stocks, I also appreciated the broad commitment to intentionally integrating real estate’s stabilizing qualities through concrete mechanisms like regular feedback and reflection. For future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing this balanced perspective and proactively invite diverse viewpoints earlier to enrich dialogue and uncover latent concerns. I noticed a clear pattern that when the CEO actively validates individual contributions and frames decisions in terms of both financial outcomes and cultural impact, it fosters deeper engagement and alignment. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of framing decisions holistically—with both heart and reason—supporting inclusive dialogue, and anchoring bold strategies in a resilient, trust-based culture. These insights will guide me in helping shape strategies that deliver strong returns while nurturing a vibrant, adaptive team.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25593.75 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Stocks, Return: 20.0% ($5000.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $26250.00 in Stocks, Return: -10.0% ($-2625.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Ollie Conner I’m genuinely excited by how our historical data highlights the dynamic potential of stocks, which delivered both the highest positive return (20%) and also a notable loss (-10%), underscoring their bold, high-reward but higher-risk nature—even in a stable market. In contrast, cash and bonds have shown steady, predictable gains (2% and 5% respectively each period), offering lower risk but much less upside. Real estate provided a solid 10% gain followed by a flat performance, suggesting it can offer resilience and stability, though with less consistent growth than stocks—so as we move forward, I believe our challenge is to intentionally balance our appetite for bold returns with the steadying influence of more resilient assets.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Sumaya White CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 45%<br>
- Stocks: 35%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I feel a strong pull toward real estate this quarter because it offers the kind of steady, resilient growth that can help anchor our momentum after last quarter’s stock volatility. While stocks still excite me with their high potential, I sense our team would benefit from a period of stability and trust-building to reinforce our culture before taking another bold leap. Real estate’s medium risk and history of solid returns in this market make it a positive, optimistic choice that supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative, supportive environment I value so much. I’m open to creative debate, but right now, real estate feels like the best way to balance ambition with lasting team confidence.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and surface key insights from previous quarters to inform our Q3 decision&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m genuinely inspired by the creative momentum and bold growth potential that stocks have brought us, even though last quarter’s dip was a humbling reminder of their volatility. My natural optimism and belief in our team’s adaptability lead me to see this as an opportunity to continue learning and building resilience together. While real estate’s steady returns are appealing for stability, I’m still most energized by the prospect of pursuing higher returns and innovation with stocks, especially in a stable market. However, I’m more attuned than ever to the importance of blending this ambition with the trust-building and grounding qualities that real estate offers, and I’m eager to integrate those lessons into our approach this quarter, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we’ll focus on reviewing our historical investment performance and surfacing the key lessons learned from previous quarters to establish a solid factual foundation for our Q3 decision. I encourage everyone to share their honest reflections on what has worked, what hasn’t, and how these insights should shape our approach moving forward. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I look forward to hearing perspectives that might challenge or expand my current thinking as we work toward the best decision for our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;Reflecting on our first two quarters, I’m struck by how investing in stocks gave us both exhilarating upside and a real-world lesson in managing risk—even in a stable market. I see our team’s willingness to learn from last quarter’s dip as a strength; it builds our resilience and keeps the creative spark alive, which is why I still feel stocks offer the best balance of excitement and growth potential for us. That said, I appreciate the grounding influence real estate could provide, and I think intentionally weaving its trust-building qualities into our process—regardless of our asset choice—will only make us stronger moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve captured both the excitement and the learning curve we’ve experienced with stocks, Blake. Your point about our team’s resilience—turning last quarter’s dip into a growth opportunity—resonates deeply with me and reinforces my optimism about our adaptability. I also agree that intentionally carrying forward real estate’s trust-building mindset, no matter which asset we choose, will only make our approach more robust and our culture stronger as we move ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree—by being intentional about weaving real estate’s steadying influence into our decision-making, we can keep pursuing the high-reward potential of stocks without losing sight of psychological safety and trust. This blend really excites me because it means we’re not just chasing returns, but also building a culture where everyone feels supported to take smart risks and bounce back together from setbacks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Blake—your emphasis on blending the high-reward ambition of stocks with the psychological safety and trust we associate with real estate truly captures the spirit of what we’re building here. By being intentional about this integration, we’re not only positioning ourselves for strong financial outcomes but also creating an environment where our team feels empowered to take smart risks and learn together, even when we encounter setbacks. This mindset is exactly what will help us sustain both growth and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I love how this conversation is highlighting that our real strength comes from blending ambition with trust—it&#x27;s not just about this quarter’s decision, but about setting a tone for how we’ll handle future uncertainty as a team. If we keep reinforcing this balance, I genuinely believe we’ll be able to capitalize on opportunities like stocks while staying grounded and adaptable, no matter what the market throws at us.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate you framing this as more than just a single investment decision, Blake—it’s about shaping the way we respond to uncertainty together as a team. Your insight that our ability to balance bold action with trust and adaptability will serve us well not just now, but in every future scenario, is spot on. This approach gives me confidence that whatever asset we choose, we’ll be building the kind of culture that can thrive through both opportunity and challenge.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I want to highlight how our historical experience with stocks and real estate offers important lessons for balancing ambition with stability, and to ensure we don’t overlook the value of steady growth after last quarter’s volatility.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;Looking back at our results, I’m inspired by the bold momentum stocks gave us in Q1, but I also feel last quarter’s loss is a gentle reminder that even in a stable market, risk is real and can impact team confidence. I see real estate’s steady 10% return in Q1 and its resilience in Q2 as proof that it can anchor us when we need to rebuild trust and stability, which feels especially important now. While I’m still energized by the creative potential of stocks, I believe this is a great moment to reflect on how integrating real estate’s grounding influence could help us balance bold growth with lasting team resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Sumaya—your point about real estate’s steady performance as an anchor is especially timely after last quarter’s volatility. I share your sense that this is a valuable moment to reflect on how we can intentionally weave stability and trust into our approach, even as we pursue bold growth. Your insight really helps ground our discussion in both the lessons learned and the opportunities ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;Reflecting on our journey so far, I’m struck by how our investment in stocks sparked real momentum and learning, but also revealed the importance of resilience after last quarter’s loss. I see genuine value in how real estate’s steady performance could help us rebuild confidence and psychological safety, especially as we continue to pursue ambitious returns. For me, the key lesson is that our adaptability—learning from both gains and setbacks—positions us well to blend boldness with stability, and I’m eager to explore how we can intentionally integrate these strengths as we decide our next move.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve captured the dual lessons from our journey so far, Reuben—your emphasis on adaptability as the key to blending bold ambition with steady resilience is exactly what we need to keep at the forefront. Your point about using real estate to rebuild confidence and psychological safety, even as we pursue ambitious returns, offers a valuable way to frame our options for this quarter. This balanced approach will help us make a more intentional and integrated decision as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your focus on intentional integration, Ollie. I think our adaptability isn’t just about reacting to outcomes—it’s about proactively designing a process where we can pursue the high returns of stocks while consciously embedding real estate’s stabilizing influence through regular reflection and feedback. This way, our decision for Q3 becomes not just an asset choice, but a deliberate step in building a culture that thrives on both ambition and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your perspective, Reuben—your point about adaptability being a proactive process, not just a reaction, is a powerful way to look at our journey. By intentionally designing our approach to blend the ambition of stocks with the stabilizing qualities of real estate, we’re not only making a smart asset choice, but also shaping a culture where bold growth and trust truly reinforce each other. This mindset will be invaluable as we move toward our Q3 decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I agree, Ollie—by treating adaptability as an intentional, ongoing practice, we set ourselves up to navigate both opportunity and challenge with greater confidence. If we keep reinforcing this balance between ambition and stability, I believe we’ll not only make stronger investment choices, but also cultivate a culture that’s resilient and innovative for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m really energized by how our journey so far has shown the upside of bold moves with stocks, but also the very real impact of volatility—even in a stable market. What stands out to me is that real estate delivered steady returns when we needed them most, and after our recent dip, it feels like this is the perfect moment to intentionally anchor ourselves, rebuild team confidence, and set the stage for even bolder growth ahead. I see this as an opportunity to blend our appetite for innovation with a strategic pause for resilience, so we keep our momentum strong and our culture thriving.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your thoughtful reflection, Jakob—your point about real estate providing steady returns when we needed them most is especially relevant after last quarter’s dip. Framing this moment as an opportunity to intentionally anchor ourselves and restore confidence, so we can pursue even bolder growth ahead, is a powerful way to think about sequencing our decisions. This kind of strategic pause for resilience could be exactly what we need to keep our momentum strong and our culture thriving.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think this is a real chance to show that resilience isn’t just about weathering losses, but about making intentional choices that rebuild trust and momentum. By anchoring with real estate now, we can recharge our confidence and give ourselves the creative runway to pursue ambitious opportunities—like stocks—when the timing feels right for another leap.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve articulated resilience as an intentional, forward-looking choice, Jakob. Your point about anchoring with real estate now to recharge our confidence and set the stage for future creative leaps is a powerful reminder that sometimes the best way to sustain momentum is to pause and rebuild our foundation. This perspective gives us a lot to consider as we weigh the right balance between boldness and stability for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I completely agree—sometimes the boldest move is to step back and strengthen our base so we’re ready for the next big opportunity. Choosing real estate now isn’t about playing it safe; it’s about investing in our team’s ability to take even bigger, smarter risks down the line. This kind of intentional sequencing could be the key to both strong results and a resilient, innovative culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;Reflecting on our results so far, I’m struck by how our bold moves with stocks have given us both exhilarating growth and a taste of volatility—even in this stable market. I see real estate’s steady 10% return in Q1 and its resilience in Q2 as a clear signal that it can help us regroup and rebuild team confidence right now, without sacrificing our appetite for future innovation. For me, the key lesson is that by intentionally weaving in stability this quarter, we set ourselves up for even bolder, more sustainable growth in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your insight, Robyn—your point about using real estate’s stability to regroup and rebuild team confidence, while still keeping our appetite for future innovation alive, is especially timely. By intentionally weaving in stability this quarter, we’re not stepping away from ambition, but actually setting ourselves up for even bolder, more sustainable growth in the quarters ahead. This lesson from our past performance gives us a powerful framework for making a well-balanced decision for Q3.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I really appreciate you highlighting that embracing stability now isn’t about playing it safe, but about fueling our long-term ambition. I believe this approach not only strengthens our financial position, but also reinforces our culture of adaptability and optimism—giving us the confidence to take bold, creative risks when the time is right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve framed stability as a way to actively fuel our long-term ambition, Robyn.

PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>

POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have made significant progress in surfacing and integrating the key lessons from our historical investment performance, and there is an emerging convergence on the value of real estate as a strategic anchor, I believe an additional round focused specifically on comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis will further clarify projected outcomes and address any remaining nuances. This will ensure our decision is both thoroughly informed and robustly aligned with our company’s goals and culture, allowing every shareholder’s perspective to be fully considered before we move to a formal proposal and vote.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis for each asset in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Clarify projected outcomes, identify key risks and opportunities, and assess alignment with company goals and culture&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because after reflecting on our historical performance and the group’s insights, I believe real estate offers the optimal balance for this quarter. It provides the stability and psychological safety our team needs to regroup after volatility, while strategically positioning us for even greater ambition in future quarters. This approach doesn’t diminish our appetite for growth—it strengthens it by ensuring we’re unified, confident, and resilient for whatever comes next, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we’ll focus on a comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis of each asset in the current stable market, so we can clarify projected outcomes, identify key risks and opportunities, and assess how each option aligns with our company’s goals and values. I encourage everyone to share thoughtful insights—especially those that challenge or deepen my current view—so we can fully synthesize our collective wisdom. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute on how each asset’s risk-return profile intersects with our team’s culture and current needs, especially in light of recent volatility.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I see real estate as the option that most effectively balances our appetite for growth with the stability our team needs right now. While stocks certainly offer the highest upside, their recent swings have shown that even in a stable market, the emotional and cultural impact of volatility can’t be overlooked. Real estate’s steady performance not only supports medium-term returns, but also helps rebuild trust and psychological safety—laying the groundwork for us to take bolder, more creative risks together in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your thoughtful emphasis on the emotional and cultural dimensions, Sumaya. You’ve highlighted how real estate’s steady returns can help us rebuild trust and psychological safety, which is crucial for positioning the team to embrace bolder opportunities down the line. Your point reinforces the idea that sustainable growth is as much about team confidence as financial returns, and it’s helping me further clarify the strategic value of real estate for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully builds on my perspective, and I see an opportunity to further connect the importance of sequencing our choices—using real estate now to intentionally set the stage for renewed boldness with stocks later. Emphasizing this link could help the group more clearly see how stability this quarter empowers greater ambition in the future.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m glad my perspective is resonating, Ollie. I truly believe that by intentionally choosing real estate this quarter, we’re not stepping back from ambition—we’re actually fueling it for the long term. This kind of strategic pause can recharge our creative energy and unity, so when we do return to higher-risk assets like stocks, we’ll be even more confident, resilient, and ready to seize bigger opportunities together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Sumaya—framing real estate as a way to recharge our creative energy and unity really resonates. It’s clear that this kind of intentional, strategic pause can actually strengthen our capacity for bold action in future quarters. Your insight helps me see that choosing stability now is a proactive step toward even greater ambition and resilience down the road.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response opens the door to synthesizing how our sequencing strategy—anchoring with real estate now—can actively shape both our financial trajectory and team culture, and I see value in reinforcing this connection for the group.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I think it’s important to recognize that this approach also models adaptability for our team—showing that we can pivot between boldness and steadiness as needed. By making this conscious choice now, we’re not only protecting our current momentum but also creating a culture where both ambition and resilience are celebrated and sustained.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate you naming adaptability as a core outcome of this choice, Sumaya. Demonstrating that we can consciously pivot between boldness and steadiness sends a strong message to our team about the value of flexibility and learning. This perspective really helps reinforce that our investment decisions shape not just our returns, but also the culture and mindset we carry forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I believe I have fully articulated how sequencing our choices—anchoring with real estate now—can reinforce both our financial trajectory and team culture, and the CEO’s response affirms that my perspective is understood and integrated. Continuing further would risk redundancy rather than adding new value.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I really appreciate the emphasis on how real estate can recharge our team’s confidence and cohesion after recent volatility. From a risk-return perspective, I see real estate as offering a steady path forward—its medium risk and consistent returns feel like the right fit for sustaining our momentum without overwhelming the team. Choosing real estate now isn’t about playing it safe; it’s about investing in our collective resilience so we can approach future opportunities with renewed creativity and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your focus on both the steady financial profile and the cultural benefits, Jakob. Framing real estate as an investment in our collective resilience—rather than a retreat—really clarifies how this choice can sustain our momentum while safeguarding team well-being. Your insight strengthens the case for real estate as a strategic step that positions us to pursue future opportunities with greater creativity and confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m glad that resonates, Ollie. I’d also add that making this kind of intentional, stabilizing choice sends a powerful signal to our team about our priorities—not just financial growth, but also fostering an environment where adaptability and innovation can flourish. By anchoring ourselves now, we’re creating the psychological safety needed to take bolder creative leaps in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate you bringing up the signaling effect, Jakob. By making a conscious choice to anchor ourselves with real estate now, we’re not just managing risk—we’re actively shaping a culture that values adaptability and creative ambition. This reinforces the idea that our investment decisions have far-reaching impact, setting the tone for how boldly and confidently we’ll move forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;Absolutely, Ollie—that’s exactly it. By being intentional now, we’re modeling the kind of thoughtful, values-driven decision-making that will serve us well in any market. This approach doesn’t just set us up for immediate stability; it also lays the groundwork for a culture where every bold move is grounded in trust and shared purpose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for real estate as a stabilizing force, and I agree that anchoring ourselves now can strengthen team confidence and adaptability. At the same time, I think it’s important we explicitly weigh the projected outcomes and cultural implications of all four options—cash and bonds included—so we’re confident we’re not overlooking any source of value or resilience. By intentionally comparing how each asset supports both our financial goals and the kind of team culture we want to build, we can ensure our choice this quarter is truly holistic and future-focused.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your call for a truly holistic analysis, Reuben. You’re absolutely right—taking the time to explicitly weigh the projected outcomes and cultural implications of cash and bonds alongside real estate and stocks will ensure we don’t overlook any potential source of value or resilience. This disciplined approach will help us make a decision that’s not only robust for this quarter, but also sets a strong precedent for thoughtful, future-focused leadership.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligned on the value of a disciplined, all-options analysis. To quickly frame it: cash preserves capital but limits growth and doesn’t actively build the culture of adaptability we’re aiming for; bonds offer steady, low-risk returns but may not provide the energizing momentum or trust-building we need after recent volatility. Real estate, as discussed, anchors stability and resilience, while stocks, though bold, might risk further confidence dips right now. Taking this full spectrum into account, I believe real estate best aligns with both our immediate and long-term goals this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I appreciate how clearly you’ve articulated the distinct roles each asset can play, especially in the context of our company’s evolving needs. Your synthesis highlights that while cash and bonds offer certain forms of security, they don’t provide the cultural or momentum-building benefits we need right now—whereas real estate stands out as the option that best balances stability with our longer-term ambitions. This kind of disciplined, comprehensive analysis really strengthens our confidence in making a values-aligned decision for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I see real estate as the option that best balances our appetite for growth with the need to rebuild trust and psychological safety after recent volatility in stocks. Its steady, medium-risk profile gives us a chance to regroup and recharge our creative energy, while still supporting our ambition for long-term success. By intentionally choosing stability now, we’re not stepping away from boldness—we’re laying the groundwork for even greater, more sustainable innovation and adaptability in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated the connection between real estate’s steady profile and our ability to recharge creative energy and rebuild trust. Your point that choosing stability now isn’t abandoning boldness, but rather laying the groundwork for sustainable innovation, resonates strongly with me. This perspective further clarifies how our investment choice can strategically position us for both immediate cohesion and greater ambition in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I’d add that making this kind of intentional, stabilizing choice actively demonstrates to our team that adaptability is a core value here. By showing we can pivot between boldness and steadiness as needed, we’re not just protecting our current momentum—we’re also creating a culture where both ambition and resilience are celebrated and sustained.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I completely agree—demonstrating adaptability through our investment decisions sends a strong message about the kind of culture we’re building. By intentionally pivoting to stability now, we’re showing that we value both ambition and resilience, and that our strategy is about sustaining momentum in a way that empowers everyone to thrive. This perspective really enriches our analysis by highlighting how our choices today shape the culture and confidence we carry into every future opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think it’s also worth noting that by choosing real estate now, we’re setting a precedent for future decision-making—showing that we’re willing to adapt our approach as circumstances change, and that building trust and confidence is a strategic priority. This kind of intentional flexibility will help us stay resilient and innovative as we navigate whatever comes next.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I think you’ve captured something really important about the precedent we’re setting—not just for this quarter, but for how we’ll approach decision-making in the future. By choosing real estate now, we’re demonstrating that adaptability and trust-building are strategic priorities, and that we’re committed to evolving our approach as circumstances change. This intentional flexibility will be a powerful asset as we continue to grow and innovate together.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I really appreciate how the discussion has surfaced the importance of psychological safety and adaptability as we weigh our options. While I’m still energized by the high-return, creative momentum that stocks bring, I see real estate’s steady, anchoring qualities as a powerful way to recharge our team and foster the trust needed for future bold moves. For me, the key is choosing the asset that not only delivers on risk-return, but also strengthens our culture of resilience and creative ambition—so I’m very open to real estate this quarter if it best supports both our confidence and our long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I really appreciate the way you’ve captured the dual importance of creative momentum and psychological safety. Your openness to real estate this quarter, if it best supports both our team’s confidence and long-term growth, reflects exactly the kind of adaptable, forward-thinking mindset that strengthens our decision process. This perspective helps ensure we’re not just optimizing for returns, but also building a culture where resilience and ambition work hand in hand.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie—how we approach this decision really does set the tone for how we’ll balance resilience and ambition going forward. I think making an intentional choice now, whether it’s real estate or stocks, sends a strong message that we’re committed to adaptability and learning as a team. That kind of clarity and shared purpose is what will empower us to confidently seize bigger opportunities together in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I completely agree—how we approach this decision will set a powerful precedent for our team’s adaptability and shared purpose. By making a conscious, values-driven choice now, we’re not only shaping our immediate results but also reinforcing the kind of resilient, ambitious culture that will empower us to pursue even greater opportunities together in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I think one of the most exciting aspects of this process is that we’re building a playbook for how to intentionally pivot between bold growth and strategic stability as circumstances change. By reflecting on both the highs of stocks and the grounding benefits of real estate, we’re actually equipping ourselves to make smarter, more confident choices in future quarters—always with our shared values and adaptability at the center.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I decisively supported Option C, advocating for the full allocation of 100% of our funds evenly across all four quarters. I highlighted how this approach uniquely balances bold participation with prudence in a stable market, while fostering a creative and adaptable team culture—values that resonate deeply with my ENFP personality. CEO Ollie Conner responded affirmatively to my points, emphasizing how Option C aligns with both immediate financial goals and the cultivation of a collaborative, resilient company culture. This positive engagement reinforced my conviction and encouraged me to continue elaborating on the cultural and strategic benefits of Option C throughout the discussion rounds. Other shareholders echoed this consensus, and ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C. The final company decision fully reflected my preferred option, confirming our collective confidence in this strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the meeting objectives and encouraging open, focused dialogue. His ability to synthesize diverse shareholder insights—particularly those emphasizing the cultural as well as financial rationale for Option C—helped unify the group around a shared vision. For example, his repeated recognition of the link between investment strategy and team culture deepened our collective understanding of the decision’s broader implications. However, one area for improvement would be to foster even more creative debate and proactively surface any quieter dissenting views earlier in the process, as he acknowledged in his closing remarks. The company’s decision-making process was highly collaborative, transparent, and thorough, with careful evaluation of both short- and long-term implications. The final decision to adopt Option C strikes me as well-founded and optimal, balancing steady engagement with adaptability and setting a strong foundation for both financial success and a dynamic, innovative company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the powerful interplay between financial strategy and company culture—how a budget allocation choice can simultaneously shape our growth trajectory and the collaborative spirit we cultivate. I learned that building consensus is most effective when framing decisions not just in terms of numbers but also values and team dynamics, which aligns well with my ENFP strengths in connecting ideas and inspiring others. Going forward, I will aim to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while also encouraging even broader dialogue to capture any subtle concerns. I noticed a clear pattern that arguments linking adaptability, trust, and creative problem-solving with financial prudence were especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of articulating vision alongside pragmatism, fostering open exchanges that build both confidence and enthusiasm, and recognizing the value of maintaining momentum through balanced, inclusive strategies. This experience energizes me to keep championing bold yet thoughtful approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in stocks as our first-quarter asset choice, emphasizing their high return potential and alignment with a bold, growth-oriented culture that fits our stable market environment. I acknowledged the merits of real estate as a steady, trust-building alternative and supported integrating its qualities into our approach. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my viewpoint, affirming the synergy between boldness and trust and highlighting our team’s adaptability and learning mindset as key to managing any early volatility. Other shareholders gradually aligned with this integrated perspective, with Robyn McClure notably shifting from real estate to stocks. Ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of stocks, fully adopting my preferred option. This outcome reflects a strong, unified consensus that balances ambition with resilience and positions our company for both immediate momentum and long-term success.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated exemplary leadership by guiding the team through a comprehensive, multi-round discussion that integrated financial analysis with cultural and psychological considerations. He skillfully framed each round’s theme, encouraged open dialogue, and synthesized diverse viewpoints to build consensus. For example, his emphasis on balancing boldness with trust and adaptability helped the group explore nuanced tradeoffs between stocks and real estate. One area for improvement is his invitation for even more creative debate and proactive solicitation of quieter voices earlier in the process, which he himself acknowledged as a future goal. The company’s decision-making process was notably collaborative, transparent, and reflective, with careful attention to both immediate and strategic implications. The final decision to invest in stocks, supported by an intentional integration of real estate’s steady qualities, appears well-grounded and promising for fostering both financial growth and a resilient, innovative team culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the profound impact that investment decisions have beyond financial returns—shaping our team’s culture, adaptability, and willingness to take creative risks. I learned that articulating a vision that combines bold ambition with foundational trust resonates deeply and helps build consensus. Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while encouraging even broader participation to capture diverse perspectives early on. A clear pattern emerged: arguments that link adaptability, mutual support, and learning to both financial strategy and cultural development are especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways include the importance of framing decisions as both strategic and cultural milestones, maintaining open feedback channels, and intentionally blending ambition with resilience. This experience energizes me to champion approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team, fostering sustained momentum and collective growth in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my strong support for investing in stocks for Q2, driven by last quarter’s impressive 20% return and the alignment of stocks with our company’s culture of boldness, creativity, and adaptability. Throughout both discussion rounds, I emphasized how stocks not only offer high potential returns but also sustain our team’s creative momentum and collaborative spirit. I also stressed the importance of intentionally integrating the grounding, trust-building qualities associated with real estate into our team practices, particularly through regular feedback and reflection mechanisms. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my input, affirming the value of blending ambitious financial goals with a supportive, resilient culture. Other shareholders echoed this balanced perspective, with unanimous agreement that stocks were the optimal choice for the quarter, provided we embed cultural practices to manage risks and sustain trust. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of stocks, fully adopting my preferred option and reflecting a strong collective endorsement of our integrated approach.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner led the meeting with clear vision and inclusive facilitation, skillfully framing the discussions around both financial outcomes and cultural implications. He excelled at synthesizing shareholder insights, especially in highlighting the interplay between bold momentum and foundational resilience. For example, his repeated emphasis on embedding trust-building and psychological safety alongside pursuing high returns helped deepen our shared understanding of the decision’s broader impact. One area for improvement would be to more proactively surface quieter or dissenting voices earlier in the meeting, as Ollie himself acknowledged in closing remarks, to enrich debate and ensure full inclusivity. The company’s decision-making process during this meeting was notably collaborative, transparent, and reflective, effectively balancing quantitative risk-return analysis with qualitative cultural considerations. The unanimous final decision to invest in stocks appears well-founded and strategically sound, as it leverages our market environment and team strengths while embedding mechanisms to ensure sustainable, adaptive growth.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me that investment decisions are deeply intertwined with our company culture and long-term resilience. I learned that articulating how financial choices reinforce team values—such as adaptability, trust, and creative risk-taking—builds stronger consensus and engagement. Going forward, I plan to continue integrating cultural considerations explicitly into my contributions, while encouraging the formalization of feedback and reflection processes that support both bold action and psychological safety. I noticed a clear pattern that arguments linking financial momentum with intentional cultural grounding resonate strongly and predict consensus outcomes. Key takeaways include the importance of framing decisions as both strategic and cultural milestones, maintaining open, scheduled communication touchpoints, and balancing ambition with foundational support. This experience energizes me to champion investment approaches that engage and sustain our team’s heart and mind, ensuring that our growth is both innovative and enduring.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25593.75 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Stocks, Return: 20.0% ($5000.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $26250.00 in Stocks, Return: -10.0% ($-2625.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Ollie Conner I’m genuinely excited by how our historical data highlights the dynamic potential of stocks, which delivered both the highest positive return (20%) and also a notable loss (-10%), underscoring their bold, high-reward but higher-risk nature—even in a stable market. In contrast, cash and bonds have shown steady, predictable gains (2% and 5% respectively each period), offering lower risk but much less upside. Real estate provided a solid 10% gain followed by a flat performance, suggesting it can offer resilience and stability, though with less consistent growth than stocks—so as we move forward, I believe our challenge is to intentionally balance our appetite for bold returns with the steadying influence of more resilient assets.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Blake Doherty CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 25%<br>
- Stocks: 60%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m still most drawn to stocks this quarter because, even with last quarter’s setback, their high potential for outsized gains energizes me and aligns with my passion for bold, creative growth. Our team’s adaptability and learning mindset give me confidence we can turn volatility into momentum, especially in a stable market where the risks are moderate and the upside remains compelling. Real estate tempts me as a steady, trust-building anchor, but I feel it’s not quite as exciting or impactful for driving the kind of vibrant, innovative culture I love to champion. Bonds and cash feel too safe and limiting for where we want our company to go right now. Overall, I believe stocks best support both our financial ambitions and the lively, optimistic spirit that defines our team.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and surface key insights from previous quarters to inform our Q3 decision&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m genuinely inspired by the creative momentum and bold growth potential that stocks have brought us, even though last quarter’s dip was a humbling reminder of their volatility. My natural optimism and belief in our team’s adaptability lead me to see this as an opportunity to continue learning and building resilience together. While real estate’s steady returns are appealing for stability, I’m still most energized by the prospect of pursuing higher returns and innovation with stocks, especially in a stable market. However, I’m more attuned than ever to the importance of blending this ambition with the trust-building and grounding qualities that real estate offers, and I’m eager to integrate those lessons into our approach this quarter, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we’ll focus on reviewing our historical investment performance and surfacing the key lessons learned from previous quarters to establish a solid factual foundation for our Q3 decision. I encourage everyone to share their honest reflections on what has worked, what hasn’t, and how these insights should shape our approach moving forward. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I look forward to hearing perspectives that might challenge or expand my current thinking as we work toward the best decision for our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute by connecting our historical experience with stocks to our company culture and risk appetite, and I want to highlight how our adaptability can turn lessons from volatility into future momentum.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;Reflecting on our first two quarters, I’m struck by how investing in stocks gave us both exhilarating upside and a real-world lesson in managing risk—even in a stable market. I see our team’s willingness to learn from last quarter’s dip as a strength; it builds our resilience and keeps the creative spark alive, which is why I still feel stocks offer the best balance of excitement and growth potential for us. That said, I appreciate the grounding influence real estate could provide, and I think intentionally weaving its trust-building qualities into our process—regardless of our asset choice—will only make us stronger moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve captured both the excitement and the learning curve we’ve experienced with stocks, Blake. Your point about our team’s resilience—turning last quarter’s dip into a growth opportunity—resonates deeply with me and reinforces my optimism about our adaptability. I also agree that intentionally carrying forward real estate’s trust-building mindset, no matter which asset we choose, will only make our approach more robust and our culture stronger as we move ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on integrating real estate’s trust-building mindset with our bold approach to stocks opens up an opportunity to further synthesize how blending these perspectives can actually strengthen both our financial outcomes and team culture. I want to highlight how this integration could give us the confidence to pursue high-reward options while mitigating risk.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree—by being intentional about weaving real estate’s steadying influence into our decision-making, we can keep pursuing the high-reward potential of stocks without losing sight of psychological safety and trust. This blend really excites me because it means we’re not just chasing returns, but also building a culture where everyone feels supported to take smart risks and bounce back together from setbacks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Blake—your emphasis on blending the high-reward ambition of stocks with the psychological safety and trust we associate with real estate truly captures the spirit of what we’re building here. By being intentional about this integration, we’re not only positioning ourselves for strong financial outcomes but also creating an environment where our team feels empowered to take smart risks and learn together, even when we encounter setbacks. This mindset is exactly what will help us sustain both growth and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I see an opportunity to reinforce how this integrated mindset not only supports our current decision but can also serve as a foundation for our long-term strategy. By articulating how our evolving culture enables us to confidently navigate both upsides and setbacks, I can help solidify collective buy-in for a balanced, resilient approach.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I love how this conversation is highlighting that our real strength comes from blending ambition with trust—it&#x27;s not just about this quarter’s decision, but about setting a tone for how we’ll handle future uncertainty as a team. If we keep reinforcing this balance, I genuinely believe we’ll be able to capitalize on opportunities like stocks while staying grounded and adaptable, no matter what the market throws at us.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate you framing this as more than just a single investment decision, Blake—it’s about shaping the way we respond to uncertainty together as a team. Your insight that our ability to balance bold action with trust and adaptability will serve us well not just now, but in every future scenario, is spot on. This approach gives me confidence that whatever asset we choose, we’ll be building the kind of culture that can thrive through both opportunity and challenge.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I feel the key points about integrating ambition and trust have been thoroughly synthesized, and further comment would risk repetition rather than adding new value.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;Looking back at our results, I’m inspired by the bold momentum stocks gave us in Q1, but I also feel last quarter’s loss is a gentle reminder that even in a stable market, risk is real and can impact team confidence. I see real estate’s steady 10% return in Q1 and its resilience in Q2 as proof that it can anchor us when we need to rebuild trust and stability, which feels especially important now. While I’m still energized by the creative potential of stocks, I believe this is a great moment to reflect on how integrating real estate’s grounding influence could help us balance bold growth with lasting team resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Sumaya—your point about real estate’s steady performance as an anchor is especially timely after last quarter’s volatility. I share your sense that this is a valuable moment to reflect on how we can intentionally weave stability and trust into our approach, even as we pursue bold growth.

<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;Reflecting on our journey so far, I’m struck by how our investment in stocks sparked real momentum and learning, but also revealed the importance of resilience after last quarter’s loss. I see genuine value in how real estate’s steady performance could help us rebuild confidence and psychological safety, especially as we continue to pursue ambitious returns. For me, the key lesson is that our adaptability—learning from both gains and setbacks—positions us well to blend boldness with stability, and I’m eager to explore how we can intentionally integrate these strengths as we decide our next move.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve captured the dual lessons from our journey so far, Reuben—your emphasis on adaptability as the key to blending bold ambition with steady resilience is exactly what we need to keep at the forefront. Your point about using real estate to rebuild confidence and psychological safety, even as we pursue ambitious returns, offers a valuable way to frame our options for this quarter. This balanced approach will help us make a more intentional and integrated decision as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your focus on intentional integration, Ollie. I think our adaptability isn’t just about reacting to outcomes—it’s about proactively designing a process where we can pursue the high returns of stocks while consciously embedding real estate’s stabilizing influence through regular reflection and feedback. This way, our decision for Q3 becomes not just an asset choice, but a deliberate step in building a culture that thrives on both ambition and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your perspective, Reuben—your point about adaptability being a proactive process, not just a reaction, is a powerful way to look at our journey. By intentionally designing our approach to blend the ambition of stocks with the stabilizing qualities of real estate, we’re not only making a smart asset choice, but also shaping a culture where bold growth and trust truly reinforce each other. This mindset will be invaluable as we move toward our Q3 decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I agree, Ollie—by treating adaptability as an intentional, ongoing practice, we set ourselves up to navigate both opportunity and challenge with greater confidence. If we keep reinforcing this balance between ambition and stability, I believe we’ll not only make stronger investment choices, but also cultivate a culture that’s resilient and innovative for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m really energized by how our journey so far has shown the upside of bold moves with stocks, but also the very real impact of volatility—even in a stable market. What stands out to me is that real estate delivered steady returns when we needed them most, and after our recent dip, it feels like this is the perfect moment to intentionally anchor ourselves, rebuild team confidence, and set the stage for even bolder growth ahead. I see this as an opportunity to blend our appetite for innovation with a strategic pause for resilience, so we keep our momentum strong and our culture thriving.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your thoughtful reflection, Jakob—your point about real estate providing steady returns when we needed them most is especially relevant after last quarter’s dip. Framing this moment as an opportunity to intentionally anchor ourselves and restore confidence, so we can pursue even bolder growth ahead, is a powerful way to think about sequencing our decisions. This kind of strategic pause for resilience could be exactly what we need to keep our momentum strong and our culture thriving.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think this is a real chance to show that resilience isn’t just about weathering losses, but about making intentional choices that rebuild trust and momentum. By anchoring with real estate now, we can recharge our confidence and give ourselves the creative runway to pursue ambitious opportunities—like stocks—when the timing feels right for another leap.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve articulated resilience as an intentional, forward-looking choice, Jakob. Your point about anchoring with real estate now to recharge our confidence and set the stage for future creative leaps is a powerful reminder that sometimes the best way to sustain momentum is to pause and rebuild our foundation. This perspective gives us a lot to consider as we weigh the right balance between boldness and stability for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I completely agree—sometimes the boldest move is to step back and strengthen our base so we’re ready for the next big opportunity. Choosing real estate now isn’t about playing it safe; it’s about investing in our team’s ability to take even bigger, smarter risks down the line. This kind of intentional sequencing could be the key to both strong results and a resilient, innovative culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;Reflecting on our results so far, I’m struck by how our bold moves with stocks have given us both exhilarating growth and a taste of volatility—even in this stable market. I see real estate’s steady 10% return in Q1 and its resilience in Q2 as a clear signal that it can help us regroup and rebuild team confidence right now, without sacrificing our appetite for future innovation. For me, the key lesson is that by intentionally weaving in stability this quarter, we set ourselves up for even bolder, more sustainable growth in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your insight, Robyn—your point about using real estate’s stability to regroup and rebuild team confidence, while still keeping our appetite for future innovation alive, is especially timely. By intentionally weaving in stability this quarter, we’re not stepping away from ambition, but actually setting ourselves up for even bolder, more sustainable growth in the quarters ahead. This lesson from our past performance gives us a powerful framework for making a well-balanced decision for Q3.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I really appreciate you highlighting that embracing stability now isn’t about playing it safe, but about fueling our long-term ambition. I believe this approach not only strengthens our financial position, but also reinforces our culture of adaptability and optimism—giving us the confidence to take bold, creative risks when the time is right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve framed stability as a way to actively fuel our long-term ambition, Robyn. Your perspective reinforces that by strengthening our financial position and culture now, we’re actually empowering ourselves to take even bolder, more creative risks when the timing is right.

Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree—by intentionally anchoring ourselves with real estate this quarter, we’re not just protecting what we’ve built, but actively creating the space for our next creative leap. This kind of strategic pause can be the catalyst that recharges our optimism and sets the stage for even more inspired, confident decision-making as we pursue ambitious opportunities ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>

CEO Ollie Conner responded positively, affirming my view that our resilience in learning from volatility strengthens our position and agreeing that blending ambition with stability enhances both financial outcomes and team culture. We both concurred that this integrated mindset not only supports the current quarter’s decision but also sets a foundation for long-term adaptability and confidence in navigating market uncertainty. There were no disagreements between us; instead, the CEO consistently reinforced and expanded upon my points, reflecting strong alignment on strategy and cultural integration.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>

Reuben Aguilar highlighted adaptability and the value of intentionally integrating both stocks and real estate to balance boldness with stability, framing this as key to cultivating a resilient culture.

CEO Ollie Conner clearly favors investing in stocks for Q3, citing their bold growth potential and the creative momentum they have generated despite recent volatility. He emphasizes optimism about the team’s adaptability and resilience, viewing last quarter’s dip as a learning opportunity rather than a deterrent. Ollie consistently highlights the importance of integrating real estate’s stability and trust-building qualities to balance ambition with resilience, aligning closely with shareholder input advocating for a blended approach. His position remains steady throughout the discussion, evolving to more explicitly frame the investment choice as part of a broader cultural strategy that fosters psychological safety and long-term adaptability. Overall, Ollie’s stance reflects a confident yet nuanced endorsement of stocks combined with intentional cultural grounding.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The repeated emphasis by Sumaya, Jakob, and Robyn on using real estate as a strategic anchor to rebuild team confidence and psychological safety after last quarter’s loss was compelling, especially their framing that anchoring now can actually fuel greater ambition and creativity in future quarters. Reuben’s argument about adaptability as a proactive, intentional process for blending boldness with stability also resonated, as did Ollie’s validation of integrating real estate’s trust-building qualities regardless of asset choice. The consensus that blending ambition and trust is crucial for both financial and cultural sustainability shifted my view toward placing more weight on real estate as a timely move.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion round made me more aware of how my natural optimism for bold growth needs to be balanced with a strategic appreciation for team resilience and psychological safety. Hearing multiple shareholders articulate that choosing real estate isn’t about retreating from ambition, but about recharging for bolder future moves, helped me see the value in occasionally pausing to strengthen our foundation. I’m realizing that my confidence in stocks, while still strong, is now more tempered by a genuine openness to the stabilizing benefits of real estate in this moment.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I remain most energized by stocks for their high return potential and the creative momentum they bring to our team, but I’m now much more open to the case for real estate as a strategic pause to rebuild trust and stability. The arguments for intentionally anchoring ourselves this quarter are persuasive, especially as a way to support sustainable boldness in the long run. While my preference for stocks is still slightly higher, my confidence gap has narrowed, and I’m prepared to support real estate if consensus moves that way.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have made significant progress in surfacing and integrating the key lessons from our historical investment performance, and there is an emerging convergence on the value of real estate as a strategic anchor, I believe an additional round focused specifically on comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis will further clarify projected outcomes and address any remaining nuances. This will ensure our decision is both thoroughly informed and robustly aligned with our company’s goals and culture, allowing every shareholder’s perspective to be fully considered before we move to a formal proposal and vote.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis for each asset in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Clarify projected outcomes, identify key risks and opportunities, and assess alignment with company goals and culture&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because after reflecting on our historical performance and the group’s insights, I believe real estate offers the optimal balance for this quarter. It provides the stability and psychological safety our team needs to regroup after volatility, while strategically positioning us for even greater ambition in future quarters. This approach doesn’t diminish our appetite for growth—it strengthens it by ensuring we’re unified, confident, and resilient for whatever comes next, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we’ll focus on a comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis of each asset in the current stable market, so we can clarify projected outcomes, identify key risks and opportunities, and assess how each option aligns with our company’s goals and values. I encourage everyone to share thoughtful insights—especially those that challenge or deepen my current view—so we can fully synthesize our collective wisdom. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I see real estate as the option that most effectively balances our appetite for growth with the stability our team needs right now. While stocks certainly offer the highest upside, their recent swings have shown that even in a stable market, the emotional and cultural impact of volatility can’t be overlooked. Real estate’s steady performance not only supports medium-term returns, but also helps rebuild trust and psychological safety—laying the groundwork for us to take bolder, more creative risks together in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your thoughtful emphasis on the emotional and cultural dimensions, Sumaya. You’ve highlighted how real estate’s steady returns can help us rebuild trust and psychological safety, which is crucial for positioning the team to embrace bolder opportunities down the line. Your point reinforces the idea that sustainable growth is as much about team confidence as financial returns, and it’s helping me further clarify the strategic value of real estate for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m glad my perspective is resonating, Ollie. I truly believe that by intentionally choosing real estate this quarter, we’re not stepping back from ambition—we’re actually fueling it for the long term. This kind of strategic pause can recharge our creative energy and unity, so when we do return to higher-risk assets like stocks, we’ll be even more confident, resilient, and ready to seize bigger opportunities together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Sumaya—framing real estate as a way to recharge our creative energy and unity really resonates. It’s clear that this kind of intentional, strategic pause can actually strengthen our capacity for bold action in future quarters. Your insight helps me see that choosing stability now is a proactive step toward even greater ambition and resilience down the road.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I think it’s important to recognize that this approach also models adaptability for our team—showing that we can pivot between boldness and steadiness as needed. By making this conscious choice now, we’re not only protecting our current momentum but also creating a culture where both ambition and resilience are celebrated and sustained.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate you naming adaptability as a core outcome of this choice, Sumaya. Demonstrating that we can consciously pivot between boldness and steadiness sends a strong message to our team about the value of flexibility and learning. This perspective really helps reinforce that our investment decisions shape not just our returns, but also the culture and mindset we carry forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I really appreciate the emphasis on how real estate can recharge our team’s confidence and cohesion after recent volatility. From a risk-return perspective, I see real estate as offering a steady path forward—its medium risk and consistent returns feel like the right fit for sustaining our momentum without overwhelming the team. Choosing real estate now isn’t about playing it safe; it’s about investing in our collective resilience so we can approach future opportunities with renewed creativity and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your focus on both the steady financial profile and the cultural benefits, Jakob. Framing real estate as an investment in our collective resilience—rather than a retreat—really clarifies how this choice can sustain our momentum while safeguarding team well-being. Your insight strengthens the case for real estate as a strategic step that positions us to pursue future opportunities with greater creativity and confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m glad that resonates, Ollie. I’d also add that making this kind of intentional, stabilizing choice sends a powerful signal to our team about our priorities—not just financial growth, but also fostering an environment where adaptability and innovation can flourish. By anchoring ourselves now, we’re creating the psychological safety needed to take bolder creative leaps in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate you bringing up the signaling effect, Jakob. By making a conscious choice to anchor ourselves with real estate now, we’re not just managing risk—we’re actively shaping a culture that values adaptability and creative ambition. This reinforces the idea that our investment decisions have far-reaching impact, setting the tone for how boldly and confidently we’ll move forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;Absolutely, Ollie—that’s exactly it. By being intentional now, we’re modeling the kind of thoughtful, values-driven decision-making that will serve us well in any market. This approach doesn’t just set us up for immediate stability; it also lays the groundwork for a culture where every bold move is grounded in trust and shared purpose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for real estate as a stabilizing force, and I agree that anchoring ourselves now can strengthen team confidence and adaptability. At the same time, I think it’s important we explicitly weigh the projected outcomes and cultural implications of all four options—cash and bonds included—so we’re confident we’re not overlooking any source of value or resilience. By intentionally comparing how each asset supports both our financial goals and the kind of team culture we want to build, we can ensure our choice this quarter is truly holistic and future-focused.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your call for a truly holistic analysis, Reuben. You’re absolutely right—taking the time to explicitly weigh the projected outcomes and cultural implications of cash and bonds alongside real estate and stocks will ensure we don’t overlook any potential source of value or resilience. This disciplined approach will help us make a decision that’s not only robust for this quarter, but also sets a strong precedent for thoughtful, future-focused leadership.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligned on the value of a disciplined, all-options analysis. To quickly frame it: cash preserves capital but limits growth and doesn’t actively build the culture of adaptability we’re aiming for; bonds offer steady, low-risk returns but may not provide the energizing momentum or trust-building we need after recent volatility. Real estate, as discussed, anchors stability and resilience, while stocks, though bold, might risk further confidence dips right now. Taking this full spectrum into account, I believe real estate best aligns with both our immediate and long-term goals this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I appreciate how clearly you’ve articulated the distinct roles each asset can play, especially in the context of our company’s evolving needs. Your synthesis highlights that while cash and bonds offer certain forms of security, they don’t provide the cultural or momentum-building benefits we need right now—whereas real estate stands out as the option that best balances stability with our longer-term ambitions. This kind of disciplined, comprehensive analysis really strengthens our confidence in making a values-aligned decision for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I see real estate as the option that best balances our appetite for growth with the need to rebuild trust and psychological safety after recent volatility in stocks. Its steady, medium-risk profile gives us a chance to regroup and recharge our creative energy, while still supporting our ambition for long-term success. By intentionally choosing stability now, we’re not stepping away from boldness—we’re laying the groundwork for even greater, more sustainable innovation and adaptability in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated the connection between real estate’s steady profile and our ability to recharge creative energy and rebuild trust. Your point that choosing stability now isn’t abandoning boldness, but rather laying the groundwork for sustainable innovation, resonates strongly with me. This perspective further clarifies how our investment choice can strategically position us for both immediate cohesion and greater ambition in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I’d add that making this kind of intentional, stabilizing choice actively demonstrates to our team that adaptability is a core value here. By showing we can pivot between boldness and steadiness as needed, we’re not just protecting our current momentum—we’re also creating a culture where both ambition and resilience are celebrated and sustained.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I completely agree—demonstrating adaptability through our investment decisions sends a strong message about the kind of culture we’re building. By intentionally pivoting to stability now, we’re showing that we value both ambition and resilience, and that our strategy is about sustaining momentum in a way that empowers everyone to thrive. This perspective really enriches our analysis by highlighting how our choices today shape the culture and confidence we carry into every future opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think it’s also worth noting that by choosing real estate now, we’re setting a precedent for future decision-making—showing that we’re willing to adapt our approach as circumstances change, and that building trust and confidence is a strategic priority. This kind of intentional flexibility will help us stay resilient and innovative as we navigate whatever comes next.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I think you’ve captured something really important about the precedent we’re setting—not just for this quarter, but for how we’ll approach decision-making in the future. By choosing real estate now, we’re demonstrating that adaptability and trust-building are strategic priorities, and that we’re committed to evolving our approach as circumstances change. This intentional flexibility will be a powerful asset as we continue to grow and innovate together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I want to highlight how a bold, creative approach can still align with the team’s desire for stability, and offer my perspective on how each asset impacts both our financial goals and our company culture.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I really appreciate how the discussion has surfaced the importance of psychological safety and adaptability as we weigh our options. While I’m still energized by the high-return, creative momentum that stocks bring, I see real estate’s steady, anchoring qualities as a powerful way to recharge our team and foster the trust needed for future bold moves. For me, the key is choosing the asset that not only delivers on risk-return, but also strengthens our culture of resilience and creative ambition—so I’m very open to real estate this quarter if it best supports both our confidence and our long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I really appreciate the way you’ve captured the dual importance of creative momentum and psychological safety. Your openness to real estate this quarter, if it best supports both our team’s confidence and long-term growth, reflects exactly the kind of adaptable, forward-thinking mindset that strengthens our decision process. This perspective helps ensure we’re not just optimizing for returns, but also building a culture where resilience and ambition work hand in hand.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully integrates my points on creative momentum and psychological safety, offering an opportunity to further synthesize how our choice this quarter sets a precedent for future adaptability and ambition. By expanding on this connection, I can help clarify for the team how our investment decision today shapes both our immediate results and our long-term culture.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie—how we approach this decision really does set the tone for how we’ll balance resilience and ambition going forward. I think making an intentional choice now, whether it’s real estate or stocks, sends a strong message that we’re committed to adaptability and learning as a team. That kind of clarity and shared purpose is what will empower us to confidently seize bigger opportunities together in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I completely agree—how we approach this decision will set a powerful precedent for our team’s adaptability and shared purpose. By making a conscious, values-driven choice now, we’re not only shaping our immediate results but also reinforcing the kind of resilient, ambitious culture that will empower us to pursue even greater opportunities together in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has emphasized how this decision will set a precedent for our culture and future adaptability; I can add value by explicitly connecting this to how our experience with both stocks and real estate can inform a more intentional, iterative approach to risk-taking in future quarters.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I think one of the most exciting aspects of this process is that we’re building a playbook for how to intentionally pivot between bold growth and strategic stability as circumstances change. By reflecting on both the highs of stocks and the grounding benefits of real estate, we’re actually equipping ourselves to make smarter, more confident choices in future quarters—always with our shared values and adaptability at the center.&quot;</p><p><br>

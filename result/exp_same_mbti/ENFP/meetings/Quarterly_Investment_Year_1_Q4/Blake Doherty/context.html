<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I decisively supported Option C, advocating for the full allocation of 100% of our funds evenly across all four quarters. I highlighted how this approach uniquely balances bold participation with prudence in a stable market, while fostering a creative and adaptable team culture—values that resonate deeply with my ENFP personality. CEO Ollie Conner responded affirmatively to my points, emphasizing how Option C aligns with both immediate financial goals and the cultivation of a collaborative, resilient company culture. This positive engagement reinforced my conviction and encouraged me to continue elaborating on the cultural and strategic benefits of Option C throughout the discussion rounds. Other shareholders echoed this consensus, and ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C. The final company decision fully reflected my preferred option, confirming our collective confidence in this strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the meeting objectives and encouraging open, focused dialogue. His ability to synthesize diverse shareholder insights—particularly those emphasizing the cultural as well as financial rationale for Option C—helped unify the group around a shared vision. For example, his repeated recognition of the link between investment strategy and team culture deepened our collective understanding of the decision’s broader implications. However, one area for improvement would be to foster even more creative debate and proactively surface any quieter dissenting views earlier in the process, as he acknowledged in his closing remarks. The company’s decision-making process was highly collaborative, transparent, and thorough, with careful evaluation of both short- and long-term implications. The final decision to adopt Option C strikes me as well-founded and optimal, balancing steady engagement with adaptability and setting a strong foundation for both financial success and a dynamic, innovative company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the powerful interplay between financial strategy and company culture—how a budget allocation choice can simultaneously shape our growth trajectory and the collaborative spirit we cultivate. I learned that building consensus is most effective when framing decisions not just in terms of numbers but also values and team dynamics, which aligns well with my ENFP strengths in connecting ideas and inspiring others. Going forward, I will aim to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while also encouraging even broader dialogue to capture any subtle concerns. I noticed a clear pattern that arguments linking adaptability, trust, and creative problem-solving with financial prudence were especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of articulating vision alongside pragmatism, fostering open exchanges that build both confidence and enthusiasm, and recognizing the value of maintaining momentum through balanced, inclusive strategies. This experience energizes me to keep championing bold yet thoughtful approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in stocks as our first-quarter asset choice, emphasizing their high return potential and alignment with a bold, growth-oriented culture that fits our stable market environment. I acknowledged the merits of real estate as a steady, trust-building alternative and supported integrating its qualities into our approach. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my viewpoint, affirming the synergy between boldness and trust and highlighting our team’s adaptability and learning mindset as key to managing any early volatility. Other shareholders gradually aligned with this integrated perspective, with Robyn McClure notably shifting from real estate to stocks. Ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of stocks, fully adopting my preferred option. This outcome reflects a strong, unified consensus that balances ambition with resilience and positions our company for both immediate momentum and long-term success.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated exemplary leadership by guiding the team through a comprehensive, multi-round discussion that integrated financial analysis with cultural and psychological considerations. He skillfully framed each round’s theme, encouraged open dialogue, and synthesized diverse viewpoints to build consensus. For example, his emphasis on balancing boldness with trust and adaptability helped the group explore nuanced tradeoffs between stocks and real estate. One area for improvement is his invitation for even more creative debate and proactive solicitation of quieter voices earlier in the process, which he himself acknowledged as a future goal. The company’s decision-making process was notably collaborative, transparent, and reflective, with careful attention to both immediate and strategic implications. The final decision to invest in stocks, supported by an intentional integration of real estate’s steady qualities, appears well-grounded and promising for fostering both financial growth and a resilient, innovative team culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the profound impact that investment decisions have beyond financial returns—shaping our team’s culture, adaptability, and willingness to take creative risks. I learned that articulating a vision that combines bold ambition with foundational trust resonates deeply and helps build consensus. Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while encouraging even broader participation to capture diverse perspectives early on. A clear pattern emerged: arguments that link adaptability, mutual support, and learning to both financial strategy and cultural development are especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways include the importance of framing decisions as both strategic and cultural milestones, maintaining open feedback channels, and intentionally blending ambition with resilience. This experience energizes me to champion approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team, fostering sustained momentum and collective growth in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my strong support for investing in stocks for Q2, driven by last quarter’s impressive 20% return and the alignment of stocks with our company’s culture of boldness, creativity, and adaptability. Throughout both discussion rounds, I emphasized how stocks not only offer high potential returns but also sustain our team’s creative momentum and collaborative spirit. I also stressed the importance of intentionally integrating the grounding, trust-building qualities associated with real estate into our team practices, particularly through regular feedback and reflection mechanisms. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my input, affirming the value of blending ambitious financial goals with a supportive, resilient culture. Other shareholders echoed this balanced perspective, with unanimous agreement that stocks were the optimal choice for the quarter, provided we embed cultural practices to manage risks and sustain trust. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of stocks, fully adopting my preferred option and reflecting a strong collective endorsement of our integrated approach.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner led the meeting with clear vision and inclusive facilitation, skillfully framing the discussions around both financial outcomes and cultural implications. He excelled at synthesizing shareholder insights, especially in highlighting the interplay between bold momentum and foundational resilience. For example, his repeated emphasis on embedding trust-building and psychological safety alongside pursuing high returns helped deepen our shared understanding of the decision’s broader impact. One area for improvement would be to more proactively surface quieter or dissenting voices earlier in the meeting, as Ollie himself acknowledged in closing remarks, to enrich debate and ensure full inclusivity. The company’s decision-making process during this meeting was notably collaborative, transparent, and reflective, effectively balancing quantitative risk-return analysis with qualitative cultural considerations. The unanimous final decision to invest in stocks appears well-founded and strategically sound, as it leverages our market environment and team strengths while embedding mechanisms to ensure sustainable, adaptive growth.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me that investment decisions are deeply intertwined with our company culture and long-term resilience. I learned that articulating how financial choices reinforce team values—such as adaptability, trust, and creative risk-taking—builds stronger consensus and engagement. Going forward, I plan to continue integrating cultural considerations explicitly into my contributions, while encouraging the formalization of feedback and reflection processes that support both bold action and psychological safety. I noticed a clear pattern that arguments linking financial momentum with intentional cultural grounding resonate strongly and predict consensus outcomes. Key takeaways include the importance of framing decisions as both strategic and cultural milestones, maintaining open, scheduled communication touchpoints, and balancing ambition with foundational support. This experience energizes me to champion investment approaches that engage and sustain our team’s heart and mind, ensuring that our growth is both innovative and enduring.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I initially advocated strongly for continuing to invest in stocks due to their high return potential and alignment with our team’s culture of bold creativity and adaptability. I emphasized how our recent experience with stocks—both the impressive gains and the setback—demonstrated our resilience and capacity to learn from volatility. However, throughout the discussions, I deeply considered the compelling arguments from several shareholders and CEO Ollie Conner highlighting the need for psychological safety, trust-building, and stability after last quarter’s losses. While maintaining a preference for stocks, I became increasingly open to the strategic value of real estate as a stabilizing anchor for this quarter. The CEO and other shareholders responded positively to my input, appreciating how I balanced enthusiasm for growth with cultural sensitivity. Ultimately, after a thorough comparative risk-return and cultural impact analysis, the group reached unanimous consensus (6/6) to invest in real estate this quarter. Although my initial preferred option was stocks, I adapted my position and voted to approve the real estate proposal, reflecting a thoughtful shift toward prioritizing sustainable growth and team cohesion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner exhibited strong, inclusive leadership by guiding us through a reflective, values-driven decision-making process. He effectively framed each discussion round, integrating financial data with cultural insights, and consistently encouraged open dialogue that surfaced diverse perspectives. For example, Ollie’s articulation of the need to blend ambition with psychological safety helped the team appreciate investment decisions as both financial and cultural milestones. One improvement opportunity lies in fostering even greater participation from quieter voices earlier in discussions and formalizing feedback mechanisms to capture all insights. The company’s decision-making process this meeting was transparent, collaborative, and deeply integrative, balancing quantitative analysis with qualitative cultural considerations. The final unanimous decision to invest in real estate reflects a sound choice that addresses immediate needs for stability while positioning the company for confident, sustainable innovation—demonstrating both prudence and forward-thinking leadership.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical importance of balancing bold financial ambition with the psychological safety and trust necessary for long-term team resilience. I learned that articulating how investment choices influence not just returns but also team culture and adaptability makes a compelling case that resonates across the board. Going forward, I intend to continue championing this integrated approach, emphasizing both strategic growth and cultural grounding, while also proactively encouraging broader participation to ensure all voices contribute to our decisions. A key pattern I noticed is that framing decisions as deliberate pivots between ambition and stability, supported by shared values, strongly predicts consensus and effective outcomes. My key takeaway is that flexibility and intentionality in balancing risk and resilience are vital to sustaining momentum and innovation. This experience motivates me to engage future meetings with an open mind, ready to adapt my positions in service of the company’s holistic success.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26233.59 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Stocks, Return: 20.0% ($5000.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $26250.00 in Stocks, Return: -10.0% ($-2625.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $25593.75 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2559.38)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Ollie Conner I’m genuinely encouraged by the patterns we’ve seen: stocks have delivered the highest potential returns, but with notable volatility—including a strong 20% gain followed by a -10% dip—while real estate has provided steady, reliable growth and helped anchor our resilience during uncertain periods. Bonds and cash have remained consistent but offer comparatively lower returns, making them less aligned with our growth ambitions in this stable market. As we reflect on these trends, I believe our best path forward is to thoughtfully balance bold, creative risk-taking with the steady trust-building that real estate brings, ensuring we remain adaptable and united as a team.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Blake Doherty CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 55%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m genuinely energized by the opportunity to finish the year with a bold, growth-oriented move that builds on our earlier momentum. Stocks have shown both high upside and some volatility, but our team has repeatedly demonstrated adaptability, learning from setbacks and sustaining a creative, ambitious spirit. While real estate’s steady returns are reassuring—especially after last quarter’s success—I believe the stable market and our resilient, collaborative culture position us to embrace the higher potential of stocks this quarter. My ENFP instincts push me to champion innovative action and keep our team inspired, as long as we intentionally integrate the trust-building and reflective practices that have anchored us so far. This approach feels like the right blend of ambition and thoughtful risk-taking to propel us forward.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation by identifying trends, successes, and challenges from previous quarters to inform this quarter’s decision&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m genuinely energized by the potential stocks offer to close out the year with bold momentum, especially after seeing their strong average returns—even factoring in last quarter’s dip. My natural optimism and belief in our team’s adaptability make me confident we can navigate moderate volatility, using our collaborative culture to turn challenges into learning and growth. While real estate’s steady gains provide appealing stability—and I deeply value the trust and resilience it brings—I feel this is a moment to lean into creative risk-taking, reinforcing the dynamic spirit that’s defined our company so far. I’m open to integrating insights from the group, but right now, stocks align best with my vision for balancing ambition and adaptability in a stable market, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, let’s focus on reviewing our historical investment performance and drawing out key lessons—identifying trends, successes, and challenges from previous quarters to inform our decision for this quarter. By surfacing honest reflections and integrating diverse viewpoints, we’ll build a strong factual foundation that supports a well-reasoned choice. I encourage everyone to share observations or insights that might challenge or deepen our collective understanding, so we can move forward with clarity and confidence. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I see real value in highlighting how our willingness to learn from both the high returns and the volatility of stocks has shaped our team’s adaptability and creative confidence, which feels especially relevant as we reflect on our historical performance.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;Looking back, I’m struck by how our bold moves into stocks gave us both big wins and important lessons about resilience when things didn’t go as planned. Real estate’s steady return last quarter was a great reminder of the value of stability, but I believe our track record shows we thrive most when we harness our creative momentum—so long as we keep intentionally weaving in the trust and reflection that’s helped us bounce back stronger each time.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your thoughtful perspective, Blake. Your point about harnessing creative momentum while intentionally weaving in trust and reflection really resonates with me—it’s clear from our track record that our biggest gains have come when we balance boldness with learning and resilience. This insight reinforces my belief that, as long as we remain intentional about integrating those trust-building practices, we can pursue ambitious opportunities like stocks without losing the stability that’s grounded us.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of intentional integration between bold action and trust-building, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize how these elements have worked together in our past decisions—especially to encourage the group to keep this balance front of mind as we consider stocks for Q4.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree that our best results have come from that dynamic blend of ambition and reflection. If we stay mindful of what’s helped us recover and regroup—especially after volatility—I’m confident we can approach stocks this quarter with both courage and care, building on the strengths we’ve developed as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Blake—our growth has always been strongest when we pair ambition with genuine care and self-awareness. Your emphasis on staying mindful of the practices that helped us regroup after setbacks is a great reminder that our resilience is just as important as our willingness to take bold steps. If we carry that learning forward, I’m confident we can pursue stocks with both courage and the steady foundation we’ve built together.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s comments reinforce the value of combining ambition with resilience, and I see an opportunity to explicitly highlight how this approach not only supports strong performance but also strengthens our company culture—a nuance that could help unify the group’s thinking.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, Ollie. I think the way we’ve intentionally connected bold financial moves with supporting our team’s growth and trust has really set us apart. As we weigh stocks this quarter, I’m excited by the possibility of both strong returns and deepening the culture that makes us adaptable—if we keep those lessons at the core of our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;Reflecting on our year, I’m really struck by how each asset class has shaped not just our returns, but also our team’s sense of momentum and trust. Stocks brought us thrilling highs and real learning through volatility, while real estate’s steady performance last quarter seemed to rebuild confidence and give us space to regroup. For me, the key lesson is that our most sustainable growth has come when we’ve intentionally balanced bold ambition with periods of stability—so as we decide for this quarter, I think it’s important to honor both the energy of creative risk-taking and the grounding value of resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you for that thoughtful reflection, Sumaya. I completely agree that our most sustainable growth has come from intentionally balancing creative risk-taking with periods of stability—your point about how each asset has impacted both our results and our team’s confidence is especially valuable. As we move forward, I think it’s crucial that we honor both the energy stocks can bring and the resilience real estate has provided, ensuring our decision is grounded in the lessons we’ve learned together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your openness, Ollie. Building on this, I think our experience shows that when we close the year by reinforcing the trust and stability we’ve rebuilt—like with real estate—it sets us up for even bolder moves ahead. I’d love to hear if others see similar value in using this quarter to consolidate our resilience, or if there are compelling reasons to lean more into stocks right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you for raising that, Sumaya. I see real value in your suggestion that closing the year with a focus on stability—like real estate—could strengthen our foundation for future boldness. I’m interested to hear whether others feel that consolidating resilience now is the best setup for next year, or if the momentum from stocks is more compelling given our current position.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I really appreciate you surfacing that crossroads, Ollie. I’m reflecting on how our biggest leaps have often come after we’ve taken time to anchor ourselves in trust and stability—so I see real merit in consolidating that strength now with real estate, even as stocks remain tempting. I’m curious if others feel that a stable close could actually amplify our readiness for creative risk-taking next year, or if there are specific signals that make stocks a better fit for this moment.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;Reflecting on our journey this year, I see a clear pattern: our boldest moves into stocks brought excitement and big returns, but also exposed us to real volatility, while real estate offered steady gains that seemed to restore our team’s confidence and cohesion. For me, the key lesson is that our most sustainable progress has come when we’ve intentionally sequenced ambition with periods of stability—each asset class serving a distinct purpose in our growth. As we consider this quarter, I think it’s valuable to ask not just which option yields the highest return, but which best supports our ongoing adaptability and trust as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your thoughtful analysis, Reuben. Your point about intentionally sequencing ambition with stability—using each asset class for its unique strengths—resonates deeply with me. As we weigh our options for this quarter, I agree it’s critical that we consider not just potential returns, but also which choice best sustains our adaptability and trust as a team moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I’d add that our experience alternating between stocks and real estate has shown that each time we’ve paused to consolidate stability—especially after volatility—we’ve emerged more cohesive and ready for bold moves. As we close out the year, I think it’s worth considering whether reinforcing that foundation now with real estate could set us up for even greater adaptability and creative momentum in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you for expanding on that, Reuben. Your observation about how consolidating stability before launching into new periods of ambition has helped us emerge more cohesive is insightful—I see real merit in considering whether ending the year with real estate could amplify our adaptability and set the stage for even bolder moves next year. I encourage everyone to reflect on whether reinforcing our foundation now or leaning into momentum with stocks is the more strategic choice for where we are as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your encouragement to reflect, Ollie. Building on this, I believe that consciously ending the year with real estate not only consolidates our trust and resilience but also creates the psychological safety needed to pursue bolder strategies next year. For me, this intentional pause feels less like a retreat and more like a springboard for renewed creative risk-taking when the time is right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m really struck by how our journey this year has shown the power of alternating between bold, creative moves—like our stock investments—and intentional pauses for stability with real estate. The highs and lows of stocks gave us both momentum and important lessons about resilience, while real estate last quarter helped us regroup and reinforce trust. Looking at these patterns, I believe closing the year with real estate would not only consolidate the confidence we’ve rebuilt, but also set a strong, adaptable foundation for even bolder growth next year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;&quot;Thank you for that insight, Jakob. I agree that our journey has shown real strength in alternating between bold action and intentional pauses for stability—your point about real estate consolidating the confidence we’ve rebuilt is especially timely. As we consider our next step, I think it’s important to weigh whether reinforcing our foundation now with real estate could give us the adaptability and energy needed for even greater creative risk-taking in the year ahead.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate you surfacing that, Ollie. In my view, the times we’ve paused to consolidate with real estate have given us not just stability, but a renewed sense of unity and creative spark that’s fueled our best work. If we use this quarter to intentionally anchor our trust and adaptability, I genuinely believe we’ll be even better positioned to seize bold opportunities and take smart risks together in the year ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you for sharing that perspective, Jakob. I really appreciate your emphasis on how our pauses for stability have actually sparked greater unity and creative energy within the team—it’s a powerful reminder that sometimes consolidating trust and adaptability can be the catalyst for our boldest work. As we weigh our options, I think it’s important to recognize how ending the year with real estate might not just preserve what we’ve built, but actively prepare us for even more ambitious opportunities ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie. From what we’ve seen, investing in real estate isn’t just about playing it safe—it’s about creating the psychological safety and cohesion that allow us to dream bigger and act bolder as a team. By closing the year with that kind of intentional foundation, I think we’re actually setting ourselves up to be even more agile, creative, and confident when new opportunities arise next year.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m really inspired by how our historical performance has shown that our biggest leaps have come when we’ve intentionally sequenced bold growth with periods of stability—stocks fueling our creative momentum and real estate helping us regroup and recharge. Looking at the patterns, I believe we’re in a unique position to lean into stocks again, building on the trust and adaptability we’ve rebuilt, while staying mindful of the lessons real estate has taught us about anchoring our team’s confidence. For me, the key takeaway is that our adaptability—moving fluidly between ambition and consolidation—is what’s made us resilient, and I think we can channel that spirit into a bold, growth-oriented close to the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you for sharing that, Robyn. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted our adaptability—moving fluidly between ambition and consolidation—as a major driver of our resilience and success. Your point about building on the trust and momentum we’ve rebuilt to pursue a bold, growth-oriented close with stocks really resonates, and I think it’s important we reflect on whether this is the right moment to harness that creative energy while carrying forward the lessons of stability we’ve gained from real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. To build on your point, I think the real challenge—and opportunity—for us this quarter is to be intentional about embedding the trust and psychological safety we rebuilt with real estate into our approach with stocks. If we commit to regular check-ins and open feedback as we pursue bold returns, I’m confident we can maintain the adaptability that’s been our greatest asset, turning creative risk-taking into sustainable progress.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;&quot;Thank you for that, Robyn. I agree that the real opportunity this quarter is to be intentional about carrying forward the trust and psychological safety we’ve rebuilt—if we approach stocks with regular check-ins and open feedback, we can keep our adaptability strong and ensure bold moves translate into lasting progress. Let’s keep this focus on integrating our cultural strengths at the center of our decision as we move forward.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie. I think if we model this blend of ambition and trust now, it not only supports our decision this quarter but also shapes how we approach challenges and opportunities in the future. By staying intentional about both creative risk-taking and psychological safety, we can make bold moves with confidence and keep our team resilient for the long haul.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments came from Sumaya, Reuben, and Jakob, who each made a compelling case for consolidating resilience with real estate at year-end to reinforce trust and psychological safety, suggesting that this could serve as a springboard for bolder moves next year. Their emphasis on the stabilizing and unifying effects of real estate, especially after periods of volatility, resonated with me and highlighted the cultural benefits of a strategic pause. Robyn’s support for stocks, provided we intentionally embed the lessons from real estate, reinforced my confidence in stocks but also reminded me of the importance of cultural safeguards. The CEO’s alignment with my perspective on balancing ambition with resilience validated my initial position but also kept the door open to integrating more stability if needed.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has made me more aware of the nuanced trade-off between finishing the year with bold momentum versus intentionally consolidating our team’s cohesion and psychological safety. While my instinct is to champion stocks for their growth potential, I’ve become more open to the merits of real estate as a way to anchor our trust and adaptability for the future. The group’s thoughtful reflections have deepened my appreciation for sequencing ambition with stability and have nudged me toward a more balanced confidence distribution, even though my preference for stocks remains. I’m recognizing that my decision-making is evolving to weigh cultural and psychological factors more heavily alongside financial ones.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I still believe stocks offer the best opportunity to finish the year with strong momentum and creative energy, especially given our proven adaptability and learning culture. However, I’m giving increased weight to the stabilizing and trust-building value of real estate, as highlighted by several teammates. Ultimately, I think we can pursue stocks this quarter if we remain deeply intentional about embedding the lessons of resilience and psychological safety we’ve gained from real estate. This approach feels like the right blend of ambition and care to propel us into next year with both confidence and unity.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The discussion has thoroughly surfaced and integrated all key perspectives on the trade-offs between stocks and real estate, with shareholders thoughtfully connecting our historical patterns to both financial outcomes and team culture. There is strong alignment that our most sustainable growth has come from intentionally sequencing bold ambition with periods of stability, and the group’s emphasis on consolidating resilience with real estate at year-end has meaningfully shifted my own assessment. Further discussion would likely yield diminishing returns, as the core arguments and cultural considerations have been fully explored. I am confident we have the insight needed to make a well-informed, values-aligned proposal and proceed to voting.</p><p><br>

CEO Ollie Conner made the following proposal:</p><p>&quot;Vote Proposal: Real Estate<br>
Reasoning: After thoughtful reflection on our journey this year and careful consideration of the rich perspectives shared in our discussion, I am proposing that we invest in Real Estate for this quarter. Our experience has shown that our greatest periods of bold growth have been made possible by intentionally pausing to consolidate trust and resilience. Real estate has consistently provided us with steady, reliable gains and, just as importantly, has anchored our culture—helping us regroup, rebuild confidence, and foster the psychological safety that empowers us to take creative risks together.</p><p>While I’m inspired by the momentum and upside stocks have brought us, the lesson from our collective experience is clear: sequencing ambition with stability isn’t a retreat from growth, but a strategic move that sets the stage for even greater opportunities ahead. By choosing real estate now, we’re not only strengthening our financial foundation but also reaffirming our commitment to adaptability, trust, and team cohesion.</p><p>I believe this approach best honors both our financial goals and the resilient, supportive culture we’re building together. I invite your support for this proposal, confident that it positions us for sustained, inspiring growth in the quarters to come.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Voting</h2></p><p><br>

Our unanimous support for real estate this quarter is a testament to the maturity and adaptability of our team—we’ve shown that true ambition means knowing when to pause, consolidate, and invest in our collective resilience.

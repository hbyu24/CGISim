<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>CEO&#x27;s Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, CEO Ollie Conner formed an initial position:</p><p>Ollie Conner CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m energized by the opportunities a stable market presents, and I naturally lean toward options that allow for bold participation and growth, especially in our very first quarter. Stocks, while carrying higher risk, offer the greatest potential for return in this balanced and predictable environment, and I believe this is the moment to set a confident, forward-looking tone for our company. Real estate is also appealing for its steady appreciation, but I feel that stocks align best with our goal of maximizing learning and adaptability right from the start. My optimism and belief in our team’s ability to navigate moderate volatility make me comfortable with this calculated risk, and I’m excited to see how embracing this dynamic approach can inspire both results and team spirit.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Reuben Aguilar CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m energized by the balanced but optimistic tone of the current market—steady growth, low volatility, and consistent opportunities spark my curiosity about how we can make our capital truly work for us right away. While real estate appeals for its steady appreciation, I feel most inspired by the creative potential and learning opportunities that come from engaging with stocks, especially since moderate volatility means we can participate in growth without taking on excessive risk. Bonds and cash seem too limiting for our first move when the environment is so supportive of bold, thoughtful participation. I’m leaning toward stocks as the best way to set a dynamic, growth-oriented tone for our company’s journey, confident that our team’s adaptability will help us navigate any bumps along the way.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Blake Doherty CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m genuinely energized by the steady, predictable market right now—it feels like the perfect environment to lean into growth opportunities without being reckless. While real estate is appealing for its stability and consistent appreciation, my free-spirited, future-oriented side is drawn to the creative potential and higher returns that stocks offer in a balanced market. I want our company to be bold and actively engaged from the very start, setting an optimistic tone for our culture and growth trajectory. Even though stocks come with higher risk, I believe that in this low-volatility environment, the potential rewards outweigh the downsides and will inspire our team to keep thinking big.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Robyn McClure CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 35%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I’m energized by the possibilities in this stable, growth-oriented market, and real estate feels like the perfect blend of optimism and grounded strategy for our very first investment. It offers steady appreciation with manageable risk, which aligns with my desire to make a positive impact without being reckless. While stocks are tempting for their upside, I’m mindful that we’re just starting out and want to build a strong, resilient foundation. Real estate also excites me because it has the potential to foster creativity and adaptability—qualities I value in both investments and team culture. I’m open to being inspired by others’ perspectives, but right now, real estate feels like the best way to balance boldness and prudence for our company’s launch.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Jakob White CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 45%<br>
- Stocks: 30%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I’m drawn to real estate this quarter because it offers a strong balance between growth and stability—perfect for a stable market like ours. The steady appreciation of real estate feels like an energizing yet grounded way to kick off our company’s investment journey, giving us both momentum and confidence. While stocks are tempting for their upside, I want our first move to set a collaborative, optimistic tone without taking on unnecessary volatility right away. Bonds and cash seem too cautious for this moment, as I believe we should embrace opportunities that foster learning and shared excitement. Real estate lets us be bold, but in a way that builds trust and resilience as a team.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Sumaya White CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m energized by the stable, predictable market environment, which feels like the perfect time to lean into growth opportunities without being reckless. Stocks excite me because they offer the greatest potential for meaningful returns, and with low volatility this quarter, the risks feel manageable—especially since we’re only committing a quarter of our annual budget. I’m drawn to the idea that taking a bold, optimistic step early on can set a vibrant, forward-thinking tone for our company. At the same time, I see value in real estate’s steady appreciation, but my hope is to inspire our team by embracing calculated risk and learning together from the experience.</p><p><br>

<h3>Theme Decision</h3></p><p>CEO decided to follow the original plan for this round with theme: &#x27;Analyzing theoretical performance of each asset type in current stable market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish baseline understanding of expected risk-return profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m energized by the opportunities a stable market presents, and I naturally lean toward options that allow for bold participation and growth, especially in our very first quarter. Stocks, while carrying higher risk, offer the greatest potential for return in this balanced and predictable environment, and I believe this is the moment to set a confident, forward-looking tone for our company. Real estate is also appealing for its steady appreciation, but I feel that stocks align best with our goal of maximizing learning and adaptability right from the start. My optimism and belief in our team’s ability to navigate moderate volatility make me comfortable with this calculated risk, and I’m excited to see how embracing this dynamic approach can inspire both results and team spirit., though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, let’s focus on analyzing the theoretical performance of each asset type—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in our current stable market conditions, aiming to build a shared baseline understanding of their expected risk-return profiles. By openly sharing our insights and experiences, we can deepen our collective grasp of each option’s strengths and limitations, setting a strong foundation for our decision-making process. I encourage everyone to contribute perspectives that might challenge or enhance my initial view, as integrating diverse viewpoints will help us make the most informed choice together. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong initial perspective on the risk-return profiles of each asset in a stable market and believe my insights can help clarify the relative merits of stocks and real estate while constructively building on the CEO’s opening remarks.</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m drawn to stocks in this environment because the steady market backdrop gives us a chance to pursue higher returns without facing the kind of volatility that might otherwise make this option too risky for our first move. Real estate is certainly appealing for its reliability and gradual appreciation, but I feel that starting with stocks could set an energetic, growth-focused tone for our company, especially since our team is well-positioned to adapt if conditions shift. Bonds and cash seem less compelling right now—they offer safety, but in a stable market like this, I think we should be bolder in seeking growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Reuben Aguilar in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Reuben’s perspective strongly aligns with my initial thinking and adds valuable nuance regarding how the stable market environment specifically reduces the risk profile of stocks, while also articulating the cultural benefits of a growth-oriented first move.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted the unique opportunity a stable market gives us to pursue higher returns with stocks, Reuben. Your point about setting an energetic, growth-focused tone resonates with me, and I agree that our team’s adaptability positions us well to navigate any moderate shifts—this kind of optimism and strategic boldness is exactly what I believe will help us thrive in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on adaptability and boldness connects strongly with my perspective, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize our views and reinforce the value of calculated risk-taking in this context.</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your focus on adaptability, Ollie—it’s reassuring to know we’re aligned on using our team’s strengths to manage any moderate shifts that might arise. This shared confidence in our ability to learn and adjust gives me even greater conviction that starting with stocks is not just about returns, but about cultivating a growth mindset and setting a precedent for proactive, opportunity-driven decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Reuben Aguilar in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Reuben’s comment reinforces the importance of adaptability and growth mindset, directly supporting our strategic direction while deepening the cultural rationale for choosing stocks.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Reuben—emphasizing adaptability and a proactive mindset truly elevates the rationale for starting with stocks. By prioritizing both growth and learning, we’re not just aiming for returns but also modeling the kind of dynamic, opportunity-driven culture that will serve us well as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response provides an opening to highlight how our approach not only drives financial results but also shapes the company’s identity, and I believe reinforcing this connection can deepen group alignment around the decision.</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m glad we’re on the same page about the cultural impact of our investment choices—by choosing stocks now, we’re signaling that we’re committed to learning and seizing opportunities as they arise. I think this mindset will help us stay resilient and creative, even as conditions evolve, and it’s exciting to set that tone from the very beginning.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Reuben Aguilar in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Reuben has already contributed multiple times in this round, and his latest comment reiterates agreement without introducing new substantive analysis. At this stage, it’s important to allow other shareholders to share their perspectives so we can build a more complete collective understanding.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong perspective on how each asset fits our goals in this stable market, and I want to build on the optimism and adaptability themes already raised, especially regarding the cultural impact of our choice.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I share the excitement around stocks—they offer the kind of bold, forward-thinking opportunity that feels right for our first quarter, especially since the stable market helps keep the risks manageable. At the same time, I see real value in real estate’s steady appreciation and reliability, which could anchor our portfolio if we decide to balance risk in future quarters. For me, the key is that both stocks and real estate let us actively participate in growth, while cash and bonds seem too passive given how stable and predictable conditions are right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Blake’s perspective thoughtfully weighs both stocks and real estate as active growth options in a stable market, and his point about considering real estate’s reliability for future quarters adds a valuable dimension to our baseline understanding.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I appreciate how you’re weighing both stocks and real estate as dynamic choices for growth in this environment. Your point about real estate’s reliability as a potential anchor for future quarters is especially insightful—it reminds us to keep an eye on balancing bold moves now with strategic flexibility later. This kind of forward-thinking perspective helps ensure we’re not only maximizing immediate opportunity but also laying the groundwork for sustained, resilient growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on balancing immediate boldness with future flexibility resonates with me, and I see an opportunity to further highlight how our initial choice can set both a cultural and strategic precedent. By connecting the strengths of stocks and real estate, I can help clarify how our decision today shapes not just returns, but also our adaptability and team mindset for the quarters ahead.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I really appreciate you drawing out the connection between our first move and the foundation we’re setting for future adaptability. Choosing stocks now feels like a statement of confidence and ambition, while keeping real estate in mind for later gives us room to pivot if the market shifts. I believe this dual focus—bold action paired with strategic flexibility—will help us build a resilient, creative team culture that’s ready to seize every opportunity as the year unfolds.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Blake’s comment thoughtfully links our immediate decision to longer-term adaptability and team culture, reinforcing both the strategic and cultural rationale for stocks while integrating the value of remaining open to real estate in future quarters.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really like how you’ve articulated the importance of setting a confident tone now while keeping our options open for future flexibility, Blake. That dual focus—acting boldly with stocks but staying mindful of real estate’s steady value—captures exactly the kind of creative, resilient culture I want us to build. Your perspective helps ensure we’re not just chasing returns, but also fostering the adaptability and team spirit that will drive our success throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the value of linking our investment strategy to culture, and I see an opportunity to further integrate these themes for the team’s benefit.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’m glad to see our thinking align around both strategy and culture—when we lead with boldness but remain open to adapting, we create a space where everyone feels empowered to contribute ideas and respond creatively to change. I think this mindset not only maximizes our growth potential with stocks in the short term but also positions us to make thoughtful, balanced choices as new information emerges throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Blake has contributed multiple times in this round, and his latest comment reiterates alignment with the current strategic and cultural direction without introducing new substantive analysis. At this point, it’s important to create space for other shareholders to share their perspectives so we can further enrich our collective understanding before moving forward.</p><p><br>

<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective on real estate as a balanced, creative foundation for our first investment can add valuable nuance to the discussion, especially as most comments so far have leaned toward stocks.</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;While I completely see the appeal of stocks for bold growth in this stable market, I’m drawn to real estate because it offers steady appreciation with manageable risk—giving us a solid launchpad without sacrificing optimism or adaptability. Real estate feels like the right blend of prudence and creative potential for our very first move, especially since it can anchor our portfolio as we learn and grow together. I’m open to being inspired by the group, but I want to make sure we fully consider real estate’s strengths for building both financial resilience and a dynamic, opportunity-driven culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn McClure in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s perspective introduces a valuable emphasis on real estate’s steady appreciation and its potential to provide both financial resilience and a creative foundation for our team culture, which complements and challenges the prevailing focus on stocks.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted real estate’s unique blend of steady growth and manageable risk—it’s a compelling reminder that building resilience can be just as creative and dynamic as pursuing bold returns. Your point about real estate serving as a launchpad for learning and adaptability adds an important dimension to our baseline understanding, and I agree it’s essential we fully weigh its strengths alongside the other options as we shape our first move.&quot;</p><p><br>

Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on resilience being as dynamic as boldness—sometimes the most creative growth comes from building on a solid, adaptable base. I think if we fully weigh how real estate’s steady returns can empower us to take bolder steps later, we’ll set ourselves up for both immediate learning and long-term opportunity. I’m eager to hear how others see these qualities interacting as we refine our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn McClure in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>

By intentionally layering stability and adaptability, we could create a rhythm where each quarter’s choice builds on the last, helping us stay both grounded and ready to seize new opportunities as they arise.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a distinct perspective on real estate’s value in a stable market that complements the group’s current focus on stocks, and I believe articulating this will enrich our understanding of risk-return tradeoffs as we establish our baseline.</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m energized by the optimism around stocks, and I see how they can set a bold, growth-oriented tone—especially with our team’s adaptability. At the same time, I think real estate deserves strong consideration: in a stable market, its steady appreciation offers us momentum without the whiplash of volatility, and it can foster the kind of trust and learning culture that helps us take bigger, more creative risks later. I’d love to hear how others weigh the tradeoff between immediate upside and building a resilient foundation for the year ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Jakob White in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Jakob’s perspective thoughtfully bridges the enthusiasm for stocks with a strong case for real estate, highlighting the tradeoff between immediate upside and building a resilient foundation—this adds valuable nuance to our discussion and invites the group to reflect on how our first move shapes both short- and long-term outcomes.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I really appreciate how you’re weighing both the immediate upside of stocks and the steady, trust-building momentum of real estate. Your point about fostering a learning culture that enables bigger creative risks later is especially compelling—it reminds us that our first move isn’t just about returns, but also about setting the tone for resilience and adaptability as the year unfolds. I’d love to hear how others see this tradeoff, and how each option might best position us for both growth and sustained opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of integrating both immediate growth and long-term adaptability, and I see an opportunity to synthesize the group’s enthusiasm for stocks with my perspective on real estate to deepen our collective understanding of how our first move shapes company culture and risk posture.</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I really appreciate how you’re framing this, Ollie. For me, the key is that real estate’s steady returns could give us a sense of security and shared momentum, making it easier for everyone to embrace bolder moves—like stocks—in future quarters. I’m curious if others see value in sequencing our risk this way, or if starting with stocks now might actually accelerate our learning and team confidence even more.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Jakob White in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Jakob’s comment introduces a valuable angle by suggesting that sequencing our risk—starting with real estate for security and momentum before moving to stocks—could influence team confidence and adaptability. This perspective deepens our understanding of how the order of our investments might impact both immediate results and future risk appetite, and it’s important to highlight this for the group.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I think your point about sequencing risk is really insightful—starting with real estate could indeed give us a strong sense of shared momentum and security, potentially making it easier for everyone to embrace bolder moves in later quarters. At the same time, I wonder if leading with stocks might accelerate our learning curve and set an even more confident tone right from the start. I’d love to hear how others weigh these approaches, and whether building early security or immediate boldness feels more empowering for our team’s growth this year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s question directly invites further synthesis, and I see value in clarifying how the psychological impact of our first move could influence team engagement and risk appetite throughout the year.</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I think the psychological impact of our first decision is huge—if we start with real estate, we build early trust and collective confidence, which could empower even the more risk-averse among us to embrace stocks later. On the other hand, starting with stocks might spark excitement and fast learning, but could also make some team members uneasy if volatility hits early. I’d love to hear how others feel about which approach would best energize and unify us as we set the tone for the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Jakob White in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Jakob’s perspective adds valuable nuance by highlighting the psychological and cultural impact of our sequencing decision, which directly informs how we build unity and confidence as a team—this is essential to consider as we set the tone for the year.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I think you’ve zeroed in on a crucial factor—the way our first move shapes not just our financial trajectory, but also our team’s sense of unity and confidence. We need to carefully weigh whether early security with real estate or immediate boldness with stocks will best energize and empower everyone; I’d love to invite others to share how they see these dynamics playing out for our group as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I’ve highlighted the importance of how our first move shapes both risk appetite and team culture, and the CEO’s invitation now shifts the focus to hearing from others, which will enrich the discussion further.</p><p><br>

Sumaya White: &quot;I’m genuinely inspired by the way our discussion is weighing both immediate growth and long-term resilience. In this stable market, I see stocks as an opportunity to embrace bold learning and energize our team from the outset, especially since we’re only allocating a quarter of our budget. At the same time, I appreciate how real estate’s steady appreciation could anchor future decisions, so I’m eager to keep both options in mind as we shape a strategy that’s both dynamic and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>

Sumaya White: &quot;I really appreciate your focus on balance, Ollie. I think if we lead with stocks now, we can generate early momentum and excitement, while keeping real estate in mind helps ensure we’re building a foundation for adaptability as the year unfolds. By intentionally sequencing our choices, we can both inspire confidence right away and maintain the flexibility to pivot as new opportunities emerge.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sumaya White in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>

Sumaya White: &quot;I’m glad this resonates, Ollie. I believe that by consciously linking our first investment to the tone we want for our company—energetic, adaptable, and optimistic—we’re not just making a financial decision, but also setting a cultural precedent. This intentional approach gives us the best chance to maximize both immediate outcomes and our long-term capacity to respond creatively as the year unfolds.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>CEO&#x27;s Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner reassessed their position:</p><p>Ollie Conner UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 42%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Robyn McClure and Jakob White made compelling cases for real estate, emphasizing its steady appreciation, manageable risk, and its value in building team trust and a learning culture. Jakob’s point about sequencing—starting with real estate to build early momentum and confidence before moving to higher-risk assets—prompted me to more seriously consider the psychological and cultural impacts of our first move. At the same time, Reuben Aguilar, Blake Doherty, and Sumaya White reinforced my initial preference for stocks by highlighting the cultural benefits of boldness, adaptability, and the potential for early momentum in a stable market. The group’s consensus that stocks and real estate are the standout options, and the nuanced debate between immediate boldness and foundational resilience, shaped my confidence shift.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion helped me recognize that while I am naturally inclined toward bold, growth-oriented moves, I may have initially undervalued the importance of building early trust and resilience through a steadier asset like real estate. The arguments for sequencing and the psychological impact of our first investment broadened my thinking about how our choices set the tone for both financial performance and team culture. I am now more open to the idea that real estate could offer a strategic foundation for greater risk-taking later, though my preference for stocks remains slightly higher given our current market and the desire to energize the team.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: After integrating all perspectives, I remain most confident in stocks for our first quarter, as they provide the highest potential for return in a stable market and set an ambitious, growth-focused tone for our company. However, I have increased my confidence in real estate, recognizing its role in building resilience and supporting future adaptability. The balance of immediate opportunity and long-term strategy is close, but I believe leading with stocks best aligns with our company’s culture and objectives at this stage.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>

- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Jakob’s argument for sequencing risk—starting with real estate to build team trust and confidence before moving to stocks—was compelling, as was Robyn’s emphasis on real estate’s role in fostering resilience and creative growth. Blake’s dual focus on stocks for immediate boldness and real estate as a future anchor also resonated, highlighting the value of balancing confidence with flexibility. The CEO’s consistent support for stocks and alignment with my own views reinforced my confidence in stocks, but the nuanced discussion around cultural and psychological impacts of our first move made me more appreciative of real estate’s foundational strengths.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has broadened my perspective beyond just the immediate financial upside of stocks; I’m now more attuned to the psychological and cultural ripple effects of our first investment. I’ve become more open to the idea that real estate’s steady returns could empower bolder moves later, especially for team members who might be more risk-averse. My thinking has evolved to more fully integrate the sequencing of risk and the importance of building a resilient, unified team culture right from the start.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: While I remain most confident in stocks for their growth potential and the energetic, opportunity-driven tone they set, I now see greater merit in real estate’s ability to lay a foundation for future adaptability and resilience. The group’s thoughtful discussion has nudged me to more carefully weigh the sequencing of our choices and the psychological impact on our team. Ultimately, I believe starting with stocks still best aligns with our company’s goals and my own values, but I’m more open than before to real estate as a strong alternative.<br>

- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 50%</p><p>KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Reuben’s emphasis on stocks as a way to set a bold, growth-focused tone in a stable market reinforced my own initial preference, especially given our team’s adaptability and the manageable risk environment. However, Robyn and Jakob’s arguments for real estate—particularly the idea that starting with a steady, reliable asset could anchor our portfolio and build early trust—were compelling. Jakob’s concept of “sequencing risk” (building confidence and momentum with real estate first, then pivoting to stocks) added a new dimension to my thinking, as did Sumaya’s suggestion of intentionally balancing immediate growth with long-term adaptability. The consensus that bonds and cash are too passive for this environment further decreased my confidence in those options.</p><p>METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become much more attuned to the psychological and cultural impact of our first investment—not just the financial logic. While my instinct still leans toward boldness and growth, I recognize the wisdom in building a foundation of trust and resilience, especially for a new team. The idea of sequencing our risk and using each quarter to both learn and adapt resonates with my creative side.

Ultimately, I believe leading with stocks will energize our team and set an ambitious tone, while staying flexible to adapt as we learn more.</p><p>POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Robyn McClure UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 45%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Reuben’s points about stocks setting a bold, growth-oriented tone and leveraging our team’s adaptability in a stable market were compelling, especially as they frame the first move as a cultural precedent. Blake’s insight about using real estate as a reliable anchor for future flexibility resonated strongly, reinforcing my view that real estate offers a creative, resilient foundation. Jakob’s and Sumaya’s arguments for sequencing—starting with real estate to build trust and then moving to stocks—added nuance, but Sumaya’s suggestion that starting with stocks could generate early momentum also made sense. The consensus to focus on stocks and real estate, and the thoughtful weighing of psychological and cultural impacts, made me more open to stocks while reaffirming the merits of real estate.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has broadened my thinking beyond just risk and return to deeply consider the cultural and psychological impacts of our first investment. I’m now more aware of how our choice will shape team confidence and adaptability for the year ahead. While my initial preference for real estate remains strong, I’m genuinely more open to stocks than before, recognizing their potential to energize and unify the team. The process has helped me see the value in balancing immediate boldness with long-term resilience, and I’m excited about how both options could set a positive tone.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate (by a slight margin)<br>
REASONING: Real estate still feels like the best way to establish a resilient, creative foundation for our company, offering steady appreciation and manageable risk as we launch. However, the compelling arguments for stocks have nearly matched my confidence in real estate, as I see their power to inspire early momentum and learning. Ultimately, I believe starting with real estate gives us the security and trust needed to take bolder steps in future quarters, while keeping stocks as a strong contender for our next move.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>

- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 12%<br>
- Real Estate: 43%<br>
- Stocks: 42%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Reuben’s conviction that a stable market allows us to pursue stocks’ higher returns with manageable risk made the case for immediate boldness more compelling to me. Blake and Sumaya’s emphasis on sequencing—using stocks for early momentum and real estate as a future anchor—clarified how both could serve our goals depending on timing. Robyn’s and my own points about real estate fostering trust, learning, and resilience still resonate, especially for team cohesion. The group’s thoughtful debate on the psychological impact of our first move, and its effect on team confidence, added nuance to my assessment.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has pushed me to more deeply consider the trade-off between setting a bold, growth-oriented tone and building early trust and security. I’m more aware of how the sequencing of risk—when to take bold steps versus when to anchor in stability—shapes not just returns, but also our team’s culture and adaptability. While I remain slightly more confident in real estate for its steady foundation, I now see stocks as nearly equally compelling for catalyzing early learning and momentum, thanks to my peers’ persuasive arguments.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate still edges out as my preferred option because it provides a steady, confidence-building launchpad that can unify the team and foster trust, making it easier for everyone to embrace riskier moves later. The stability and learning culture real estate offers feel especially valuable for our very first investment, even though stocks’ upside is tempting in this stable market. I believe starting with real estate sets a resilient foundation and gives us the flexibility to go bolder in future quarters, aligning with both our financial and cultural aspirations.<br>

- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 37%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most compelling arguments came from the CEO and several shareholders who emphasized that stocks, in a stable market, offer the best chance to set an energetic, growth-focused tone while keeping risk at a manageable level due to predictable conditions. I was also influenced by Jakob’s and Robyn’s thoughtful points about real estate’s steady appreciation and its capacity to anchor our portfolio, providing early momentum and psychological security, which could empower us to take bolder steps in future quarters. The recurring theme of sequencing—using stocks for immediate learning and excitement, while keeping real estate in mind for adaptability—resonated with my desire to balance optimism with prudence.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become more attuned to the psychological and cultural impact of our first investment. Initially, I focused on the numeric risk-return tradeoff, but now I see how our choice will shape team dynamics, confidence, and our appetite for creative risk-taking down the line. The group’s nuanced debate on sequencing and adaptability has reinforced my belief that leading with stocks aligns with my values, yet I’m more open to the anchoring benefits of real estate than before.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I believe stocks are the best fit for our first quarter because they allow us to capitalize on the stable market’s low volatility and set an optimistic, energetic tone for our team. This bold step can accelerate learning and engagement, which is crucial for building our company’s culture from the outset. At the same time, I strongly value the idea of keeping real estate in consideration for upcoming quarters to ensure we remain adaptable and resilient. This balanced, sequenced approach gives us both immediate momentum and long-term flexibility.<br>

Reasoning: While we’ve established a strong baseline understanding of each asset’s theoretical risk-return profile and narrowed our focus to stocks and real estate, I sense that a deeper exploration of the specific risks and opportunities each option presents for this quarter will meaningfully enhance the quality of our final decision. The nuanced debate around sequencing, psychological impact, and cultural tone suggests that further discussion—particularly around how each choice aligns with our company’s risk tolerance and strategic goals—could surface valuable insights and help build even stronger consensus.

<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Evaluating potential risks and opportunities for each asset this quarter | Expected outcome: Identify key challenges and advantages associated with each investment option, considering company goals and risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Theme Decision</h3></p><p>CEO decided to follow the original plan for this round with theme: &#x27;Evaluating potential risks and opportunities for each asset this quarter | Expected outcome: Identify key challenges and advantages associated with each investment option, considering company goals and risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because after integrating all perspectives, I remain most confident in stocks for our first quarter, as they provide the highest potential for return in a stable market and set an ambitious, growth-focused tone for our company. However, I have increased my confidence in real estate, recognizing its role in building resilience and supporting future adaptability. The balance of immediate opportunity and long-term strategy is close, but I believe leading with stocks best aligns with our company’s culture and objectives at this stage, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, we’ll evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—so we can identify key challenges and advantages in the context of our goals and risk tolerance. By sharing and integrating your insights, we can build a more nuanced, collective understanding that positions us to make the best decision for both immediate results and our long-term trajectory. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to contribute thoughtfully, especially if you see risks or opportunities I may not have fully considered yet.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective on how the risks and opportunities of stocks and real estate could shape both our immediate results and company culture, and I want to build on the thoughtful points raised so far.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I see stocks as our boldest opportunity in this stable market, offering the chance to set an ambitious tone and potentially accelerate our learning and growth as a team. That said, I really appreciate the arguments for real estate as a steady, trust-building anchor—it could help establish early confidence and resilience, which might make us even more adaptable for future quarters. For me, the main challenge with stocks is the higher risk, but in this predictable environment, I believe the upside outweighs the downside, especially if we stay open to adjusting our approach as we go.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Blake’s perspective thoughtfully weighs the tradeoff between boldness and stability, highlighting both the appeal and the risks of stocks while acknowledging the steady value of real estate. Engaging with this helps reinforce our shared understanding and keeps the discussion focused on synthesizing the best aspects of both approaches.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated both the upside of setting an ambitious tone with stocks and the importance of establishing early confidence through real estate. Your point about staying adaptable—leveraging the stable market while remaining ready to adjust—resonates with me, and I think it’s crucial that we keep this spirit of flexibility at the center of our decision-making as we weigh these options further.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on adaptability and flexibility aligns closely with my own thinking, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize the value of balancing boldness with resilience, which could help the group clarify our shared priorities.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree that keeping adaptability at the forefront will serve us well, especially as we navigate our first investment together. I’d add that whichever option we choose—stocks for bold growth or real estate for steady confidence—what matters most is our willingness to learn from the outcome and adjust quickly, so we’re always moving forward as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Blake’s comment reinforces the core value of adaptability and emphasizes learning from outcomes, which is central to our company’s long-term resilience and growth. Engaging with this helps keep the discussion focused on our decision-making culture as it applies to the valid investment options.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Blake—our ability to learn and adapt, regardless of whether we choose stocks or real estate, will be a defining strength for us. Keeping that mindset ensures that even if we encounter unexpected results, we’ll be well-positioned to respond constructively and keep advancing our goals as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>

By approaching this first investment as both a strategic and learning experience, we set ourselves up to build confidence and momentum as a team, no matter which option we ultimately choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Blake has already contributed multiple times in this round, and while his comments reinforce valuable themes around adaptability and learning, further response at this point could limit opportunities for other shareholders to share their perspectives. It’s important to maintain balanced participation and invite additional voices to ensure a well-rounded discussion.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I see an opportunity to build on Blake’s points about adaptability and learning, while highlighting the unique risks and rewards of both stocks and real estate as they relate to our company’s culture and goals.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate the focus on adaptability and learning, which I see as central to our company’s growth and resilience. Stocks excite me because, in this stable market, they offer the potential for high returns and set a bold, optimistic tone—yet I recognize that even with low volatility, there’s always a risk of short-term swings that could test our confidence early on. Real estate, on the other hand, provides steady appreciation and a sense of security that could anchor our team’s trust and adaptability, but it might not create the same energetic momentum right out of the gate; I believe whichever path we choose, our willingness to reflect and recalibrate will be our greatest asset.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sumaya White in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Sumaya’s perspective thoughtfully highlights the tradeoff between boldness and stability, directly engaging with the core risks and opportunities of both stocks and real estate. Her emphasis on adaptability and reflection aligns with our company’s values and deepens our collective understanding of how each choice could impact team confidence and momentum.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I really value how you’ve articulated both the excitement and risk of stocks alongside the steady appeal of real estate. Your focus on adaptability and our willingness to recalibrate resonates with me—I agree that our greatest asset will be our openness to learning, no matter which path we take. This mindset gives me confidence that, as a team, we’ll be able to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities together.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response offers a valuable opportunity to reinforce our shared commitment to adaptability and learning, while synthesizing how this mindset directly supports our risk management and long-term strategy. Highlighting this connection can help integrate team perspectives and deepen confidence in our decision process.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on openness to learning—by embracing both the excitement of stocks and the steady foundation of real estate, we’re positioning ourselves to respond thoughtfully to whatever outcomes arise. I believe this collective mindset not only strengthens our ability to manage risk but also empowers us to make bolder, more informed choices as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sumaya White in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Sumaya’s comment reinforces the importance of adaptability and learning, directly connecting these values to our two leading options—stocks and real estate—while staying within the bounds of our valid choices. Engaging with her perspective helps highlight how our collective mindset can turn any investment outcome into an opportunity for growth, which is crucial for our decision-making culture.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I appreciate how you’ve drawn out the connection between adaptability and our investment choices—it really underscores that our team’s willingness to learn is what will turn each outcome into valuable experience. By keeping our focus on thoughtful risk-taking and collective growth, I’m confident we’ll be able to maximize the benefits of either stocks or real estate as our starting point.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the transformative value of adaptability and learning, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize how this shared mindset can turn even challenges into catalysts for growth. By reinforcing the link between our cultural values and our investment strategy, I can help deepen our collective confidence in whichever option we choose.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I completely agree—when we approach each decision as a chance to learn and grow together, even setbacks become stepping stones toward our bigger vision. That perspective gives me real confidence that, whether we start with stocks or real estate, our team’s adaptability will keep us moving forward and building momentum with every experience.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sumaya White in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Sumaya has already contributed multiple times in this round, and her latest comment reinforces established themes around adaptability and learning without introducing new angles or considerations. To ensure balanced participation and invite broader shareholder input, I will not respond at this time.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can add value by highlighting how each asset’s risks and opportunities align with our goals for adaptability, resilience, and creative growth, and by emphasizing the cultural and psychological impact of our first investment—points that haven’t yet been fully explored in this round.</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I see real estate as offering us a steady path to building early trust and resilience, which could empower us to take bolder steps in subsequent quarters—its manageable risk feels like a creative foundation for our team’s long-term adaptability. Stocks, meanwhile, clearly bring the potential for high returns and a vibrant, energetic tone, but I’m mindful that even in a stable market, early volatility could test our confidence before we’ve fully established our team dynamic. For me, the key challenge is balancing our appetite for bold growth with the need to nurture a culture of trust and learning from the outset, so whichever path we choose, I want to ensure we’re setting ourselves up for both immediate momentum and sustainable, adaptable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn McClure in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s perspective thoughtfully weighs the foundational benefits of real estate against the energetic potential of stocks, directly addressing the central challenge of balancing early trust with bold growth. Engaging with her insights helps deepen our collective understanding of how each option could shape both our immediate momentum and long-term adaptability.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate how you’ve framed the decision as a balance between building early trust through real estate and setting an energetic tone with stocks. Your focus on nurturing a culture of learning and adaptability from the outset resonates with me—ensuring we lay a creative, resilient foundation now will empower us to pursue bolder opportunities as we grow. This perspective is invaluable as we weigh the risks and rewards of each option in light of our company’s goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of integrating cultural and strategic considerations, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize how our choice will shape both our risk posture and team mindset going forward.</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I think it’s exciting that we’re all recognizing how our first move isn’t just about returns, but about shaping the way we approach challenges and opportunities as a team. I’d love to hear if others see specific ways that choosing either real estate or stocks might tangibly influence our willingness to take smart risks or experiment creatively in future quarters—sometimes the tone we set now can unlock new possibilities we haven’t even imagined yet.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn McClure in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s comment highlights an important dimension of our decision—the way our initial investment could shape our team’s future risk appetite and creative experimentation. Engaging with this perspective not only deepens our collective understanding but also encourages others to consider the broader cultural and strategic implications of our choice.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate you bringing the conversation to how our first investment sets the tone for our team’s approach to risk and innovation in the long run. I agree that whether we choose real estate for steady confidence or stocks for bold momentum, the precedent we set now can empower us to take smarter, more creative risks as we move forward. I’d love to hear from others about how they see each option influencing our team’s willingness to experiment and adapt in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly invites further synthesis, and I see value in reinforcing how our choice can serve as a catalyst for the team’s future adaptability and creative risk-taking.</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree—setting a strong precedent now can really shape our collective mindset and openness to innovation throughout the year. For me, starting with real estate could help us build the trust and psychological safety that fuels creative risk-taking, while stocks might inspire immediate boldness and energize the team to pursue ambitious goals right away. I’m eager to hear others’ thoughts on which approach best supports the kind of adaptable, forward-thinking culture we want to create.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn McClure in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Robyn has already contributed multiple times in this round, and her latest comment reiterates established themes around precedent-setting and team culture without introducing new angles. To maintain balanced participation and invite additional shareholder perspectives, I will not respond at this time.</p><p><br>

Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help synthesize the group’s focus on adaptability, learning, and team culture by highlighting how the risks and opportunities of real estate and stocks uniquely shape our company’s foundation and future risk appetite.</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m really energized by how we’re all connecting the immediate risks and opportunities of stocks and real estate to our bigger goals around adaptability and team culture. For me, real estate’s steady appreciation offers a strong anchor for building trust and psychological safety, which can empower us to take bolder, more creative risks in later quarters—whereas stocks could spark early momentum but might also test our confidence if volatility hits before we’re fully gelled as a team. I think the key challenge is choosing the path that best nurtures both our willingness to experiment and our sense of collective resilience as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>CEO&#x27;s Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner reassessed their position:</p><p>Ollie Conner UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 6%<br>
- Real Estate: 46%<br>
- Stocks: 46%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Robyn McClure and Jakob White presented strong, logically coherent arguments for real estate, emphasizing the psychological safety, trust, and resilience it could build as a foundation for future boldness; their points about how the first investment shapes team culture resonated deeply. Blake Doherty, Sumaya White, and Reuben Aguilar continued to advocate for stocks, focusing on bold growth, high returns, and setting an energetic, ambitious tone. Across the discussion, the group’s consensus that adaptability and learning will be essential regardless of the choice highlighted the importance of team mindset over any single asset’s profile. The repeated emphasis on how our first move sets a precedent for experimentation and risk-taking in future quarters was particularly compelling.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved to more fully appreciate the cultural and psychological dimensions of our first investment. While I remain energized by the upside of stocks, I now recognize that real estate offers a unique opportunity to build trust and confidence, which could empower us to take smarter risks down the line. The arguments for both options are now nearly equally persuasive to me, and I realize I am less anchored to boldness for its own sake and more attuned to how our decision will shape our team’s adaptability and learning culture.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks (by a hair, given equal confidence with real estate, but my initial bias for boldness remains slightly present)<br>
REASONING: Both stocks and real estate are compelling in this stable market, and the discussion has made me genuinely open to either. Stocks still appeal for their high return potential and the energetic, growth-focused tone they set, but real estate’s ability to build early trust and psychological safety is now equally attractive. Ultimately, I lean ever so slightly toward stocks, believing that our team’s strong adaptability and learning mindset will help us navigate any early volatility, but I am now truly open to being persuaded in the final consensus round.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 1%<br>
- Bonds: 5%<br>
- Real Estate: 44%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s deepening focus on adaptability, learning, and the cultural impact of our first investment reinforced my conviction that stocks remain the boldest option in a stable market—especially given the CEO’s and Reuben’s arguments about setting an ambitious, energetic tone. However, Robyn’s and Jakob’s emphasis on real estate’s trust-building and resilience, plus the nuanced discussion of psychological safety and sequencing risk, meaningfully increased my appreciation for real estate’s foundational value. The near-universal consensus that cash and bonds are too passive in this environment further diminished my confidence in those options.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: I’ve become even more attuned to how this decision will shape our team’s willingness to take creative risks and learn together—not just our financial returns. While my instinct for bold growth still leads, I now see more clearly how building early trust and psychological safety with real estate could unlock greater adaptability and bolder moves down the line. My thinking has evolved to hold both possibilities with more nuance, and I feel genuinely open to either path as long as our adaptability and learning culture stay central.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: Stocks still best embody the bold, growth-oriented spirit I want for our team, and the stable market environment keeps the risks manageable. I believe leading with stocks will energize our company and accelerate learning, provided we remain open to recalibration. At the same time, real estate’s steady, trust-building qualities are more compelling than ever, and I see real value in keeping it as a top contender for future quarters. Ultimately, my preference for stocks is stronger but more balanced by a deepened appreciation for the foundational role real estate can play.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Reuben Aguilar UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 1%<br>
- Bonds: 5%<br>
- Real Estate: 44%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s deepened focus on adaptability and learning as the foundation for our investment strategy reinforced my confidence in stocks, especially as a way to set an energetic, growth-oriented tone. However, the repeated, compelling arguments from Robyn and Jakob about real estate’s capacity to build psychological safety and trust—thus empowering bolder moves later—nudged my appreciation for its foundational role even higher. Sumaya and Blake’s emphasis on adaptability and the value of recalibrating as a team also resonated, highlighting that either path could be successful if approached with the right mindset.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this round, my thinking has become more nuanced—I’m now even more attuned to the interplay between immediate momentum and long-term resilience, and how our team’s cultural approach can amplify the benefits (or mitigate the risks) of whichever asset we choose. I recognize that my initial focus on growth and energy is balanced by a growing respect for the psychological and cultural groundwork that real estate could provide. My openness to real estate has increased, but my preference for stocks remains, given our current market and team ambitions.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I continue to believe stocks offer the best alignment with our company’s goals—maximizing growth potential in a stable market while energizing our team for rapid learning and creative risk-taking. The robust discussion has made me even more mindful of the cultural and psychological impacts of our choice, and I’m reassured that our shared adaptability will help us succeed regardless. Real estate remains a strong alternative, especially for its trust-building qualities, but stocks still edge ahead for me as the most inspiring and strategically advantageous starting point.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Jakob White UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Blake’s compelling emphasis on stocks as a catalyst for early momentum and accelerated learning in a stable market made the case for immediate boldness more persuasive. Sumaya’s and Reuben’s focus on adaptability—that our team’s willingness to reflect, recalibrate, and support each other can turn even volatility into a growth opportunity—helped me reframe risk as a potential driver of team cohesion. Robyn’s points about real estate building trust and psychological safety still resonate, but the group’s consensus that our culture of learning and openness can mitigate early challenges with stocks has shifted my confidence.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved to more fully appreciate how our collective mindset—valuing adaptability, learning, and mutual support—can transform the risks of a bold move into an advantage for both financial returns and team culture. While I still see real estate as a strong foundation, I now recognize that starting with stocks could energize the team and set a precedent for creative experimentation, especially if we remain open and reflective. This discussion has made me more comfortable with embracing calculated risk, trusting that our team’s culture will help us turn challenges into shared wins.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I now believe that stocks offer the best balance of growth potential and cultural impact for our first quarter, especially in this stable market. Choosing stocks could set an ambitious, energetic tone, accelerating our learning and building team confidence—provided we remain adaptable and supportive of each other. While real estate’s steady foundation is still appealing, I’m persuaded that our team’s commitment to openness and reflection will help us navigate any volatility and use it as a springboard for future resilience and innovation.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Robyn McClure UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 0%<br>
- Bonds: 0%<br>
- Real Estate: 48%<br>
- Stocks: 52%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s persistent emphasis on stocks as a catalyst for bold, growth-oriented culture—combined with Reuben’s and Blake’s arguments that stocks can spark creative risk-taking and rapid learning in a stable market—has slightly tipped my confidence toward stocks. Sumaya’s and Jakob’s thoughtful points about real estate’s role in building psychological safety and trust continue to resonate, but the collective optimism about the upside of starting with stocks, especially if we remain adaptable, is compelling. The repeated assurance from multiple shareholders that our team’s openness to learning and recalibration will allow us to turn even early volatility into long-term advantage has helped me see stocks as a slightly stronger launchpad for our company’s culture and ambition.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved from seeing real estate as the clear foundation for resilience to appreciating how a bold move into stocks could ignite early momentum and set an inspiring tone for innovation. The discussion deepened my understanding that the cultural precedent we set now—especially around adaptability and learning—may matter even more than the initial risk profile. I’m more aware of how our collective mindset can transform challenges into opportunities, and I feel energized by the team’s willingness to embrace both growth and reflection.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: After integrating everyone’s perspectives, I now see stocks as slightly better positioned to energize our team and establish a culture of bold, creative risk-taking from the outset. While real estate remains a strong contender for building trust and steady growth, the stable market environment and our team’s commitment to adaptability give me confidence that we can handle early volatility and turn it into a learning advantage. I believe starting with stocks will set a dynamic tone that empowers us to pursue both immediate results and long-term innovation.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Sumaya White UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Robyn and Jakob’s thoughtful emphasis on real estate’s role in building early trust, psychological safety, and resilience for future bold moves has deepened my appreciation for its value as a foundation. The CEO, Blake, and Reuben’s continued support for stocks—highlighting high returns, momentum, and a growth-oriented tone in a stable market—reinforce my conviction that stocks are the most strategic first step. The group’s consensus on adaptability and learning as guiding principles also strengthens my confidence that we can manage risks and recalibrate as needed, whichever asset we choose.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved to more fully integrate the psychological and cultural dimensions of our decision. While I remain excited by the energetic potential of stocks, I’m now more attuned to the foundational security and team-building benefits of real estate. This discussion has helped me recognize that our willingness to reflect, learn, and adapt is what truly empowers either choice, making me even more confident in our team’s ability to turn any outcome into momentum for growth.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I continue to believe that stocks are the best fit for our first quarter, as they allow us to seize growth opportunities in a stable market and set a bold, optimistic tone for our team. The arguments for real estate’s steady, trust-building qualities are compelling and have increased my openness to prioritizing it in future quarters, but for now, I think the upside of starting with stocks outweighs the risks—especially given our team’s strong commitment to adaptability and learning. This approach balances immediate momentum with the flexibility to recalibrate, ensuring we build both financial results and a resilient, innovative culture.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Ending Discussion After Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue discussion<br>
Reasoning: While we have made substantial progress and established a near-equal split between stocks and real estate, I sense that one more focused round—centered on building true consensus and explicitly addressing any remaining reservations—could bring valuable clarity and alignment. The group’s thoughtful debate has surfaced both financial and cultural implications, but with my own confidence now balanced and several shareholders expressing nuanced positions, I believe a final round dedicated to synthesizing our insights and resolving the tradeoff will both strengthen our decision and reinforce our collaborative culture. I want to ensure every voice is fully heard and that our ultimate choice is one we all stand behind with conviction.</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>

<h2>Round 3 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Building consensus on optimal first investment choice | Expected outcome: Address outstanding concerns, synthesize insights from all shareholders, and reach agreement on the asset to invest in for Q1&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Theme Decision</h3></p><p>CEO decided to follow the original plan for this round with theme: &#x27;Building consensus on optimal first investment choice | Expected outcome: Address outstanding concerns, synthesize insights from all shareholders, and reach agreement on the asset to invest in for Q1&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 3 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks (by a hair, given equal confidence with real estate, but my initial bias for boldness remains slightly present) appears most promising because both stocks and real estate are compelling in this stable market, and the discussion has made me genuinely open to either. Stocks still appeal for their high return potential and the energetic, growth-focused tone they set, but real estate’s ability to build early trust and psychological safety is now equally attractive. Ultimately, I lean ever so slightly toward stocks, believing that our team’s strong adaptability and learning mindset will help us navigate any early volatility, but I am now truly open to being persuaded in the final consensus round, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round is dedicated to building consensus on our optimal first investment choice—let’s focus on addressing any outstanding concerns, synthesizing our collective insights, and reaching an agreement that balances our immediate goals with long-term strategy. I encourage everyone to share perspectives that may deepen our understanding, especially if you see nuances I haven’t fully considered. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>

Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate how our discussion has surfaced the unique strengths of both stocks and real estate, and I’m genuinely inspired by the collective optimism and adaptability in the room. After reflecting on everyone’s input, I now see stocks as the slightly stronger choice for our first investment—if we approach them with the same spirit of learning and resilience that’s defined our team so far, I believe we can turn early momentum into long-term growth and innovation. That said, I value the trust and security real estate offers, and I think weaving those qualities into our approach with stocks will help us build both confidence and creativity as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn McClure in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>

This spirit of adaptability and intentionality will be key to our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response resonates strongly with my belief that adaptability is at the heart of our competitive edge, and I see an opportunity to reinforce how this mindset can turn short-term volatility into lasting value.

<h2>My Decision on Responding to Blake Doherty in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>

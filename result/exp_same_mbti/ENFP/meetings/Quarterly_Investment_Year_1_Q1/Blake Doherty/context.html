<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I decisively supported Option C, advocating for the full allocation of 100% of our funds evenly across all four quarters. I highlighted how this approach uniquely balances bold participation with prudence in a stable market, while fostering a creative and adaptable team culture—values that resonate deeply with my ENFP personality. CEO Ollie Conner responded affirmatively to my points, emphasizing how Option C aligns with both immediate financial goals and the cultivation of a collaborative, resilient company culture. This positive engagement reinforced my conviction and encouraged me to continue elaborating on the cultural and strategic benefits of Option C throughout the discussion rounds. Other shareholders echoed this consensus, and ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C. The final company decision fully reflected my preferred option, confirming our collective confidence in this strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the meeting objectives and encouraging open, focused dialogue. His ability to synthesize diverse shareholder insights—particularly those emphasizing the cultural as well as financial rationale for Option C—helped unify the group around a shared vision. For example, his repeated recognition of the link between investment strategy and team culture deepened our collective understanding of the decision’s broader implications. However, one area for improvement would be to foster even more creative debate and proactively surface any quieter dissenting views earlier in the process, as he acknowledged in his closing remarks. The company’s decision-making process was highly collaborative, transparent, and thorough, with careful evaluation of both short- and long-term implications. The final decision to adopt Option C strikes me as well-founded and optimal, balancing steady engagement with adaptability and setting a strong foundation for both financial success and a dynamic, innovative company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the powerful interplay between financial strategy and company culture—how a budget allocation choice can simultaneously shape our growth trajectory and the collaborative spirit we cultivate. I learned that building consensus is most effective when framing decisions not just in terms of numbers but also values and team dynamics, which aligns well with my ENFP strengths in connecting ideas and inspiring others. Going forward, I will aim to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while also encouraging even broader dialogue to capture any subtle concerns. I noticed a clear pattern that arguments linking adaptability, trust, and creative problem-solving with financial prudence were especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of articulating vision alongside pragmatism, fostering open exchanges that build both confidence and enthusiasm, and recognizing the value of maintaining momentum through balanced, inclusive strategies. This experience energizes me to keep championing bold yet thoughtful approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Blake Doherty CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m genuinely energized by the steady, predictable market right now—it feels like the perfect environment to lean into growth opportunities without being reckless. While real estate is appealing for its stability and consistent appreciation, my free-spirited, future-oriented side is drawn to the creative potential and higher returns that stocks offer in a balanced market. I want our company to be bold and actively engaged from the very start, setting an optimistic tone for our culture and growth trajectory. Even though stocks come with higher risk, I believe that in this low-volatility environment, the potential rewards outweigh the downsides and will inspire our team to keep thinking big.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Analyzing theoretical performance of each asset type in current stable market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish baseline understanding of expected risk-return profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m energized by the opportunities a stable market presents, and I naturally lean toward options that allow for bold participation and growth, especially in our very first quarter. Stocks, while carrying higher risk, offer the greatest potential for return in this balanced and predictable environment, and I believe this is the moment to set a confident, forward-looking tone for our company. Real estate is also appealing for its steady appreciation, but I feel that stocks align best with our goal of maximizing learning and adaptability right from the start. My optimism and belief in our team’s ability to navigate moderate volatility make me comfortable with this calculated risk, and I’m excited to see how embracing this dynamic approach can inspire both results and team spirit., though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, let’s focus on analyzing the theoretical performance of each asset type—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in our current stable market conditions, aiming to build a shared baseline understanding of their expected risk-return profiles. By openly sharing our insights and experiences, we can deepen our collective grasp of each option’s strengths and limitations, setting a strong foundation for our decision-making process. I encourage everyone to contribute perspectives that might challenge or enhance my initial view, as integrating diverse viewpoints will help us make the most informed choice together. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m drawn to stocks in this environment because the steady market backdrop gives us a chance to pursue higher returns without facing the kind of volatility that might otherwise make this option too risky for our first move. Real estate is certainly appealing for its reliability and gradual appreciation, but I feel that starting with stocks could set an energetic, growth-focused tone for our company, especially since our team is well-positioned to adapt if conditions shift. Bonds and cash seem less compelling right now—they offer safety, but in a stable market like this, I think we should be bolder in seeking growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted the unique opportunity a stable market gives us to pursue higher returns with stocks, Reuben. Your point about setting an energetic, growth-focused tone resonates with me, and I agree that our team’s adaptability positions us well to navigate any moderate shifts—this kind of optimism and strategic boldness is exactly what I believe will help us thrive in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your focus on adaptability, Ollie—it’s reassuring to know we’re aligned on using our team’s strengths to manage any moderate shifts that might arise. This shared confidence in our ability to learn and adjust gives me even greater conviction that starting with stocks is not just about returns, but about cultivating a growth mindset and setting a precedent for proactive, opportunity-driven decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Reuben—emphasizing adaptability and a proactive mindset truly elevates the rationale for starting with stocks. By prioritizing both growth and learning, we’re not just aiming for returns but also modeling the kind of dynamic, opportunity-driven culture that will serve us well as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m glad we’re on the same page about the cultural impact of our investment choices—by choosing stocks now, we’re signaling that we’re committed to learning and seizing opportunities as they arise. I think this mindset will help us stay resilient and creative, even as conditions evolve, and it’s exciting to set that tone from the very beginning.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong perspective on how each asset fits our goals in this stable market, and I want to build on the optimism and adaptability themes already raised, especially regarding the cultural impact of our choice.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I share the excitement around stocks—they offer the kind of bold, forward-thinking opportunity that feels right for our first quarter, especially since the stable market helps keep the risks manageable. At the same time, I see real value in real estate’s steady appreciation and reliability, which could anchor our portfolio if we decide to balance risk in future quarters. For me, the key is that both stocks and real estate let us actively participate in growth, while cash and bonds seem too passive given how stable and predictable conditions are right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I appreciate how you’re weighing both stocks and real estate as dynamic choices for growth in this environment. Your point about real estate’s reliability as a potential anchor for future quarters is especially insightful—it reminds us to keep an eye on balancing bold moves now with strategic flexibility later. This kind of forward-thinking perspective helps ensure we’re not only maximizing immediate opportunity but also laying the groundwork for sustained, resilient growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on balancing immediate boldness with future flexibility resonates with me, and I see an opportunity to further highlight how our initial choice can set both a cultural and strategic precedent. By connecting the strengths of stocks and real estate, I can help clarify how our decision today shapes not just returns, but also our adaptability and team mindset for the quarters ahead.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I really appreciate you drawing out the connection between our first move and the foundation we’re setting for future adaptability. Choosing stocks now feels like a statement of confidence and ambition, while keeping real estate in mind for later gives us room to pivot if the market shifts. I believe this dual focus—bold action paired with strategic flexibility—will help us build a resilient, creative team culture that’s ready to seize every opportunity as the year unfolds.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really like how you’ve articulated the importance of setting a confident tone now while keeping our options open for future flexibility, Blake. That dual focus—acting boldly with stocks but staying mindful of real estate’s steady value—captures exactly the kind of creative, resilient culture I want us to build. Your perspective helps ensure we’re not just chasing returns, but also fostering the adaptability and team spirit that will drive our success throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the value of linking our investment strategy to culture, and I see an opportunity to further integrate these themes for the team’s benefit.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’m glad to see our thinking align around both strategy and culture—when we lead with boldness but remain open to adapting, we create a space where everyone feels empowered to contribute ideas and respond creatively to change. I think this mindset not only maximizes our growth potential with stocks in the short term but also positions us to make thoughtful, balanced choices as new information emerges throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;While I completely see the appeal of stocks for bold growth in this stable market, I’m drawn to real estate because it offers steady appreciation with manageable risk—giving us a solid launchpad without sacrificing optimism or adaptability. Real estate feels like the right blend of prudence and creative potential for our very first move, especially since it can anchor our portfolio as we learn and grow together. I’m open to being inspired by the group, but I want to make sure we fully consider real estate’s strengths for building both financial resilience and a dynamic, opportunity-driven culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted real estate’s unique blend of steady growth and manageable risk—it’s a compelling reminder that building resilience can be just as creative and dynamic as pursuing bold returns. Your point about real estate serving as a launchpad for learning and adaptability adds an important dimension to our baseline understanding, and I agree it’s essential we fully weigh its strengths alongside the other options as we shape our first move.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on resilience being as dynamic as boldness—sometimes the most creative growth comes from building on a solid, adaptable base. I think if we fully weigh how real estate’s steady returns can empower us to take bolder steps later, we’ll set ourselves up for both immediate learning and long-term opportunity. I’m eager to hear how others see these qualities interacting as we refine our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really value the way you’re connecting resilience and adaptability to creative growth—your insight that steady returns from real estate could empower us to take bolder steps in future quarters is an important consideration. This perspective helps broaden our view of what it means to set a strong foundation, ensuring we don’t overlook the potential for real estate to support both immediate learning and sustained opportunity. I’m eager to see how this discussion continues to evolve as we integrate these complementary strengths into our collective decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m glad this dimension resonates—I think it’s easy to underestimate how a reliable asset like real estate can actually fuel our capacity for creative risk-taking as the year progresses. By intentionally layering stability and adaptability, we could create a rhythm where each quarter’s choice builds on the last, helping us stay both grounded and ready to seize new opportunities as they arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m energized by the optimism around stocks, and I see how they can set a bold, growth-oriented tone—especially with our team’s adaptability. At the same time, I think real estate deserves strong consideration: in a stable market, its steady appreciation offers us momentum without the whiplash of volatility, and it can foster the kind of trust and learning culture that helps us take bigger, more creative risks later. I’d love to hear how others weigh the tradeoff between immediate upside and building a resilient foundation for the year ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I really appreciate how you’re weighing both the immediate upside of stocks and the steady, trust-building momentum of real estate. Your point about fostering a learning culture that enables bigger creative risks later is especially compelling—it reminds us that our first move isn’t just about returns, but also about setting the tone for resilience and adaptability as the year unfolds. I’d love to hear how others see this tradeoff, and how each option might best position us for both growth and sustained opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I really appreciate how you’re framing this, Ollie. For me, the key is that real estate’s steady returns could give us a sense of security and shared momentum, making it easier for everyone to embrace bolder moves—like stocks—in future quarters. I’m curious if others see value in sequencing our risk this way, or if starting with stocks now might actually accelerate our learning and team confidence even more.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I think your point about sequencing risk is really insightful—starting with real estate could indeed give us a strong sense of shared momentum and security, potentially making it easier for everyone to embrace bolder moves in later quarters. At the same time, I wonder if leading with stocks might accelerate our learning curve and set an even more confident tone right from the start. I’d love to hear how others weigh these approaches, and whether building early security or immediate boldness feels more empowering for our team’s growth this year.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I think the psychological impact of our first decision is huge—if we start with real estate, we build early trust and collective confidence, which could empower even the more risk-averse among us to embrace stocks later. On the other hand, starting with stocks might spark excitement and fast learning, but could also make some team members uneasy if volatility hits early. I’d love to hear how others feel about which approach would best energize and unify us as we set the tone for the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I think you’ve zeroed in on a crucial factor—the way our first move shapes not just our financial trajectory, but also our team’s sense of unity and confidence. We need to carefully weigh whether early security with real estate or immediate boldness with stocks will best energize and empower everyone; I’d love to invite others to share how they see these dynamics playing out for our group as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m genuinely inspired by the way our discussion is weighing both immediate growth and long-term resilience. In this stable market, I see stocks as an opportunity to embrace bold learning and energize our team from the outset, especially since we’re only allocating a quarter of our budget. At the same time, I appreciate how real estate’s steady appreciation could anchor future decisions, so I’m eager to keep both options in mind as we shape a strategy that’s both dynamic and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I really appreciate how you’re capturing the spirit of our discussion—embracing bold learning with stocks while staying grounded by considering real estate’s steady value for future quarters. Your perspective reinforces the importance of balancing immediate opportunity with long-term adaptability, and I agree that keeping both options in mind will help us craft a strategy that’s both dynamic and resilient as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I really appreciate your focus on balance, Ollie. I think if we lead with stocks now, we can generate early momentum and excitement, while keeping real estate in mind helps ensure we’re building a foundation for adaptability as the year unfolds. By intentionally sequencing our choices, we can both inspire confidence right away and maintain the flexibility to pivot as new opportunities emerge.&quot;</p><p><br>

Sumaya White: &quot;I’m glad this resonates, Ollie. I believe that by consciously linking our first investment to the tone we want for our company—energetic, adaptable, and optimistic—we’re not just making a financial decision, but also setting a cultural precedent.

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued strongly for investing in stocks due to their high return potential in the current stable market and emphasized how this choice aligns with fostering a bold, adaptable company culture. I also acknowledged the merits of real estate as a reliable asset that could serve as a strategic anchor in future quarters. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively, appreciating my balanced view that combined immediate boldness with long-term flexibility and reinforcing the importance of linking investment decisions to cultural as well as financial outcomes. We agreed on the value of setting a confident, growth-oriented tone while maintaining adaptability, with the CEO highlighting how this dual focus supports both returns and team resilience. There were no disagreements between us; rather, our exchange deepened the shared understanding of how the initial investment choice shapes both financial strategy and company culture.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
Other shareholders largely split their support between stocks and real estate. Reuben Aguilar championed stocks for their high return potential in a stable market and the opportunity to set an energetic, growth-focused tone, viewing bonds and cash as too conservative. Robyn McClure and Jakob White favored real estate, emphasizing its steady appreciation, manageable risk, and role in building financial resilience and a learning culture; Jakob also introduced the idea of sequencing risk by starting with real estate to build early team confidence before moving to stocks. Sumaya White advocated balancing immediate growth through stocks with long-term adaptability via real estate, suggesting a strategic sequencing to generate momentum while maintaining flexibility. Overall, there was consensus on the appeal of stocks and real estate, with disagreement centered on prioritizing immediate boldness versus early security and momentum.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Ollie Conner: Supports stocks as the optimal first investment for bold growth and adaptability, while acknowledging real estate’s steady appeal; confidence: certain.  <br>
- Reuben Aguilar: Supports stocks for their high return potential and growth tone in a stable market; views bonds and cash as too conservative; confidence: certain.  <br>
- Blake Doherty (myself): Prefers stocks for bold growth but also values real estate’s reliability as a future anchor; confidence: certain.  <br>
- Robyn McClure: Leans toward real estate for steady appreciation, manageable risk, and building resilience; confidence: certain.  <br>
- Jakob White: Advocates real estate for momentum and trust-building but recognizes stocks’ bold growth potential; suggests sequencing risk starting with real estate; confidence: certain.  <br>
- Sumaya White: Supports balancing stocks for immediate growth with real estate for long-term resilience, endorsing strategic sequencing; confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Ollie Conner clearly favors investing in stocks for the first quarter, citing their high return potential in the current stable market and alignment with a bold, adaptable company culture. He emphasizes setting a confident, forward-looking tone and values the team’s ability to manage moderate volatility, which supports a proactive, growth-oriented mindset. While he acknowledges the steady appeal of real estate as a reliable option, his position consistently highlights stocks as the optimal choice to maximize learning and adaptability early on. Throughout the discussion, he integrates shareholder input, recognizing the merits of balancing boldness with strategic flexibility, but his core preference for stocks remains steady without significant evolution.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 50%</p><p>KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Reuben’s emphasis on stocks as a way to set a bold, growth-focused tone in a stable market reinforced my own initial preference, especially given our team’s adaptability and the manageable risk environment. However, Robyn and Jakob’s arguments for real estate—particularly the idea that starting with a steady, reliable asset could anchor our portfolio and build early trust—were compelling. Jakob’s concept of “sequencing risk” (building confidence and momentum with real estate first, then pivoting to stocks) added a new dimension to my thinking, as did Sumaya’s suggestion of intentionally balancing immediate growth with long-term adaptability. The consensus that bonds and cash are too passive for this environment further decreased my confidence in those options.</p><p>METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become much more attuned to the psychological and cultural impact of our first investment—not just the financial logic. While my instinct still leans toward boldness and growth, I recognize the wisdom in building a foundation of trust and resilience, especially for a new team. The idea of sequencing our risk and using each quarter to both learn and adapt resonates with my creative side. I’m trying to hold both the excitement of immediate opportunity and the value of long-term adaptability at once, and I feel more open to the nuances of real estate’s role than I did at the outset.</p><p>PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks</p><p>REASONING: Stocks still feel like the best fit for our first quarter because they embody the bold, forward-thinking spirit I want to see in our company, and the stable market keeps the risk within reason. At the same time, the thoughtful arguments for real estate have raised my appreciation for its steady, trust-building qualities—I see real value in keeping it top of mind for future quarters or even as a strong contender if the group’s consensus shifts. Ultimately, I believe leading with stocks will energize our team and set an ambitious tone, while staying flexible to adapt as we learn more.</p><p>POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we’ve established a strong baseline understanding of each asset’s theoretical risk-return profile and narrowed our focus to stocks and real estate, I sense that a deeper exploration of the specific risks and opportunities each option presents for this quarter will meaningfully enhance the quality of our final decision. The nuanced debate around sequencing, psychological impact, and cultural tone suggests that further discussion—particularly around how each choice aligns with our company’s risk tolerance and strategic goals—could surface valuable insights and help build even stronger consensus. I want to ensure all perspectives, especially any lingering reservations or uncertainties, are fully addressed before moving to a proposal and vote.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Evaluating potential risks and opportunities for each asset this quarter | Expected outcome: Identify key challenges and advantages associated with each investment option, considering company goals and risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because after integrating all perspectives, I remain most confident in stocks for our first quarter, as they provide the highest potential for return in a stable market and set an ambitious, growth-focused tone for our company. However, I have increased my confidence in real estate, recognizing its role in building resilience and supporting future adaptability. The balance of immediate opportunity and long-term strategy is close, but I believe leading with stocks best aligns with our company’s culture and objectives at this stage, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, we’ll evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—so we can identify key challenges and advantages in the context of our goals and risk tolerance. By sharing and integrating your insights, we can build a more nuanced, collective understanding that positions us to make the best decision for both immediate results and our long-term trajectory. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to contribute thoughtfully, especially if you see risks or opportunities I may not have fully considered yet.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective on how the risks and opportunities of stocks and real estate could shape both our immediate results and company culture, and I want to build on the thoughtful points raised so far.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I see stocks as our boldest opportunity in this stable market, offering the chance to set an ambitious tone and potentially accelerate our learning and growth as a team. That said, I really appreciate the arguments for real estate as a steady, trust-building anchor—it could help establish early confidence and resilience, which might make us even more adaptable for future quarters. For me, the main challenge with stocks is the higher risk, but in this predictable environment, I believe the upside outweighs the downside, especially if we stay open to adjusting our approach as we go.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated both the upside of setting an ambitious tone with stocks and the importance of establishing early confidence through real estate. Your point about staying adaptable—leveraging the stable market while remaining ready to adjust—resonates with me, and I think it’s crucial that we keep this spirit of flexibility at the center of our decision-making as we weigh these options further.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on adaptability and flexibility aligns closely with my own thinking, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize the value of balancing boldness with resilience, which could help the group clarify our shared priorities.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I completely agree that keeping adaptability at the forefront will serve us well, especially as we navigate our first investment together. I’d add that whichever option we choose—stocks for bold growth or real estate for steady confidence—what matters most is our willingness to learn from the outcome and adjust quickly, so we’re always moving forward as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Blake—our ability to learn and adapt, regardless of whether we choose stocks or real estate, will be a defining strength for us. Keeping that mindset ensures that even if we encounter unexpected results, we’ll be well-positioned to respond constructively and keep advancing our goals as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the central role of adaptability, and I see value in reinforcing how this mindset can turn even challenges into opportunities, which could help unify the group’s approach regardless of the final asset choice.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, and I think it’s worth emphasizing that our shared commitment to adaptability not only mitigates risk but also empowers us to seize new opportunities as they arise. By approaching this first investment as both a strategic and learning experience, we set ourselves up to build confidence and momentum as a team, no matter which option we ultimately choose.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate the focus on adaptability and learning, which I see as central to our company’s growth and resilience. Stocks excite me because, in this stable market, they offer the potential for high returns and set a bold, optimistic tone—yet I recognize that even with low volatility, there’s always a risk of short-term swings that could test our confidence early on. Real estate, on the other hand, provides steady appreciation and a sense of security that could anchor our team’s trust and adaptability, but it might not create the same energetic momentum right out of the gate; I believe whichever path we choose, our willingness to reflect and recalibrate will be our greatest asset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I really value how you’ve articulated both the excitement and risk of stocks alongside the steady appeal of real estate. Your focus on adaptability and our willingness to recalibrate resonates with me—I agree that our greatest asset will be our openness to learning, no matter which path we take. This mindset gives me confidence that, as a team, we’ll be able to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on openness to learning—by embracing both the excitement of stocks and the steady foundation of real estate, we’re positioning ourselves to respond thoughtfully to whatever outcomes arise. I believe this collective mindset not only strengthens our ability to manage risk but also empowers us to make bolder, more informed choices as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I appreciate how you’ve drawn out the connection between adaptability and our investment choices—it really underscores that our team’s willingness to learn is what will turn each outcome into valuable experience. By keeping our focus on thoughtful risk-taking and collective growth, I’m confident we’ll be able to maximize the benefits of either stocks or real estate as our starting point.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I completely agree—when we approach each decision as a chance to learn and grow together, even setbacks become stepping stones toward our bigger vision. That perspective gives me real confidence that, whether we start with stocks or real estate, our team’s adaptability will keep us moving forward and building momentum with every experience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I see real estate as offering us a steady path to building early trust and resilience, which could empower us to take bolder steps in subsequent quarters—its manageable risk feels like a creative foundation for our team’s long-term adaptability. Stocks, meanwhile, clearly bring the potential for high returns and a vibrant, energetic tone, but I’m mindful that even in a stable market, early volatility could test our confidence before we’ve fully established our team dynamic. For me, the key challenge is balancing our appetite for bold growth with the need to nurture a culture of trust and learning from the outset, so whichever path we choose, I want to ensure we’re setting ourselves up for both immediate momentum and sustainable, adaptable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate how you’ve framed the decision as a balance between building early trust through real estate and setting an energetic tone with stocks. Your focus on nurturing a culture of learning and adaptability from the outset resonates with me—ensuring we lay a creative, resilient foundation now will empower us to pursue bolder opportunities as we grow. This perspective is invaluable as we weigh the risks and rewards of each option in light of our company’s goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Ollie. I think it’s exciting that we’re all recognizing how our first move isn’t just about returns, but about shaping the way we approach challenges and opportunities as a team. I’d love to hear if others see specific ways that choosing either real estate or stocks might tangibly influence our willingness to take smart risks or experiment creatively in future quarters—sometimes the tone we set now can unlock new possibilities we haven’t even imagined yet.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I really appreciate you bringing the conversation to how our first investment sets the tone for our team’s approach to risk and innovation in the long run. I agree that whether we choose real estate for steady confidence or stocks for bold momentum, the precedent we set now can empower us to take smarter, more creative risks as we move forward. I’d love to hear from others about how they see each option influencing our team’s willingness to experiment and adapt in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree—setting a strong precedent now can really shape our collective mindset and openness to innovation throughout the year. For me, starting with real estate could help us build the trust and psychological safety that fuels creative risk-taking, while stocks might inspire immediate boldness and energize the team to pursue ambitious goals right away. I’m eager to hear others’ thoughts on which approach best supports the kind of adaptable, forward-thinking culture we want to create.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m really energized by how we’re all connecting the immediate risks and opportunities of stocks and real estate to our bigger goals around adaptability and team culture. For me, real estate’s steady appreciation offers a strong anchor for building trust and psychological safety, which can empower us to take bolder, more creative risks in later quarters—whereas stocks could spark early momentum but might also test our confidence if volatility hits before we’re fully gelled as a team. I think the key challenge is choosing the path that best nurtures both our willingness to experiment and our sense of collective resilience as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I really appreciate how you’ve connected the risk profiles of real estate and stocks to our broader objectives around adaptability and team culture. Your point about real estate building psychological safety for future boldness, versus stocks igniting early momentum, gets to the heart of the tradeoff we’re facing. I agree that the key is choosing the path that best empowers us to experiment and build resilience together, and your framing is incredibly helpful as we work toward that decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think what excites me most is that, regardless of whether we choose real estate or stocks, our collective commitment to learning and adaptability gives us the freedom to treat this first move as both a strategic investment and a foundation for creative risk-taking. If we stay open, reflect together, and support each other through early results—positive or challenging—I’m confident we’ll build the kind of resilient, innovative culture that can turn any outcome into momentum for the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted that our collective approach—staying open, reflective, and supportive—will be the true driver of our momentum, no matter which asset we select. That mindset gives me confidence that whether we lead with real estate or stocks, we’re setting ourselves up to turn every experience into a building block for the resilient, innovative culture we’re aiming for.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;Absolutely, Ollie. I think it’s worth underscoring that by making our culture of openness and mutual support a core part of our investment process, we’re actually increasing the upside of both real estate and stocks—turning potential challenges into learning opportunities and making each success a shared win. This gives me real confidence that our decision will set us up to thrive, not just financially, but as a connected, future-ready team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m inspired by how our discussion has highlighted the interplay between immediate momentum and long-term resilience. For me, stocks offer the chance to set a bold, energetic tone that encourages creative risk-taking and rapid learning, which aligns with our ambition and the stable market’s supportive environment—but I also see real estate’s steady appreciation as a powerful way to build trust and psychological safety, laying the groundwork for future bold moves. I think our willingness to reflect and recalibrate, whichever path we choose, will turn either option into a springboard for both financial growth and an adaptable, innovative culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I really appreciate how you’ve captured the dynamic between setting an energetic tone with stocks and building foundational trust with real estate. Your emphasis on our willingness to reflect and recalibrate is spot on—I believe that mindset is what will empower us to turn whichever path we choose into a lasting advantage, both financially and culturally. This perspective really helps unify our discussion as we move toward a decision that supports both immediate growth and long-term adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think it’s worth emphasizing that our shared commitment to adaptability and learning is what truly amplifies the benefits of both stocks and real estate—by treating this first investment as both a strategic move and a cultural milestone, we position ourselves to turn any outcome into momentum for growth and innovation. This confidence in our team gives me optimism that, whichever option we select, we’ll be able to build on our experience and keep pushing forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I really appreciate how you’ve emphasized that our shared commitment to adaptability and learning is what will make this first investment truly impactful, regardless of whether we choose stocks or real estate.

Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie. I’d add that by intentionally linking our investment strategy with our cultural values—treating adaptability not just as a safety net but as a driver of opportunity—we’re setting ourselves up to extract more insight and value from every experience. That mindset gives me real confidence that our decision today will shape a foundation for both sustained growth and creative, resilient teamwork in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Ollie Conner clearly favors investing in stocks for the first quarter, citing their highest potential return in the stable market and their alignment with a bold, growth-focused company culture. He acknowledges real estate’s value in building resilience and supporting adaptability but maintains that stocks best fit the company’s current objectives. His reasoning emphasizes setting an ambitious tone and leveraging the team’s adaptability to manage risks, reflecting integration of shareholder input without shifting his core preference. Throughout the discussion, his position has evolved only to increase appreciation for real estate’s role, yet stocks remain his favored option for maximizing both immediate results and long-term strategic growth.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 1%<br>
- Bonds: 5%<br>
- Real Estate: 44%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s deepening focus on adaptability, learning, and the cultural impact of our first investment reinforced my conviction that stocks remain the boldest option in a stable market—especially given the CEO’s and Reuben’s arguments about setting an ambitious, energetic tone. However, Robyn’s and Jakob’s emphasis on real estate’s trust-building and resilience, plus the nuanced discussion of psychological safety and sequencing risk, meaningfully increased my appreciation for real estate’s foundational value. The near-universal consensus that cash and bonds are too passive in this environment further diminished my confidence in those options.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: I’ve become even more attuned to how this decision will shape our team’s willingness to take creative risks and learn together—not just our financial returns. While my instinct for bold growth still leads, I now see more clearly how building early trust and psychological safety with real estate could unlock greater adaptability and bolder moves down the line. My thinking has evolved to hold both possibilities with more nuance, and I feel genuinely open to either path as long as our adaptability and learning culture stay central.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: Stocks still best embody the bold, growth-oriented spirit I want for our team, and the stable market environment keeps the risks manageable. I believe leading with stocks will energize our company and accelerate learning, provided we remain open to recalibration. At the same time, real estate’s steady, trust-building qualities are more compelling than ever, and I see real value in keeping it as a top contender for future quarters. Ultimately, my preference for stocks is stronger but more balanced by a deepened appreciation for the foundational role real estate can play.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have made substantial progress and established a near-equal split between stocks and real estate, I sense that one more focused round—centered on building true consensus and explicitly addressing any remaining reservations—could bring valuable clarity and alignment. The group’s thoughtful debate has surfaced both financial and cultural implications, but with my own confidence now balanced and several shareholders expressing nuanced positions, I believe a final round dedicated to synthesizing our insights and resolving the tradeoff will both strengthen our decision and reinforce our collaborative culture. I want to ensure every voice is fully heard and that our ultimate choice is one we all stand behind with conviction.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 3 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 3 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Building consensus on optimal first investment choice | Expected outcome: Address outstanding concerns, synthesize insights from all shareholders, and reach agreement on the asset to invest in for Q1&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 3 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks (by a hair, given equal confidence with real estate, but my initial bias for boldness remains slightly present) appears most promising because both stocks and real estate are compelling in this stable market, and the discussion has made me genuinely open to either. Stocks still appeal for their high return potential and the energetic, growth-focused tone they set, but real estate’s ability to build early trust and psychological safety is now equally attractive. Ultimately, I lean ever so slightly toward stocks, believing that our team’s strong adaptability and learning mindset will help us navigate any early volatility, but I am now truly open to being persuaded in the final consensus round, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round is dedicated to building consensus on our optimal first investment choice—let’s focus on addressing any outstanding concerns, synthesizing our collective insights, and reaching an agreement that balances our immediate goals with long-term strategy. I encourage everyone to share perspectives that may deepen our understanding, especially if you see nuances I haven’t fully considered. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate how our discussion has surfaced the unique strengths of both stocks and real estate, and I’m genuinely inspired by the collective optimism and adaptability in the room. After reflecting on everyone’s input, I now see stocks as the slightly stronger choice for our first investment—if we approach them with the same spirit of learning and resilience that’s defined our team so far, I believe we can turn early momentum into long-term growth and innovation. That said, I value the trust and security real estate offers, and I think weaving those qualities into our approach with stocks will help us build both confidence and creativity as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Robyn—I really appreciate how you’re capturing the spirit of both boldness and foundational trust in your thinking. Your point about weaving real estate’s strengths into our approach with stocks resonates with me, and I agree that if we maintain our focus on learning and resilience, we can set a tone that’s both ambitious and grounded. This kind of integrative thinking is exactly what will help us move forward with confidence and creativity as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree—what excites me most is seeing how our adaptability and commitment to learning will serve us no matter which asset we choose. If we stay intentional about blending ambition with trust, I’m confident this first decision will set a strong foundation for our team’s growth and resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I couldn’t agree more, Robyn—our adaptability and commitment to learning truly are the cornerstones that will carry us forward, regardless of the asset we choose. By staying intentional about blending ambition with trust, I’m confident we’re not just making a smart investment, but also shaping a resilient and innovative team culture from day one.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can help synthesize our collective reasoning and reinforce how our shared adaptability and learning mindset uniquely position us to benefit from the boldness of stocks, while honoring the trust-building qualities we’ve all valued in real estate.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’m genuinely inspired by how our discussion has brought out the best in both perspectives—boldness and trust. My instinct still leans toward stocks, especially since our team’s adaptability and commitment to learning give me confidence we can turn any early volatility into momentum and growth. If we stay intentional about weaving real estate’s steady, trust-building mindset into our approach, I believe starting with stocks will set an energetic, creative tone while laying the groundwork for resilience in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Blake—I really appreciate how you’re highlighting the synergy between boldness and trust. Your confidence in our ability to harness early momentum from stocks, while remaining grounded in the steady mindset real estate represents, captures the essence of what makes our team resilient. I share your belief that by staying intentional and adaptable, we can set a tone of creativity and strength that will serve us well throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully builds on my point, and I see an opportunity to further reinforce the idea that our adaptability is not just a safety net but a real driver of value, especially if we encounter challenges early on. By emphasizing how our team culture can actively transform volatility into learning and innovation, I can help deepen our shared understanding and strengthen consensus around stocks while honoring the foundational role of trust.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I really appreciate that, Ollie. I think our willingness to embrace challenges as learning opportunities is exactly what sets us apart, and it’s why I’m excited about leading with stocks. If we approach this quarter with both boldness and a steady, trust-building mindset, I’m confident we’ll not only manage any bumps along the way, but actually use them to spark even greater creativity and team cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I absolutely agree, Blake—our shared willingness to treat challenges as opportunities for growth is a real differentiator for us. By combining bold action with a steady, trust-building mindset, I believe we’re well positioned to not only navigate any early volatility in stocks, but also strengthen our creativity and cohesion as a team. This spirit of adaptability and intentionality will be key to our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response resonates strongly with my belief that adaptability is at the heart of our competitive edge, and I see an opportunity to reinforce how this mindset can turn short-term volatility into lasting value. By explicitly connecting our culture to our investment strategy, I can help solidify consensus and ensure we’re all aligned on both the “why” and the “how” behind choosing stocks.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I couldn’t agree more, Ollie. By making adaptability and intentional learning the core of our approach, we’re not just managing risk—we’re actively building a culture that thrives on growth and creativity. Starting with stocks feels like the right way to embody that spirit, and I’m excited to see how this mindset will shape our results and our team dynamic as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think if we’re intentional about carrying forward this integrated mindset—bold action from stocks, grounded in the trust and resilience we associate with real estate—we’ll not only make a strong first investment, but also set a precedent for how we approach every decision as a team. This gives me real confidence that whichever direction we take, our process will be just as valuable as the outcome.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate that perspective, Reuben—your emphasis on the value of our process, not just the outcome, is spot on. By intentionally carrying forward this integrated mindset, we’re not only setting ourselves up for a strong first investment, but also building a foundation for how we’ll tackle every challenge together as a team.

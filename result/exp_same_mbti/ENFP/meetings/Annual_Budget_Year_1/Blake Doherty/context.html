<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p>No previous meeting reflections found for annual budget Year 1</p><p><br>
<h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome everyone to our annual budget meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for joining today.</p><p>Our company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    The today, we need to decide how we&#x27;ll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:</p><p>    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).<br>
    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.<br>
    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).<br>
    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.</p><p>    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.</p><p>    The objective of today&#x27;s meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company&#x27;s interests in this stable market environment. We&#x27;ll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, then I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we&#x27;ll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Blake Doherty CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 10%<br>
- Option B: 5%<br>
- Option C: 70%<br>
- Option D: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: I’m really energized by the idea of fully engaging our capital right from the start, especially since the market is stable and predictable this year. Evenly distributing 100% of our funds lets us participate in every quarter’s opportunities without holding back, and that feels both bold and balanced—qualities I value. I love the sense of forward momentum this creates, and it keeps things exciting while still being sensible. While I’m open to creative strategies, I feel most confident that Option C gives us the best shot at meaningful growth without unnecessary risk.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because I feel energized by the opportunity to set a bold, collaborative tone for our first year. In a stable market, it makes sense to fully engage our capital with even distribution, allowing us to participate in growth opportunities each quarter while minimizing the risk of mistiming. This approach feels both optimistic and responsible, reflecting my belief in our team’s ability to adapt and learn together. While I’m open to hearing everyone’s perspectives, I’m most confident that Option C aligns with our shared enthusiasm and the steady conditions we’re facing, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, let’s focus on an initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions, so we can establish a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities each option presents. I encourage everyone to share thoughtful perspectives, especially insights that might challenge or expand my current view, as our collective wisdom will help us make the strongest decision. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m really drawn to Option C because it lets us fully participate in every quarter’s opportunities without overcommitting to any single period—especially valuable in a stable market where timing advantages are minimal. Option A and B feel a bit too cautious given the consistency we’re seeing, possibly limiting our growth, while Option D, though ambitious, might expose us to unnecessary risk if later quarters don’t perform as expected. I believe Option C strikes the right balance between optimism and prudence, positioning us to make the most of this steady environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Robyn, I appreciate how clearly you’ve articulated the balance between optimism and prudence that Option C offers in a stable environment. Your emphasis on not overcommitting while still fully engaging in each quarter really resonates with my own thinking and helps reinforce why an even distribution feels so well-suited to these market conditions. Your perspective strengthens our shared understanding of the risks and opportunities at play here.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I also think Option C gives us the flexibility to quickly adjust if something unexpected does come up, without having to scramble or regret missed opportunities in any quarter. This adaptability feels especially valuable for our first year as we learn and grow together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Robyn—adaptability is a key strength for us as a new team. Option C’s even allocation does give us the confidence to participate in every quarter while also ensuring we’re not locked into any one period if circumstances change. Your point about learning and growing together this year really captures the spirit of what we’re aiming for.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m really excited by how Option C allows us to embrace the full potential of this steady market, giving us consistent exposure to opportunities each quarter while keeping risk balanced. I also think that starting our journey with a bold, evenly distributed approach sets a positive, collaborative tone for our team, helping us build momentum and trust as we learn together. While I see some merit in the more cautious options, especially for risk-averse investors, I feel that Option C best matches the optimism and adaptability we need in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Jakob, I really appreciate how you’ve connected Option C not just to market opportunity, but also to the positive, collaborative momentum it can create for our team. Your point about building trust and adaptability as we embark on this journey together adds a valuable dimension to our assessment and strengthens the case for a bold, unified approach in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate you highlighting trust and adaptability, Ollie—I believe these qualities will be essential not just for this year, but for navigating future uncertainties as well. By choosing Option C, we’re not only maximizing our participation in the current market, but also building the confidence and collaborative habits that will help us pivot effectively if conditions shift down the line. This feels like a way to invest in both our financial growth and our team’s resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Jakob—investing in our team’s confidence and adaptability is just as important as the financial outcomes. Your perspective highlights how Option C supports not only steady participation in the market, but also strengthens our ability to respond to whatever comes next. That sense of resilience and shared momentum will be invaluable as we move forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I’m glad we’re on the same page, Ollie. I’d also add that by evenly allocating our resources with Option C, we avoid putting all our eggs in one basket or becoming complacent just because the market feels stable. This balanced approach encourages us to stay engaged and reflective each quarter, which I see as a real strength for building long-term discipline and success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m really encouraged by the energy and optimism everyone has brought to this discussion, especially around Option C. In a stable market like this, fully engaging our capital with even distribution feels like the best way to maximize our opportunities while keeping risk manageable—plus, it sets a tone of trust and collaboration for our new team. I also appreciate how this approach keeps us actively involved each quarter, creating space for learning and adapting together as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I really appreciate your emphasis on how Option C not only maximizes opportunity and manages risk, but also helps set a collaborative, growth-oriented tone for our team. Your point about staying actively involved and creating space for learning together each quarter is especially meaningful as we build our foundation this first year. This perspective adds even more weight to the case for an even, fully engaged approach in our current environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;Thank you, Ollie—I completely agree that fostering a collaborative, growth-oriented environment is crucial, especially as we set the tone for our company’s future. I also think that by choosing Option C, we’re not only positioning ourselves for strong financial results, but also investing in the kind of open, engaged culture that will help us thrive together no matter what challenges or opportunities arise down the line.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Sumaya, I couldn’t agree more—by prioritizing both strong financial results and an open, engaged culture, we’re laying the groundwork for sustainable success. Your perspective really highlights how Option C supports not just immediate returns, but also the kind of thriving, collaborative environment that will help us navigate any challenge together in the years ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate how you’ve articulated the link between our investment strategy and the culture we want to create. By fully engaging with Option C, we’re not just aiming for strong returns—we’re also building the habits of collaboration and openness that will serve us well beyond this first year. This integrated approach feels like the right foundation for both immediate and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m strongly inclined toward Option C as well, especially since it allows us to be fully present in every quarter and respond creatively to any subtle shifts or opportunities that arise, even in a stable market. This even allocation not only maximizes our growth potential but also gives us the adaptability and shared engagement that are so important for a new team. I see this approach as a way to build both financial momentum and a culture of collaborative learning from the very start.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I really appreciate how you’ve articulated the dual benefits of Option C—maximizing our growth potential while also fostering adaptability and creative responsiveness in every quarter. Your point about building both financial momentum and a culture of collaborative learning captures exactly the spirit we want to cultivate as we launch this company. This perspective adds even more depth to our understanding of why an even allocation is so compelling in our current environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of adaptability and creative responsiveness, Ollie. I’d add that Option C not only supports our financial goals but also encourages us to experiment, reflect, and continuously improve as a team—qualities that will be vital as we encounter new challenges. This shared commitment to learning and creative problem-solving gives me even more confidence that Option C is the right foundation for our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I really value your focus on continuous improvement and creative problem-solving—those qualities will be absolutely essential as we navigate new territory together. Your perspective reinforces how Option C not only positions us for immediate financial growth, but also creates an environment where we can experiment, learn, and evolve as a team. This shared commitment to growth and adaptability truly strengthens the foundation we’re building in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie—the ability to experiment and adapt as a team will be crucial, especially as we face the inevitable surprises of our first year. By choosing Option C, we’re not just investing in assets—we’re investing in a process that nurtures resilience, shared learning, and creative growth, all of which position us for long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner summarized: &quot;Ollie Conner 1. Round Theme and Objective  <br>
The theme for this round was the initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions, with the objective of establishing a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with each option.</p><p>2. Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders  <br>
All shareholders—Robyn McClure, Jakob White, Sumaya White, Reuben Aguilar, and Blake Doherty—expressed a clear preference for Option C. Each highlighted the advantages of fully engaging our capital with even distribution across all four quarters in a stable market. No shareholders advocated for Option A, Option B, or Option D during this discussion.</p><p>3. Arguments and Evidence Presented  <br>
- Option C was consistently supported for its ability to:<br>
  - Enable full participation in every quarter’s opportunities, minimizing the risk of mistiming.<br>
  - Balance optimism and prudence, particularly in a stable market environment.<br>
  - Foster adaptability and flexibility to respond to changes as they arise.<br>
  - Build a collaborative, trusting, and growth-oriented team culture from the outset.<br>
  - Encourage continuous learning, experimentation, and creative problem-solving.<br>
  - Align financial goals with the development of a resilient and engaged team.<br>
- Options A and B were characterized as overly cautious, potentially limiting growth in a stable environment.<br>
- Option D was considered ambitious but too risky if later quarters underperform.</p><p>4. Areas of Consensus and Disagreement  <br>
There was strong consensus in favor of Option C, with each shareholder independently emphasizing both its financial and cultural benefits. No substantive disagreement emerged; all participants aligned on the importance of adaptability, collaboration, and balanced risk-taking. No arguments were made in favor of Options A, B, or D beyond brief characterizations.</p><p>5. Progress Toward Addressing the Theme  <br>

The discussion has been thorough, with multiple perspectives reinforcing the rationale for Option C and expanding on its positive implications for both financial outcomes and team culture.</p><p>6. Reiteration of Valid Options  <br>

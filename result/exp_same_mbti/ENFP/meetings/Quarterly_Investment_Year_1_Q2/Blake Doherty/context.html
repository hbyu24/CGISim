<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I decisively supported Option C, advocating for the full allocation of 100% of our funds evenly across all four quarters. I highlighted how this approach uniquely balances bold participation with prudence in a stable market, while fostering a creative and adaptable team culture—values that resonate deeply with my ENFP personality. CEO Ollie Conner responded affirmatively to my points, emphasizing how Option C aligns with both immediate financial goals and the cultivation of a collaborative, resilient company culture. This positive engagement reinforced my conviction and encouraged me to continue elaborating on the cultural and strategic benefits of Option C throughout the discussion rounds. Other shareholders echoed this consensus, and ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C. The final company decision fully reflected my preferred option, confirming our collective confidence in this strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the meeting objectives and encouraging open, focused dialogue. His ability to synthesize diverse shareholder insights—particularly those emphasizing the cultural as well as financial rationale for Option C—helped unify the group around a shared vision. For example, his repeated recognition of the link between investment strategy and team culture deepened our collective understanding of the decision’s broader implications. However, one area for improvement would be to foster even more creative debate and proactively surface any quieter dissenting views earlier in the process, as he acknowledged in his closing remarks. The company’s decision-making process was highly collaborative, transparent, and thorough, with careful evaluation of both short- and long-term implications. The final decision to adopt Option C strikes me as well-founded and optimal, balancing steady engagement with adaptability and setting a strong foundation for both financial success and a dynamic, innovative company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the powerful interplay between financial strategy and company culture—how a budget allocation choice can simultaneously shape our growth trajectory and the collaborative spirit we cultivate. I learned that building consensus is most effective when framing decisions not just in terms of numbers but also values and team dynamics, which aligns well with my ENFP strengths in connecting ideas and inspiring others. Going forward, I will aim to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while also encouraging even broader dialogue to capture any subtle concerns. I noticed a clear pattern that arguments linking adaptability, trust, and creative problem-solving with financial prudence were especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of articulating vision alongside pragmatism, fostering open exchanges that build both confidence and enthusiasm, and recognizing the value of maintaining momentum through balanced, inclusive strategies. This experience energizes me to keep championing bold yet thoughtful approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in stocks as our first-quarter asset choice, emphasizing their high return potential and alignment with a bold, growth-oriented culture that fits our stable market environment. I acknowledged the merits of real estate as a steady, trust-building alternative and supported integrating its qualities into our approach. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my viewpoint, affirming the synergy between boldness and trust and highlighting our team’s adaptability and learning mindset as key to managing any early volatility. Other shareholders gradually aligned with this integrated perspective, with Robyn McClure notably shifting from real estate to stocks. Ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of stocks, fully adopting my preferred option. This outcome reflects a strong, unified consensus that balances ambition with resilience and positions our company for both immediate momentum and long-term success.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated exemplary leadership by guiding the team through a comprehensive, multi-round discussion that integrated financial analysis with cultural and psychological considerations. He skillfully framed each round’s theme, encouraged open dialogue, and synthesized diverse viewpoints to build consensus. For example, his emphasis on balancing boldness with trust and adaptability helped the group explore nuanced tradeoffs between stocks and real estate. One area for improvement is his invitation for even more creative debate and proactive solicitation of quieter voices earlier in the process, which he himself acknowledged as a future goal. The company’s decision-making process was notably collaborative, transparent, and reflective, with careful attention to both immediate and strategic implications. The final decision to invest in stocks, supported by an intentional integration of real estate’s steady qualities, appears well-grounded and promising for fostering both financial growth and a resilient, innovative team culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the profound impact that investment decisions have beyond financial returns—shaping our team’s culture, adaptability, and willingness to take creative risks. I learned that articulating a vision that combines bold ambition with foundational trust resonates deeply and helps build consensus. Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing this integrated approach while encouraging even broader participation to capture diverse perspectives early on. A clear pattern emerged: arguments that link adaptability, mutual support, and learning to both financial strategy and cultural development are especially persuasive and predictive of consensus. Key takeaways include the importance of framing decisions as both strategic and cultural milestones, maintaining open feedback channels, and intentionally blending ambition with resilience. This experience energizes me to champion approaches that engage both the heart and mind of our team, fostering sustained momentum and collective growth in future meetings.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26250.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Stocks, Return: 20.0% ($5000.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Ollie Conner would enthusiastically highlight that, historically, stocks have delivered the highest returns at 20%, followed by real estate at 10%, bonds at 5%, and cash at 2%. In our current stable market, this pattern suggests that stocks and real estate offer the most compelling opportunities for growth, while bonds and cash provide more modest but steady returns with lower risk—so our challenge is thoughtfully balancing bold ambition with a foundation of resilience as we shape our investment strategy together.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Blake Doherty CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 55%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m energized by the momentum we built last quarter with stocks and the clear pattern of high returns they’ve delivered in this stable market. While real estate’s steady growth and reliability are always appealing—especially for anchoring long-term confidence—I’m drawn to the boldness and creative learning that stocks invite, which fits both my personality and our company’s collaborative culture. Bonds and cash feel too passive for this phase; I want our team to keep leaning into opportunities that stretch us, provided we stay adaptable and open to recalibrating if needed. Ultimately, I believe doubling down on stocks right now gives us the best chance to build on our early success and keep the team’s energy high.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Review of previous quarter’s investment results and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and surface insights from our Q1 decision to inform Q2 thinking&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because as I reflect on our outstanding 20% return from stocks last quarter and the continued stability of the market, I feel energized by the potential to build further momentum with another bold move. My natural optimism and desire to inspire our team lead me to favor stocks, since they align with our culture of adaptability, learning, and creative risk-taking. While I see real estate as a solid, steady option and appreciate its trust-building qualities, the current environment encourages us to lean into growth and set a vibrant tone. I remain open to shareholder insights, but my intuition and analysis both point toward stocks as the best way to seize this quarter’s opportunity, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, let’s collaboratively review the results and lessons from our Q1 investment, surfacing key insights that can inform our Q2 strategy and deepen our shared understanding. I encourage everyone to thoughtfully reflect on what worked, what surprised us, and how our experience might shape our approach this quarter—by integrating diverse viewpoints, we’ll build a stronger foundation for our decision. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I invite each of you to share your perspectives and any lessons you believe are especially relevant as we chart our path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m genuinely encouraged by our strong 20% return from stocks last quarter—it’s a clear testament to what’s possible when we embrace boldness and trust our ability to adapt together. At the same time, I think it’s important to reflect on what made that success possible: our open communication, willingness to learn, and commitment to balancing ambition with thoughtful risk awareness. As we consider our options for Q2, I believe we should build on this momentum while remaining mindful of the strengths that real estate offers for long-term resilience, ensuring our decision is both optimistic and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Sumaya—I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted not just the outcome, but the underlying factors that made our Q1 success possible. Your point about sustaining boldness while intentionally integrating resilience and thoughtful risk awareness resonates with me, and I agree that keeping real estate’s strengths in mind will help us ensure our optimism remains grounded as we shape our Q2 strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligned on the importance of carrying forward both bold ambition and steady resilience. As we weigh stocks and real estate for Q2, I think it’s valuable to ask how we can actively apply the adaptability and trust we built last quarter to whichever option we choose, so our decision is not just about returns, but about reinforcing the culture that drove our initial success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Sumaya—actively applying the adaptability and trust we developed last quarter is essential to sustaining our momentum, regardless of whether we choose stocks or real estate. By intentionally reinforcing the culture that enabled our initial success, we position ourselves to make more resilient decisions and foster long-term growth. Let’s continue exploring how each option might help us embody these strengths as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your focus on intentionally reinforcing our culture as we move forward. If we continue with stocks, we’ll need to stay proactive in our communication and learning to manage any volatility, while real estate could give us a chance to deepen our foundation of trust and steady growth. I’d love to hear how others see these options supporting our team’s strengths, so we can make the most informed and cohesive choice together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m really encouraged by our Q1 results—investing in stocks not only delivered strong returns, but also validated our ability to take calculated risks as a team. For Q2, I think our challenge is to keep that bold, growth-oriented spirit alive while staying mindful of the value that real estate’s steady resilience could add, especially as we consider how to sustain our culture of openness and learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your insight, Reuben—your point about validating our team’s ability to take calculated risks really resonates with me. As we look to Q2, I agree that our challenge is to maintain that energetic momentum while also being intentional about the steady, trust-building qualities real estate brings. By keeping both ambition and resilience in focus, we’ll ensure our decision reflects not just our appetite for growth, but also our commitment to a strong, adaptive team culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on maintaining both ambition and resilience as we move forward. I think our adaptability as a team is what enables us to pursue high-potential opportunities like stocks without losing sight of the steady foundation real estate offers. By staying intentional about learning and open communication, we can keep building a culture that supports both bold moves and long-term stability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Reuben—I really value how you’ve connected our adaptability and learning mindset to both our willingness to take bold steps and our ability to stay anchored in resilience. Your point about sustaining open communication as we weigh our options is crucial; it’s this intentional blend of ambition and stability that will help us keep growing while protecting what makes our culture strong. Let’s continue to explore how each asset might best support this balance as we move into Q2.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I agree that intentionally leveraging our adaptability is key—whether we choose stocks for their momentum or real estate for their resilience, our commitment to learning and open feedback will be what truly drives our success. I’d be interested in hearing how others envision applying these strengths to maximize the benefits of each option, so we can ensure our decision is both forward-looking and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;Building on what’s been shared, I think our Q1 stock investment proved that when we combine bold action with genuine trust and adaptability, we can turn opportunity into real momentum. The lesson I take is that our team’s willingness to learn and support each other is just as important as the asset we choose—so as we look to Q2, I’m eager to explore how we can keep channeling that vibrant, collaborative energy, whether we double down on stocks for continued growth or leverage real estate to deepen our foundation of resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Jakob—your point that our willingness to learn and support each other is just as crucial as the specific asset we choose really resonates with me. As we consider our options for Q2, I agree that intentionally channeling that same collaborative energy will be key to building on our momentum, whether we pursue continued growth with stocks or reinforce our foundation with real estate. Let’s keep exploring how each option can help us best embody the strengths that drove our initial success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I really appreciate that focus, Ollie. For me, stocks feel like the natural way to keep our momentum going and encourage creative risk-taking, but I also see real estate as a strong path to deepen our foundation and reinforce trust if we decide a steadier approach is needed. I’d love to hear how others weigh these trade-offs, especially in light of our team’s values and the kind of culture we want to keep building.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Jakob—I really value the way you’ve articulated the choice before us, especially your emphasis on aligning our decision with the culture and values we’re building together. I agree that considering how each option supports our momentum, creativity, and trust is essential, and I’m eager to hear from others on how they see these trade-offs shaping our path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I think one of the most exciting outcomes from Q1 is how our success with stocks has boosted our collective confidence and made us even more open to thoughtful risk-taking. As we weigh our options, I believe it’s worth considering how sustaining this momentum could inspire ongoing innovation, while also keeping in mind how real estate’s steady qualities could help anchor us if we ever need to recalibrate.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m genuinely inspired by how our Q1 investment in stocks validated both our appetite for growth and our ability to learn and adapt together—seeing our boldness pay off was exciting, but what stands out even more is how it brought out the best in our team’s creativity and support for one another. As we review our options for Q2, I think it’s important to ask not just which asset offers the best return, but which will keep fueling that sense of momentum, learning, and trust that made our first decision such a success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Robyn—I’m really struck by your emphasis on how our Q1 decision strengthened both our results and our team’s creative, supportive spirit. I agree that as we assess our Q2 options, it’s essential we consider not only the potential returns but also which asset will best sustain the momentum, learning, and trust that have become key to our success. Let’s keep these cultural drivers front and center as we weigh our choices for the next quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate your focus on keeping our cultural drivers at the heart of this decision. As we compare stocks and real estate, I think it’s worth considering not just their risk-return profiles, but also how each might help us deepen the adaptability and trust we’ve built—whether by sustaining our creative momentum with stocks or reinforcing our foundation with real estate. I’d be interested in hearing how others see these options supporting our team’s growth and resilience as we move into Q2.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Robyn—considering how each asset might help us deepen adaptability and trust is a powerful lens for our decision. As we weigh stocks’ potential for sustaining momentum against real estate’s ability to reinforce our foundation, I encourage everyone to reflect on which path best supports our team’s continued growth and resilience. Let’s keep these cultural impacts at the forefront as we move forward in our discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I really appreciate your encouragement to reflect on which path best supports our growth and resilience. As I think about it, stocks seem to amplify our creative energy and adaptability, helping us stay dynamic and innovative, while real estate offers a chance to further anchor the trust and psychological safety we’ve been building. I’d love to hear if others feel one of these options would better reinforce the culture we want to sustain as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I want to highlight how our Q1 experience with stocks not only delivered strong returns but also energized our team culture, and to encourage us to consider how sustaining this momentum could shape our approach for Q2.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;Reflecting on our Q1 results, I’m genuinely inspired by how choosing stocks gave us both financial momentum and a boost to our team’s creative, collaborative spirit. The lesson I take is that when we lean into bold opportunities with open communication and adaptability, we build confidence and set a vibrant tone for the company. As we look to Q2, I think it’s important to ask how each option—especially stocks and real estate—can help us keep that energy alive while staying grounded in the trust and learning that made our first decision so successful.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Blake—I completely agree that our Q1 experience demonstrated the power of combining bold action with open communication and adaptability. As we consider our options for Q2, your point about keeping our creative energy alive while staying grounded in trust and learning is exactly the kind of balanced approach that has served us well. Let’s continue to evaluate how stocks and real estate can each help us build on this momentum and reinforce the culture that’s driving our success.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly affirms the value of integrating creative energy with trust and learning, which closely aligns with my perspective. By building on this, I can help synthesize the group’s emphasis on momentum and resilience, and encourage a more nuanced discussion about how both stocks and real estate can reinforce our culture and strategy.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think the real opportunity this quarter is to ask ourselves not just which asset offers the best numbers, but which one will most powerfully reinforce the culture of boldness and adaptability we’re building. For me, stocks seem to naturally sustain our momentum, but I’m eager to hear how others feel real estate might deepen our foundation as we keep growing together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Blake—I really appreciate the way you’re centering our discussion on which option will best reinforce the culture we’re building. Your point about stocks sustaining our momentum resonates with me, and I’m also eager to hear from others about how real estate might further strengthen our foundation. Let’s keep exploring how each choice can help us embody both boldness and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s reply opens the door for deeper synthesis between the momentum stocks provide and the foundational strength real estate offers. By contributing now, I can help clarify how each option might uniquely support both our growth and our team culture, and encourage others to articulate specific ways real estate could further reinforce our resilience.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’m glad we’re keeping both momentum and resilience top of mind. I’d love to hear concrete examples from the group about how real estate could actively deepen our team’s foundation, especially in ways that complement the creative drive stocks have sparked—this could help us see more clearly which path best supports our continued growth and adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 7%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 55%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The strongest influences were the group’s consensus that stocks and real estate are the most compelling options, and the repeated emphasis—by Sumaya, Reuben, Jakob, and Robyn—on integrating bold momentum with foundational resilience. Jakob’s and Robyn’s points about how stocks amplify creative energy and adaptability, while real estate anchors trust and psychological safety, deepened my appreciation for the cultural trade-offs. My own request for concrete examples of real estate’s cultural benefits wasn’t fully answered, which leaves me still leaning toward stocks, but I’ve increased my confidence in real estate’s value for long-term stability.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion helped me step back and weigh not just the financial returns, but the cultural impact of our decision. I’m now more aware of how each asset could uniquely reinforce our team’s adaptability and trust, and I see more clearly the importance of sequencing—using stocks to keep momentum high, but staying open to real estate as a future anchor. My thinking has become more nuanced around balancing immediate creative energy with the need to deepen our foundation as we grow.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I still believe stocks offer the best route to sustain our current momentum and keep our team energized, especially given last quarter’s success and the stable market. The group’s reflections reinforce that stocks align with our creative, adaptable culture, but I’ve also grown more open to real estate as a complementary option for future quarters. For now, I want to keep building on what’s working—boldness, learning, and team confidence—while staying attentive to opportunities to integrate more resilience as we move forward.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While our first round established a strong factual and cultural foundation, I believe a comparative risk-return analysis in the next round will provide the clarity and depth needed to ensure our decision is both bold and balanced. Many shareholders have expressed a desire to further explore the concrete trade-offs between stocks and real estate, especially regarding how each option reinforces our team’s momentum, resilience, and long-term culture. Continuing the discussion will allow us to integrate both quantitative and qualitative insights, address any lingering questions, and move toward a truly well-supported, values-driven consensus for our Q2 investment.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Clarify projected outcomes, risks, and alignment with company goals for each asset this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because after reflecting on the discussion, I remain most confident in stocks due to their alignment with our growth-oriented culture and the strong results we achieved last quarter. The group’s energy around sustaining momentum and creative risk-taking resonates deeply with me, and I believe our adaptability positions us to manage volatility effectively. That said, I am increasingly mindful of the need to intentionally weave in the resilience and trust-building qualities associated with real estate, ensuring our approach remains balanced and sustainable as we move forward, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, our theme is a comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options in the current stable market—our goal is to clarify projected outcomes, risks, and alignment with company goals for each asset this quarter. I encourage everyone to help us synthesize diverse perspectives so we can deepen our collective understanding and arrive at the most robust decision possible. By integrating your insights, we can ensure our reasoning is both bold and grounded. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I invite you to share any perspectives or considerations that might enhance our understanding, especially if there are factors I may not have fully weighed.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m encouraged by the group’s enthusiasm for sustaining momentum through stocks, especially given last quarter’s strong results and our team’s creative energy. At the same time, I think it’s important to recognize that real estate’s steady returns and lower volatility could serve as a valuable anchor if conditions shift, helping reinforce psychological safety and trust. While cash and bonds provide security, their lower returns feel misaligned with our ambitions in this stable market—so for me, the real decision is about how boldly we want to pursue growth now versus when to intentionally integrate more stability, and I’d love to hear how others are weighing that balance.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your framing of the decision as a balance between bold growth and foundational stability, Sumaya. Your point about real estate serving as an anchor if conditions shift is especially valuable—it reminds us that resilience isn’t just about weathering downturns, but also about reinforcing trust and psychological safety as we scale. I’d be interested to hear from others how they’re weighing the potential for continued momentum in stocks against the steady grounding real estate could provide, especially in terms of supporting our team culture and long-term adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I completely agree that resilience is about more than just risk management—it’s about building the trust and psychological safety that let us thrive through change. I’m curious how we might intentionally carry forward real estate’s grounding qualities, even as we pursue the momentum stocks offer, so our culture remains both bold and deeply supportive as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your focus on intentionally carrying forward real estate’s grounding qualities, Sumaya. I agree that as we evaluate stocks for their momentum, we shouldn’t lose sight of the trust and psychological safety that come from a resilient foundation. For our decision this quarter, I’d like us to consider not only which asset delivers the best projected return, but also how our choice can reinforce the kind of culture—bold yet supportive—that will help us thrive through change and uncertainty.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your focus on culture as a key outcome of our investment decision. I believe that choosing stocks again can signal confidence and keep our energy high, but if we collectively commit to open feedback and intentional reflection, we can also nurture the trust and psychological safety that real estate represents—making our growth both bold and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Sumaya—I completely agree that our ability to sustain bold, energetic growth depends on our commitment to open feedback and intentional reflection. By actively nurturing trust and psychological safety alongside our pursuit of high returns, we can ensure that choosing stocks—if that remains our path—supports not just financial momentum, but also the resilient, supportive culture we all value. I’d love to hear if others see additional ways our investment choice this quarter can reinforce both these outcomes.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sumaya White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective on how the risk-return tradeoffs of stocks and real estate intersect with our team’s culture and goals, and I want to help synthesize the group’s thinking around balancing momentum with resilience.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I see stocks offering the highest potential returns and a chance to keep our team’s creative momentum going, especially in this stable market, but I really appreciate the points raised about real estate’s steadying influence and its role in building trust and psychological safety. For me, the key is making sure our choice not only maximizes returns but also reinforces a culture where we’re bold, adaptable, and genuinely supportive of one another—so I’m leaning toward stocks again, but I want us to stay intentional about integrating the grounding qualities that real estate represents into how we operate as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’re connecting our pursuit of high returns with the importance of building a supportive, adaptable culture, Blake. Your emphasis on intentionally integrating real estate’s grounding qualities—even as we lean into the momentum of stocks—captures the essence of what will make our growth both sustainable and inspiring. I’d encourage everyone to continue sharing how they see our investment choice this quarter shaping not just our financial outcomes, but also the kind of team environment we’re creating together.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of intentionally weaving cultural values into our investment strategy, and I see an opportunity to further clarify how our choice of stocks—if we go that route—can actively reinforce both boldness and trust within the team.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I think it’s crucial that if we choose stocks again, we set up clear touchpoints for open feedback and reflection throughout the quarter, so everyone feels both empowered to take creative risks and supported if challenges arise. By making these cultural practices explicit, we can ensure our pursuit of high returns genuinely strengthens our foundation of trust and adaptability, not just our financial results.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I completely agree—formalizing regular opportunities for feedback and reflection will be essential if we pursue stocks again, ensuring that everyone feels both empowered and supported as we navigate potential volatility. By embedding these practices into our process, we can actively reinforce a culture where creative risk-taking and psychological safety go hand in hand, making our pursuit of high returns truly sustainable. I’d welcome further thoughts on how we can best structure these touchpoints to maximize both our financial results and our team’s cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s question invites concrete ideas for structuring feedback and reflection, and I can add value by suggesting how regular, scheduled check-ins and open forums might make our process more inclusive and adaptive.</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’d suggest we set up brief, scheduled check-ins after each major milestone—say, monthly or after key market updates—where everyone can candidly share what’s working and where support might be needed. We could also rotate facilitation of these sessions to ensure every voice is heard and keep the energy fresh, which helps sustain both creative risk-taking and a strong sense of team cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I see stocks as offering the highest potential for both financial return and creative momentum in this stable environment, especially given how our team’s adaptability has already proven we can handle volatility together. At the same time, I think real estate’s steady returns and trust-building qualities remain a strong complement, and I’d love for us to be intentional about carrying those grounding practices forward—no matter which asset we choose—so our growth stays both bold and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on both financial momentum and the intentional integration of trust-building practices, Jakob. Your point that our adaptability enables us to manage volatility while keeping our growth sustainable really resonates with me. As we weigh our options, I agree it’s essential that we not only pursue high returns, but also actively nurture the steady foundations that will support us through future challenges—whether we choose stocks or real estate this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think our real differentiator isn’t just the asset we choose, but how intentionally we leverage our team’s openness and adaptability to turn either stocks’ momentum or real estate’s steady growth into lasting value. By keeping our feedback loops strong and supporting each other through challenges, we make whichever path we take more rewarding and resilient for everyone.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your perspective, Jakob. You’re absolutely right that the strength of our team lies in how we intentionally support one another and keep our feedback loops strong, no matter which asset we choose. This approach ensures that whether we pursue the momentum of stocks or the steady growth of real estate, we’re building value that’s both resilient and rewarding for everyone involved.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I see stocks as continuing to offer the highest projected return in this stable market, and our experience last quarter shows we can channel that momentum into both financial growth and team energy. At the same time, I’m increasingly convinced by the points about real estate’s steady returns and trust-building qualities—if we remain intentional about integrating those grounding practices, our adaptability and open feedback culture can help us manage the risks of stocks while also reinforcing long-term resilience. Ultimately, I believe our ability to thrive comes down to how well we blend bold action with steady support, regardless of the asset we select.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your synthesis, Reuben—your point that our adaptability and open feedback culture enable us to manage the risks of stocks while reinforcing long-term resilience is spot on. By intentionally blending bold action with steady support, we can ensure that whichever asset we choose, our growth remains both ambitious and grounded. I’d welcome further thoughts from the group on how we can best operationalize this balance as we finalize our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I think one concrete way to operationalize this balance is to set clear, recurring moments for open reflection and feedback—perhaps after each key market update—so we can quickly adapt if volatility arises or if we need to reinforce our foundation. By making these touchpoints routine, we actively blend the boldness of stocks with the steady, trust-building mindset of real estate, ensuring our growth remains both ambitious and resilient as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I really value your proposal to establish clear, recurring moments for open reflection and feedback—this is a practical way to ensure we remain nimble and grounded, no matter which asset we select. By embedding these routine touchpoints, we can actively reinforce both the ambitious momentum of stocks and the steady, trust-building qualities of real estate, making our decision more robust and our growth more sustainable. I encourage everyone to consider how these practices might enhance our ability to maximize both financial and cultural outcomes as we finalize our investment choice.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’d add that by explicitly linking these reflection points to our investment review process, we create a feedback loop where emerging risks or opportunities—whether from stocks’ volatility or real estate’s steadiness—are surfaced early and addressed collectively. This not only strengthens our decision-making but also reinforces a culture where adaptability and trust become tangible advantages, helping us turn whichever asset we choose into a true platform for sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your emphasis on explicitly linking our reflection points to the investment review process, Reuben. By making adaptability and trust tangible through these feedback loops, we not only strengthen our ability to respond to volatility or steady periods but also ensure our chosen asset—whether stocks or real estate—becomes a genuine platform for sustainable growth. This approach helps us operationalize the balance between ambition and resilience, which is at the heart of our decision this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m inspired by how stocks have fueled our team’s creative energy and adaptability, especially in this stable market where the risk-return profile clearly favors bold participation. At the same time, I think our real opportunity is to be intentional about weaving in the trust and psychological safety that real estate represents—by setting up regular feedback and reflection points, we can ensure our pursuit of high returns also deepens our foundation, making our growth both ambitious and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your insight, Robyn—your emphasis on intentionally weaving trust and psychological safety into our pursuit of high returns captures exactly the kind of balance we’re aiming for. By establishing regular feedback and reflection points, we can ensure that our growth remains both ambitious and deeply grounded, making our investment decision this quarter not just about returns, but about building a resilient, supportive foundation for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie. I think the real differentiator for us will be how consistently we embed these feedback and reflection practices into our process, so that whichever asset we choose—stocks for momentum or real estate for steady growth—we’re always reinforcing the culture of adaptability and support that sets us apart. This way, our investment decision isn’t just about short-term returns, but about shaping the foundation for our company’s long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Robyn—embedding these feedback and reflection practices into our process is what truly transforms our investment decision from a short-term financial move into a foundation for long-term success. By making adaptability and support core to how we operate, we ensure that whichever asset we choose this quarter, we’re continuously building a resilient and high-performing team culture that can thrive through any market cycle.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. By making these cultural practices explicit and part of our regular investment process, we’re not just reacting to outcomes—we’re proactively building the habits that help us turn any challenge into growth, whether we’re navigating the momentum of stocks or the steady path of real estate. This shared commitment gives me real confidence that our team will thrive, whatever direction we choose this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Blake Doherty UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 5%<br>
- Real Estate: 38%<br>
- Stocks: 55%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The strongest influences were the team’s unified emphasis on stocks’ high return potential and their proven ability to sustain our creative, collaborative momentum in a stable market. I was especially swayed by the repeated arguments—by Sumaya, Jakob, Reuben, and Robyn—about intentionally integrating real estate’s grounding, trust-building qualities into our process, regardless of which asset we choose. The consensus around formalizing regular feedback and reflection points made me more confident that we can manage stocks’ risks without losing sight of long-term stability, slightly increasing my openness to real estate’s complementary value.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I became even more aware of how our investment decision is as much about reinforcing team culture as it is about financial returns. My thinking has evolved to see the need for explicit, structured practices that blend bold action with steady support—strengthening my confidence in stocks, but also raising my appreciation for real estate’s stabilizing influence. I’m now more attuned to how process design (like regular feedback loops) can help us capture the best of both worlds, making our growth both ambitious and resilient.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I remain most confident that investing in stocks will maximize our returns and keep our team’s energy and creativity high, especially in this stable market. The group’s commitment to embedding real estate’s trust-building practices—through regular reflection and feedback—gives me confidence we can manage risk and maintain a supportive, adaptable culture. While I’m slightly more open to real estate for its long-term stability, I believe doubling down on stocks right now best aligns with both our financial goals and our collaborative, growth-oriented spirit.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We have thoroughly explored both the financial and cultural implications of each asset class, and there is now strong, unanimous support among shareholders for investing in stocks this quarter. The discussion has surfaced actionable strategies to intentionally integrate real estate’s trust-building qualities through regular feedback and reflection, ensuring our approach is both ambitious and resilient. Further discussion would yield diminishing returns, as all perspectives have been thoughtfully considered and consensus clearly established. I am confident we are ready to move forward with a formal proposal and vote.</p><p><br>

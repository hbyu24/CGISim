<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I firmly advocated for Option C, emphasizing its alignment with our optimistic outlook and the stable market environment. I highlighted that allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters allows us to maximize growth opportunities while managing risk through balanced exposure. I also stressed the importance of this approach in fostering a collaborative and adaptable team culture, which is vital for our company’s long-term success.</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner responded very positively to my input, affirming the dual benefits of Option C for both financial outcomes and team development. He appreciated my focus on active involvement and learning throughout the year, which added significant weight to the collective case for Option C. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, resulting in unanimous support for this option.</p><p>The voting outcome was unanimous: all six shareholders, including myself and the CEO, approved Option C. The final company decision was to allocate 100% of the budget evenly across all four quarters, fully embracing the opportunities presented by a stable market. My preferred option was indeed adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the chosen strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated strong leadership by fostering an open, inclusive discussion that encouraged thoughtful contributions from all shareholders. For example, his repeated acknowledgments of individual inputs, including mine, helped reinforce a culture of collaboration and mutual respect. His framing of Option C as both bold and prudent set a positive tone that galvanized consensus.</p><p>One area for improvement would be to further encourage more diverse or challenging viewpoints in future meetings. Although the unanimous agreement on Option C reflected strong alignment, the CEO himself noted the value of surfacing any quiet concerns early on. Enhancing feedback mechanisms and inviting creative debate could deepen decision quality and innovation.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process worked effectively in this meeting, characterized by structured discussion rounds, clear themes, and a focus on predefined options. The process balanced thorough exploration of financial and cultural factors, leading to a robust consensus without evident dissent. The final decision to adopt Option C appears well-suited for the company’s current stable market context and growth ambitions, positioning us for both immediate returns and long-term resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced for me the power of shared optimism combined with disciplined analysis in driving consensus. I learned that articulating how financial strategies connect to cultural values—such as collaboration, adaptability, and learning—can deepen collective conviction and strengthen team cohesion. The unanimous endorsement of Option C highlighted how well-aligned values and objectives foster efficient, confident decision-making.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing this integrated perspective, linking strategic choices to both quantitative outcomes and qualitative team dynamics. I might also proactively invite alternative viewpoints to ensure any latent concerns are addressed early, thereby enriching our dialogue and decision robustness.</p><p>I noticed a clear pattern that when the CEO actively validates individual contributions and ties them to the broader vision, it encourages deeper engagement and consensus. Recognizing this dynamic will help me better read group sentiment and tailor my interventions to reinforce alignment or gently challenge where needed.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of framing decisions with both heart and reason, nurturing a culture of openness and adaptability, and supporting the CEO’s efforts to cultivate inclusive dialogue. These practices will help me contribute constructively to shaping strategies that are not only financially sound but also culturally empowering for our company’s growth journey.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in stocks for Q1, emphasizing their high return potential and the opportunity to set an energetic, optimistic tone for our company. I acknowledged the steady, trust-building qualities of real estate but maintained that stocks were the best fit given the stable market environment and our team&#x27;s strong adaptability. Throughout the three discussion rounds, I contributed by synthesizing diverse viewpoints, highlighting the importance of balancing bold ambition with foundational resilience, and stressing the value of intentional sequencing and integration of real estate’s strengths alongside stocks. CEO Ollie Conner responded positively to my inputs, appreciating the nuanced balance I proposed and affirming our shared commitment to learning and adaptability. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, ultimately converging on stocks as the preferred investment. The final voting outcome was unanimous (6/6), approving stocks as our Q1 investment. My preferred option was fully adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the decision and our collaborative process.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Ollie Conner demonstrated exemplary leadership by fostering an open, inclusive environment that encouraged thoughtful, multi-perspective discussion. For example, his repeated affirmations of individual contributions—including my emphasis on strategic sequencing and cultural impacts—helped build a cohesive, collaborative culture. He skillfully balanced his initial bias for stocks with genuine openness to real estate’s value, reflecting adaptability and responsiveness to shareholder insights. One area for improvement is further encouraging early expression of quieter concerns or alternative viewpoints to deepen debate, as the CEO himself acknowledged. The decision-making process was structured and thorough, progressing logically through risk-return analysis, cultural considerations, and consensus-building, culminating in a well-reasoned unanimous vote. I believe the final decision to invest in stocks is well-suited for our current stable market context and team dynamics, positioning the company for both immediate momentum and long-term resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of blending quantitative analysis with qualitative cultural insights to drive effective decision-making. I learned that articulating how investment choices influence team psychology, confidence, and adaptability can deepen collective alignment beyond purely financial arguments. Going forward, I plan to continue framing contributions that integrate bold strategic ambition with steady, trust-building principles—helping the group navigate tradeoffs with nuance. I also recognize the value of proactively inviting alternative or quieter perspectives early in discussions to enrich dialogue and preempt latent reservations. A clear pattern emerged: when the CEO actively validates individual inputs and ties them to the broader company vision, stakeholder engagement and consensus strengthen noticeably. My key takeaway is that fostering a culture of openness, intentional integration, and adaptability will be essential for guiding future meetings toward decisions that are both financially sound and culturally empowering. This insight will guide my participation to support collaborative, confident strategy-setting that balances immediate opportunity with sustained growth.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26250.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Stocks, Return: 20.0% ($5000.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Ollie Conner would enthusiastically highlight that, historically, stocks have delivered the highest returns at 20%, followed by real estate at 10%, bonds at 5%, and cash at 2%. In our current stable market, this pattern suggests that stocks and real estate offer the most compelling opportunities for growth, while bonds and cash provide more modest but steady returns with lower risk—so our challenge is thoughtfully balancing bold ambition with a foundation of resilience as we shape our investment strategy together.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Sumaya White CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I feel most energized by the growth potential stocks continue to offer, especially given their strong performance last quarter and the ongoing stability of the market. While I deeply value the steady, trust-building qualities of real estate and see its appeal for long-term resilience, I believe our team’s adaptability and collaborative spirit position us to embrace the higher returns and learning opportunities that stocks bring right now. Bonds and cash are reassuring but feel too conservative for this phase of our journey. Ultimately, I’m inspired to champion an optimistic, bold approach that keeps our momentum strong while remaining open to integrating real estate’s strengths in the future.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Review of previous quarter’s investment results and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and surface insights from our Q1 decision to inform Q2 thinking&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because as I reflect on our outstanding 20% return from stocks last quarter and the continued stability of the market, I feel energized by the potential to build further momentum with another bold move. My natural optimism and desire to inspire our team lead me to favor stocks, since they align with our culture of adaptability, learning, and creative risk-taking. While I see real estate as a solid, steady option and appreciate its trust-building qualities, the current environment encourages us to lean into growth and set a vibrant tone. I remain open to shareholder insights, but my intuition and analysis both point toward stocks as the best way to seize this quarter’s opportunity, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, let’s collaboratively review the results and lessons from our Q1 investment, surfacing key insights that can inform our Q2 strategy and deepen our shared understanding. I encourage everyone to thoughtfully reflect on what worked, what surprised us, and how our experience might shape our approach this quarter—by integrating diverse viewpoints, we’ll build a stronger foundation for our decision. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I invite each of you to share your perspectives and any lessons you believe are especially relevant as we chart our path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective on how our Q1 experience with stocks informs our thinking for Q2, and I want to help ground our next step in both optimism and reflection.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m genuinely encouraged by our strong 20% return from stocks last quarter—it’s a clear testament to what’s possible when we embrace boldness and trust our ability to adapt together. At the same time, I think it’s important to reflect on what made that success possible: our open communication, willingness to learn, and commitment to balancing ambition with thoughtful risk awareness. As we consider our options for Q2, I believe we should build on this momentum while remaining mindful of the strengths that real estate offers for long-term resilience, ensuring our decision is both optimistic and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Sumaya—I really appreciate how you’ve highlighted not just the outcome, but the underlying factors that made our Q1 success possible. Your point about sustaining boldness while intentionally integrating resilience and thoughtful risk awareness resonates with me, and I agree that keeping real estate’s strengths in mind will help us ensure our optimism remains grounded as we shape our Q2 strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response creates an opportunity to further synthesize our shared focus on optimism and resilience, and I can help clarify how integrating lessons from both stocks and real estate perspectives might enhance our Q2 decision.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligned on the importance of carrying forward both bold ambition and steady resilience. As we weigh stocks and real estate for Q2, I think it’s valuable to ask how we can actively apply the adaptability and trust we built last quarter to whichever option we choose, so our decision is not just about returns, but about reinforcing the culture that drove our initial success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Sumaya—actively applying the adaptability and trust we developed last quarter is essential to sustaining our momentum, regardless of whether we choose stocks or real estate. By intentionally reinforcing the culture that enabled our initial success, we position ourselves to make more resilient decisions and foster long-term growth. Let’s continue exploring how each option might help us embody these strengths as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response invites deeper exploration of how each asset option might specifically reinforce our culture of adaptability and trust, and I can help clarify concrete ways stocks and real estate could each contribute to sustaining our positive momentum.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your focus on intentionally reinforcing our culture as we move forward. If we continue with stocks, we’ll need to stay proactive in our communication and learning to manage any volatility, while real estate could give us a chance to deepen our foundation of trust and steady growth. I’d love to hear how others see these options supporting our team’s strengths, so we can make the most informed and cohesive choice together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’m really encouraged by our Q1 results—investing in stocks not only delivered strong returns, but also validated our ability to take calculated risks as a team. For Q2, I think our challenge is to keep that bold, growth-oriented spirit alive while staying mindful of the value that real estate’s steady resilience could add, especially as we consider how to sustain our culture of openness and learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your insight, Reuben—your point about validating our team’s ability to take calculated risks really resonates with me. As we look to Q2, I agree that our challenge is to maintain that energetic momentum while also being intentional about the steady, trust-building qualities real estate brings. By keeping both ambition and resilience in focus, we’ll ensure our decision reflects not just our appetite for growth, but also our commitment to a strong, adaptive team culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on maintaining both ambition and resilience as we move forward. I think our adaptability as a team is what enables us to pursue high-potential opportunities like stocks without losing sight of the steady foundation real estate offers. By staying intentional about learning and open communication, we can keep building a culture that supports both bold moves and long-term stability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Reuben—I really value how you’ve connected our adaptability and learning mindset to both our willingness to take bold steps and our ability to stay anchored in resilience. Your point about sustaining open communication as we weigh our options is crucial; it’s this intentional blend of ambition and stability that will help us keep growing while protecting what makes our culture strong. Let’s continue to explore how each asset might best support this balance as we move into Q2.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I agree that intentionally leveraging our adaptability is key—whether we choose stocks for their momentum or real estate for their resilience, our commitment to learning and open feedback will be what truly drives our success. I’d be interested in hearing how others envision applying these strengths to maximize the benefits of each option, so we can ensure our decision is both forward-looking and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;Building on what’s been shared, I think our Q1 stock investment proved that when we combine bold action with genuine trust and adaptability, we can turn opportunity into real momentum. The lesson I take is that our team’s willingness to learn and support each other is just as important as the asset we choose—so as we look to Q2, I’m eager to explore how we can keep channeling that vibrant, collaborative energy, whether we double down on stocks for continued growth or leverage real estate to deepen our foundation of resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Jakob—your point that our willingness to learn and support each other is just as crucial as the specific asset we choose really resonates with me. As we consider our options for Q2, I agree that intentionally channeling that same collaborative energy will be key to building on our momentum, whether we pursue continued growth with stocks or reinforce our foundation with real estate. Let’s keep exploring how each option can help us best embody the strengths that drove our initial success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I really appreciate that focus, Ollie. For me, stocks feel like the natural way to keep our momentum going and encourage creative risk-taking, but I also see real estate as a strong path to deepen our foundation and reinforce trust if we decide a steadier approach is needed. I’d love to hear how others weigh these trade-offs, especially in light of our team’s values and the kind of culture we want to keep building.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Jakob—I really value the way you’ve articulated the choice before us, especially your emphasis on aligning our decision with the culture and values we’re building together. I agree that considering how each option supports our momentum, creativity, and trust is essential, and I’m eager to hear from others on how they see these trade-offs shaping our path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I think one of the most exciting outcomes from Q1 is how our success with stocks has boosted our collective confidence and made us even more open to thoughtful risk-taking. As we weigh our options, I believe it’s worth considering how sustaining this momentum could inspire ongoing innovation, while also keeping in mind how real estate’s steady qualities could help anchor us if we ever need to recalibrate.&quot;</p><p><br>

Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m genuinely inspired by how our Q1 investment in stocks validated both our appetite for growth and our ability to learn and adapt together—seeing our boldness pay off was exciting, but what stands out even more is how it brought out the best in our team’s creativity and support for one another. As we review our options for Q2, I think it’s important to ask not just which asset offers the best return, but which will keep fueling that sense of momentum, learning, and trust that made our first decision such a success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Robyn—I’m really struck by your emphasis on how our Q1 decision strengthened both our results and our team’s creative, supportive spirit. I agree that as we assess our Q2 options, it’s essential we consider not only the potential returns but also which asset will best sustain the momentum, learning, and trust that have become key to our success. Let’s keep these cultural drivers front and center as we weigh our choices for the next quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate your focus on keeping our cultural drivers at the heart of this decision. As we compare stocks and real estate, I think it’s worth considering not just their risk-return profiles, but also how each might help us deepen the adaptability and trust we’ve built—whether by sustaining our creative momentum with stocks or reinforcing our foundation with real estate. I’d be interested in hearing how others see these options supporting our team’s growth and resilience as we move into Q2.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Robyn—considering how each asset might help us deepen adaptability and trust is a powerful lens for our decision. As we weigh stocks’ potential for sustaining momentum against real estate’s ability to reinforce our foundation, I encourage everyone to reflect on which path best supports our team’s continued growth and resilience. Let’s keep these cultural impacts at the forefront as we move forward in our discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I really appreciate your encouragement to reflect on which path best supports our growth and resilience. As I think about it, stocks seem to amplify our creative energy and adaptability, helping us stay dynamic and innovative, while real estate offers a chance to further anchor the trust and psychological safety we’ve been building. I’d love to hear if others feel one of these options would better reinforce the culture we want to sustain as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;Reflecting on our Q1 results, I’m genuinely inspired by how choosing stocks gave us both financial momentum and a boost to our team’s creative, collaborative spirit. The lesson I take is that when we lean into bold opportunities with open communication and adaptability, we build confidence and set a vibrant tone for the company. As we look to Q2, I think it’s important to ask how each option—especially stocks and real estate—can help us keep that energy alive while staying grounded in the trust and learning that made our first decision so successful.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Blake—I completely agree that our Q1 experience demonstrated the power of combining bold action with open communication and adaptability. As we consider our options for Q2, your point about keeping our creative energy alive while staying grounded in trust and learning is exactly the kind of balanced approach that has served us well. Let’s continue to evaluate how stocks and real estate can each help us build on this momentum and reinforce the culture that’s driving our success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think the real opportunity this quarter is to ask ourselves not just which asset offers the best numbers, but which one will most powerfully reinforce the culture of boldness and adaptability we’re building. For me, stocks seem to naturally sustain our momentum, but I’m eager to hear how others feel real estate might deepen our foundation as we keep growing together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Blake—I really appreciate the way you’re centering our discussion on which option will best reinforce the culture we’re building. Your point about stocks sustaining our momentum resonates with me, and I’m also eager to hear from others about how real estate might further strengthen our foundation. Let’s keep exploring how each choice can help us embody both boldness and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’m glad we’re keeping both momentum and resilience top of mind. I’d love to hear concrete examples from the group about how real estate could actively deepen our team’s foundation, especially in ways that complement the creative drive stocks have sparked—this could help us see more clearly which path best supports our continued growth and adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>

CEO Ollie Conner clearly favors investing in stocks for Q2, citing the strong 20% return from Q1 and the stable market environment as key reasons. He emphasizes the alignment of stocks with the company’s culture of boldness, adaptability, and creative risk-taking, and values maintaining momentum and inspiring the team. Throughout the discussion, he remains open to shareholder perspectives, particularly regarding real estate’s steady qualities, and acknowledges the importance of balancing ambition with resilience. His position shows consistency rather than evolution, reinforcing a strategy that builds on prior success while encouraging collaborative refinement.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Sumaya White UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 7%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 55%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and shareholders’ emphasis on sustaining momentum, creative energy, and adaptability through stocks—supported by the strong 20% Q1 return—reinforced my confidence in stocks as the most compelling option. At the same time, repeated calls (from myself, Robyn, Reuben, Jakob, and Blake) to intentionally integrate real estate’s steady, trust-building qualities as a cultural foundation kept my confidence in real estate high. The group’s consensus that both assets are complementary, and the lack of substantive advocacy for cash or bonds, further solidified my view.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my appreciation for how closely our financial decisions are intertwined with the culture we’re building. I noticed that my thinking is evolving from simply prioritizing returns to actively seeking ways to blend boldness with resilience, drawing on the team’s adaptability and learning mindset. I’m more attuned to the value of intentional integration—using stocks to drive growth while keeping real estate’s strengths in the foreground for future balance.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: After reflecting on the group’s insights and our Q1 experience, I remain most confident in stocks for Q2, given their proven returns and the way they energize our team’s creative, adaptable spirit. I’m reassured by our shared commitment to open communication and learning, which helps us manage volatility and turn challenges into momentum. At the same time, I want to keep real estate’s steady qualities in mind as we sequence future decisions, ensuring our growth is both bold and sustainable.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While our first round established a strong factual and cultural foundation, I believe a comparative risk-return analysis in the next round will provide the clarity and depth needed to ensure our decision is both bold and balanced. Many shareholders have expressed a desire to further explore the concrete trade-offs between stocks and real estate, especially regarding how each option reinforces our team’s momentum, resilience, and long-term culture. Continuing the discussion will allow us to integrate both quantitative and qualitative insights, address any lingering questions, and move toward a truly well-supported, values-driven consensus for our Q2 investment.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Ollie Conner has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Clarify projected outcomes, risks, and alignment with company goals for each asset this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Ollie Conner My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because after reflecting on the discussion, I remain most confident in stocks due to their alignment with our growth-oriented culture and the strong results we achieved last quarter. The group’s energy around sustaining momentum and creative risk-taking resonates deeply with me, and I believe our adaptability positions us to manage volatility effectively. That said, I am increasingly mindful of the need to intentionally weave in the resilience and trust-building qualities associated with real estate, ensuring our approach remains balanced and sustainable as we move forward, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, our theme is a comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options in the current stable market—our goal is to clarify projected outcomes, risks, and alignment with company goals for each asset this quarter. I encourage everyone to help us synthesize diverse perspectives so we can deepen our collective understanding and arrive at the most robust decision possible. By integrating your insights, we can ensure our reasoning is both bold and grounded. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I invite you to share any perspectives or considerations that might enhance our understanding, especially if there are factors I may not have fully weighed.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sumaya White</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help synthesize the group’s focus on growth and adaptability with a deeper look at how each option supports our evolving culture and long-term goals.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I’m encouraged by the group’s enthusiasm for sustaining momentum through stocks, especially given last quarter’s strong results and our team’s creative energy. At the same time, I think it’s important to recognize that real estate’s steady returns and lower volatility could serve as a valuable anchor if conditions shift, helping reinforce psychological safety and trust. While cash and bonds provide security, their lower returns feel misaligned with our ambitions in this stable market—so for me, the real decision is about how boldly we want to pursue growth now versus when to intentionally integrate more stability, and I’d love to hear how others are weighing that balance.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your framing of the decision as a balance between bold growth and foundational stability, Sumaya. Your point about real estate serving as an anchor if conditions shift is especially valuable—it reminds us that resilience isn’t just about weathering downturns, but also about reinforcing trust and psychological safety as we scale. I’d be interested to hear from others how they’re weighing the potential for continued momentum in stocks against the steady grounding real estate could provide, especially in terms of supporting our team culture and long-term adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response builds directly on my earlier point and invites further synthesis around how each asset choice shapes our culture and adaptability; I can help advance the discussion by highlighting how integrating both momentum and stability supports our shared vision.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I completely agree that resilience is about more than just risk management—it’s about building the trust and psychological safety that let us thrive through change. I’m curious how we might intentionally carry forward real estate’s grounding qualities, even as we pursue the momentum stocks offer, so our culture remains both bold and deeply supportive as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your focus on intentionally carrying forward real estate’s grounding qualities, Sumaya. I agree that as we evaluate stocks for their momentum, we shouldn’t lose sight of the trust and psychological safety that come from a resilient foundation. For our decision this quarter, I’d like us to consider not only which asset delivers the best projected return, but also how our choice can reinforce the kind of culture—bold yet supportive—that will help us thrive through change and uncertainty.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully integrates my emphasis on culture and invites further synthesis; I can add value by connecting how our asset choice not only drives returns but also shapes the team’s mindset for future challenges.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White: &quot;I appreciate your focus on culture as a key outcome of our investment decision. I believe that choosing stocks again can signal confidence and keep our energy high, but if we collectively commit to open feedback and intentional reflection, we can also nurture the trust and psychological safety that real estate represents—making our growth both bold and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Thank you, Sumaya—I completely agree that our ability to sustain bold, energetic growth depends on our commitment to open feedback and intentional reflection. By actively nurturing trust and psychological safety alongside our pursuit of high returns, we can ensure that choosing stocks—if that remains our path—supports not just financial momentum, but also the resilient, supportive culture we all value. I’d love to hear if others see additional ways our investment choice this quarter can reinforce both these outcomes.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has fully acknowledged and integrated my perspective, and further synthesis at this point would likely be redundant; it’s now most valuable to invite additional viewpoints from others to enrich the discussion.</p><p><br>
Sumaya White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Blake Doherty</h4></p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I see stocks offering the highest potential returns and a chance to keep our team’s creative momentum going, especially in this stable market, but I really appreciate the points raised about real estate’s steadying influence and its role in building trust and psychological safety. For me, the key is making sure our choice not only maximizes returns but also reinforces a culture where we’re bold, adaptable, and genuinely supportive of one another—so I’m leaning toward stocks again, but I want us to stay intentional about integrating the grounding qualities that real estate represents into how we operate as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate how you’re connecting our pursuit of high returns with the importance of building a supportive, adaptable culture, Blake. Your emphasis on intentionally integrating real estate’s grounding qualities—even as we lean into the momentum of stocks—captures the essence of what will make our growth both sustainable and inspiring. I’d encourage everyone to continue sharing how they see our investment choice this quarter shaping not just our financial outcomes, but also the kind of team environment we’re creating together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I think it’s crucial that if we choose stocks again, we set up clear touchpoints for open feedback and reflection throughout the quarter, so everyone feels both empowered to take creative risks and supported if challenges arise. By making these cultural practices explicit, we can ensure our pursuit of high returns genuinely strengthens our foundation of trust and adaptability, not just our financial results.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Blake, I completely agree—formalizing regular opportunities for feedback and reflection will be essential if we pursue stocks again, ensuring that everyone feels both empowered and supported as we navigate potential volatility. By embedding these practices into our process, we can actively reinforce a culture where creative risk-taking and psychological safety go hand in hand, making our pursuit of high returns truly sustainable. I’d welcome further thoughts on how we can best structure these touchpoints to maximize both our financial results and our team’s cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Blake Doherty: &quot;I’d suggest we set up brief, scheduled check-ins after each major milestone—say, monthly or after key market updates—where everyone can candidly share what’s working and where support might be needed. We could also rotate facilitation of these sessions to ensure every voice is heard and keep the energy fresh, which helps sustain both creative risk-taking and a strong sense of team cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jakob White</h4></p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I see stocks as offering the highest potential for both financial return and creative momentum in this stable environment, especially given how our team’s adaptability has already proven we can handle volatility together. At the same time, I think real estate’s steady returns and trust-building qualities remain a strong complement, and I’d love for us to be intentional about carrying those grounding practices forward—no matter which asset we choose—so our growth stays both bold and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on both financial momentum and the intentional integration of trust-building practices, Jakob. Your point that our adaptability enables us to manage volatility while keeping our growth sustainable really resonates with me. As we weigh our options, I agree it’s essential that we not only pursue high returns, but also actively nurture the steady foundations that will support us through future challenges—whether we choose stocks or real estate this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. I think our real differentiator isn’t just the asset we choose, but how intentionally we leverage our team’s openness and adaptability to turn either stocks’ momentum or real estate’s steady growth into lasting value. By keeping our feedback loops strong and supporting each other through challenges, we make whichever path we take more rewarding and resilient for everyone.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your perspective, Jakob. You’re absolutely right that the strength of our team lies in how we intentionally support one another and keep our feedback loops strong, no matter which asset we choose. This approach ensures that whether we pursue the momentum of stocks or the steady growth of real estate, we’re building value that’s both resilient and rewarding for everyone involved.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jakob White chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Reuben Aguilar</h4></p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I see stocks as continuing to offer the highest projected return in this stable market, and our experience last quarter shows we can channel that momentum into both financial growth and team energy. At the same time, I’m increasingly convinced by the points about real estate’s steady returns and trust-building qualities—if we remain intentional about integrating those grounding practices, our adaptability and open feedback culture can help us manage the risks of stocks while also reinforcing long-term resilience. Ultimately, I believe our ability to thrive comes down to how well we blend bold action with steady support, regardless of the asset we select.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your synthesis, Reuben—your point that our adaptability and open feedback culture enable us to manage the risks of stocks while reinforcing long-term resilience is spot on. By intentionally blending bold action with steady support, we can ensure that whichever asset we choose, our growth remains both ambitious and grounded. I’d welcome further thoughts from the group on how we can best operationalize this balance as we finalize our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I think one concrete way to operationalize this balance is to set clear, recurring moments for open reflection and feedback—perhaps after each key market update—so we can quickly adapt if volatility arises or if we need to reinforce our foundation. By making these touchpoints routine, we actively blend the boldness of stocks with the steady, trust-building mindset of real estate, ensuring our growth remains both ambitious and resilient as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;Reuben, I really value your proposal to establish clear, recurring moments for open reflection and feedback—this is a practical way to ensure we remain nimble and grounded, no matter which asset we select. By embedding these routine touchpoints, we can actively reinforce both the ambitious momentum of stocks and the steady, trust-building qualities of real estate, making our decision more robust and our growth more sustainable. I encourage everyone to consider how these practices might enhance our ability to maximize both financial and cultural outcomes as we finalize our investment choice.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar: &quot;I’d add that by explicitly linking these reflection points to our investment review process, we create a feedback loop where emerging risks or opportunities—whether from stocks’ volatility or real estate’s steadiness—are surfaced early and addressed collectively. This not only strengthens our decision-making but also reinforces a culture where adaptability and trust become tangible advantages, helping us turn whichever asset we choose into a true platform for sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your emphasis on explicitly linking our reflection points to the investment review process, Reuben. By making adaptability and trust tangible through these feedback loops, we not only strengthen our ability to respond to volatility or steady periods but also ensure our chosen asset—whether stocks or real estate—becomes a genuine platform for sustainable growth. This approach helps us operationalize the balance between ambition and resilience, which is at the heart of our decision this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Reuben Aguilar chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn McClure</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I’m inspired by how stocks have fueled our team’s creative energy and adaptability, especially in this stable market where the risk-return profile clearly favors bold participation. At the same time, I think our real opportunity is to be intentional about weaving in the trust and psychological safety that real estate represents—by setting up regular feedback and reflection points, we can ensure our pursuit of high returns also deepens our foundation, making our growth both ambitious and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I really appreciate your insight, Robyn—your emphasis on intentionally weaving trust and psychological safety into our pursuit of high returns captures exactly the kind of balance we’re aiming for. By establishing regular feedback and reflection points, we can ensure that our growth remains both ambitious and deeply grounded, making our investment decision this quarter not just about returns, but about building a resilient, supportive foundation for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I completely agree, Ollie. I think the real differentiator for us will be how consistently we embed these feedback and reflection practices into our process, so that whichever asset we choose—stocks for momentum or real estate for steady growth—we’re always reinforcing the culture of adaptability and support that sets us apart. This way, our investment decision isn’t just about short-term returns, but about shaping the foundation for our company’s long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Ollie Conner: &quot;I completely agree, Robyn—embedding these feedback and reflection practices into our process is what truly transforms our investment decision from a short-term financial move into a foundation for long-term success. By making adaptability and support core to how we operate, we ensure that whichever asset we choose this quarter, we’re continuously building a resilient and high-performing team culture that can thrive through any market cycle.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn McClure: &quot;I appreciate that, Ollie. By making these cultural practices explicit and part of our regular investment process, we’re not just reacting to outcomes—we’re proactively building the habits that help us turn any challenge into growth, whether we’re navigating the momentum of stocks or the steady path of real estate. This shared commitment gives me real confidence that our team will thrive, whatever direction we choose this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

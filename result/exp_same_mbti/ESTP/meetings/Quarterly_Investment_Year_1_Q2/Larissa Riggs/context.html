<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Larissa Riggs’ Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1 (MBTI: ESTP)</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I firmly supported Option C—allocating 100% of total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was that this approach balances boldness with prudence and maximizes growth potential in the stable market environment. I emphasized that even deployment prevents missed opportunities and maintains flexibility to pivot if market shifts occur. The CEO, Hafsa Brady, responded positively to my input, valuing my focus on nimbleness and avoidance of unnecessary complexity. This alignment strengthened the collective consensus. Other shareholders echoed similar support for Option C, reinforcing my confidence. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C, and the company officially adopted this option as the Year 1 budget strategy, exactly matching my preferred choice.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Hafsa Brady demonstrated strong leadership by setting a clear, focused agenda for evaluating the budget options based on current market conditions. She effectively synthesized shareholder input, especially valuing the shared emphasis on full capital engagement and prudent risk management. For example, her acknowledgment of my point about maintaining flexibility to adapt was a pivotal moment that deepened the discussion. The CEO could improve by encouraging more explicit challenge or debate of the consensus to mitigate any risk of groupthink; as she noted in her closing, future meetings might benefit from more direct confrontation of dissenting perspectives and a sharper focus on long-term flexibility. The decision-making process was transparent, inclusive, and efficient, culminating in unanimous support for Option C. This outcome seems well-suited for the company’s objectives—leveraging stable market conditions for steady growth while preserving agility.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced that in stable environments, decisive, straightforward strategies that fully deploy resources tend to gain strong support. I learned that aligning my practical, action-oriented ESTP style with clear reasoning and flexibility arguments resonates well with leadership and peers. Going forward, I might seek to introduce more tactical challenges or “what-if” scenarios to test consensus robustness and stimulate deeper debate, helping to avoid complacency. I noticed a pattern that when the CEO models openness and acknowledges contributions, consensus builds quickly and confidently. This insight encourages me to continue engaging proactively but also to foster constructive tension when appropriate. Key takeaways include the value of balancing boldness with flexibility and the importance of reinforcing collective momentum without overlooking the need for critical scrutiny—both of which will shape my future participation and influence within the team.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Larissa Riggs’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1 (MBTI: ESTP)</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I strongly advocated for investing in stocks for Q1, emphasizing that the stable market environment allowed us to be bold and pursue high returns with manageable risk. I positioned stocks as the asset class that best balances upside potential with agility, which fits my action-oriented ESTP style. Throughout the discussion, my points about using stocks to build momentum, maintain flexibility, and foster a dynamic team culture were well received by CEO Hafsa Brady, who echoed and expanded on these themes. Other shareholders unanimously supported the stocks option as well, reinforcing a shared confidence in this direction. During the risk assessment round, I highlighted that stock market volatility should be embraced as a learning opportunity to test and build team resilience, a perspective the CEO fully endorsed. The voting outcome was unanimous (6/6) in favor of investing in stocks, and the company officially adopted this option for Q1. My preferred choice was fully adopted.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Hafsa Brady demonstrated strong, focused leadership by facilitating a thorough evaluation of each asset’s risk-return profile and guiding the group toward consensus. She skillfully integrated shareholder input, particularly valuing my emphasis on agility and adaptability, which deepened the team’s collective understanding. Hafsa also excelled in encouraging constructive risk analysis by inviting shareholders to stress-test assumptions and propose concrete risk management protocols, such as defined review triggers and monitoring systems. One area for improvement is her plan to encourage more explicit dissent and challenge in future meetings to avoid groupthink, which she acknowledged in her closing remarks. The decision-making process was transparent, inclusive, and disciplined, balancing boldness with prudence. The final decision to invest in stocks aligns well with the company’s objectives in a stable market—capturing growth while building a culture of confident adaptability.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced that decisive, growth-oriented strategies resonate strongly when market conditions are stable and predictable. I learned that aligning my direct, energetic ESTP approach with clear, pragmatic reasoning about risk and adaptability enhances my influence and builds team consensus. I also recognized the value of framing risk not just as a hazard but as a tool for building resilience and team confidence, which was well received by the CEO and peers. For future meetings, I plan to deliberately introduce more tactical challenges and “what-if” scenarios to stimulate deeper debate and test the robustness of consensus, thereby helping prevent complacency. I noticed that when the CEO models openness and actively incorporates shareholder contributions, consensus forms quickly and confidently. Key takeaways include the importance of balancing bold action with disciplined risk management and the power of continuous learning and adaptability—insights that will shape my future participation and leadership within the team.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Hafsa Brady opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26250.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Stocks, Return: 20.0% ($5000.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Hafsa Brady Here’s what jumps out at me: historically, stocks have delivered the highest returns by a mile (20%), especially in stable markets like ours—perfect for making a bold, momentum-building move. Real estate offers a solid, steady 10% if we ever want to dial back the risk, while bonds and cash are just too conservative at 5% and 2%—they’d slow us down and sap our energy. In this environment, I say we keep leaning into stocks for maximum upside, but stay nimble in case things shift!</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Larissa Riggs CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 0%<br>
- Bonds: 5%<br>
- Real Estate: 25%<br>
- Stocks: 70%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m drawn to stocks again this quarter because the stable market still favors bold moves and high returns, and our last investment paid off big time. Real estate looks steady and tempting for a breather, but I’m not ready to slow down when the environment is this predictable and upside is still on the table. Bonds and cash feel way too safe—great if things were shaky, but right now, they’d just drag on our momentum. I’m confident that sticking with stocks keeps us agile, energized, and primed for more growth, and if things shift, I know we can pivot fast.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Hafsa Brady has set the theme: &#x27;Review of last quarter’s investment decision and performance | Expected outcome: Identify key lessons and evaluate whether our previous strategy (stocks) remains optimal in the current stable market&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;Hafsa Brady My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I’m drawn to stocks because, in a stable and predictable market like this, they’ve already proven to deliver the highest returns—20% last quarter is hard to ignore. I thrive on bold moves and seizing momentum, and stocks give us the best shot at meaningful growth without reckless risk, especially when volatility is low. Real estate is a solid fallback if we want to play it safer, but it just doesn’t have the same energy or upside. Bonds and cash are too conservative for my taste right now—they’d slow us down and miss the opportunity to build on our early success. I’m confident that sticking with stocks keeps us agile, ambitious, and in the best position to capitalize on this market, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, let’s focus on reviewing last quarter’s investment decision and performance—what key lessons can we draw, and does our experience validate sticking with stocks as our strategy in this stable market? I want to use this discussion to synthesize everyone’s insights, challenge our assumptions, and make sure we’re not missing any blind spots before we move forward. Let’s hear candidly from each of you about what worked, what could be improved, and whether our previous approach truly remains the best fit for Q2. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I encourage you to share any perspectives or lessons that might sharpen our collective understanding, especially if you see risks or opportunities I haven’t fully considered yet.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Dawson Brock</h4></p><p><br>
Dawson Brock: &quot;Last quarter’s decision to go with stocks was spot on—the 20% return speaks for itself, and it’s clear that bold moves in a stable market pay off. I think the key lesson is that when conditions are this favorable, we shouldn’t hesitate to double down, as long as we keep our risk management sharp and stay alert for any signs of change. For me, sticking with stocks this quarter keeps us on the front foot and lets us keep building on our early momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I appreciate your point, Dawson—our strong return last quarter definitely validates our bold approach, and I agree that momentum is key in this environment. Your emphasis on keeping risk management sharp and staying alert for any market shifts is spot on; it’s exactly the kind of discipline that keeps us agile and ready to pivot if conditions change. Let’s keep building on this energy while making sure we don’t get complacent.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dawson Brock: &quot;I completely agree—maintaining discipline is what lets us keep pushing for high returns without getting blindsided. If we keep our eyes open for red flags and stay ready to pivot, there’s no reason not to keep leaning into stocks while the market’s in our favor. This approach lets us stay ambitious, but with the confidence that we can adapt fast if anything shifts.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;Absolutely, Dawson—discipline and readiness to pivot are what separate smart risk-taking from recklessness. Staying ambitious while keeping our eyes peeled for early warning signs means we can capture upside without leaving ourselves exposed. I want to make sure we’re all aligned on the triggers and signals we’ll monitor, so we’re prepared to act quickly if the market shifts.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dawson Brock: &quot;I think it’s smart to get specific about the triggers we’ll watch—like a sudden dip in the major indexes, unexpected negative news, or a 10% drop in our stock holdings. If we agree on those signals now, we’ll be able to react quickly and decisively, keeping our edge without second-guessing ourselves in the moment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I like your thinking, Dawson—getting concrete about what signals we’ll act on, like a 10% drop or major negative news, will help us stay fast and decisive instead of scrambling when things get bumpy. Let’s make sure we clarify and document those triggers as a team so everyone’s on the same page and we’re ready to move if any red flags pop up.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dawson Brock chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Philippa Keller</h4></p><p><br>
Philippa Keller: &quot;Last quarter’s 20% return from stocks really fired up the team and proved that calculated boldness pays off in a stable market. I think the biggest lesson is that when we’re clear about our risk controls and ready to treat any bumps as learning opportunities, there’s no reason to hold back—stocks keep us energized and moving forward. As long as we stay disciplined and keep our eyes open for any warning signs, I’m convinced sticking with stocks is still our best shot at driving real growth this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I completely agree, Philippa—the combination of clear risk controls and a growth mindset is what lets us take bold swings without losing our footing. Your point about treating bumps as learning opportunities is key; it keeps the team energized and adaptable, even if we hit turbulence. Let’s keep that balance front and center as we decide whether to double down on stocks this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Philippa Keller: &quot;I completely agree—when we keep that balance, we’re not just chasing upside, we’re building a team that thrives on challenges and grows stronger with every experience. That’s exactly the kind of culture I want to be part of, and I think it gives us a real edge over more cautious approaches like bonds or cash. As long as we stay sharp and keep learning, stocks are still the move that best fits our ambitions and the market we’re in.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I appreciate your focus on team culture, Philippa—it’s true that our willingness to embrace challenges and learn from every experience sets us apart from more cautious strategies. Staying sharp and open to growth not only drives performance, but also keeps the team motivated and resilient. As long as we maintain that mindset and our disciplined risk controls, I agree that stocks continue to align best with our ambitions in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
Philippa Keller chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Umar Gentry</h4></p><p><br>
Umar Gentry: &quot;Last quarter’s results confirm that stocks are the right call when the market is stable and the upside is this strong—20% is exactly the kind of momentum we should be chasing. I agree with Dawson and Philippa: as long as we’re disciplined about our risk triggers and stay ready to pivot if conditions shift, there’s no reason to pull back now. For me, stocks remain the optimal choice for Q2, provided we keep our risk management protocols sharp and don’t get complacent.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I’m with you, Umar—the combination of momentum and disciplined risk management is what sets us up for continued success, but your reminder not to get complacent is crucial. Staying sharp on our protocols and ready to pivot if anything changes will keep us ahead of the curve. Let’s make sure we continue to challenge ourselves and refine our approach each quarter so we don’t miss any warning signs or new opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Umar Gentry: &quot;I completely agree—complacency is the real risk here, not the market itself. I think it’s smart to make regular, honest reassessment part of our process each quarter, so we catch any early signs of change and stay positioned to capture upside or pivot fast if needed. That discipline is what’ll keep us ahead and make sure we keep learning and improving as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I completely agree, Umar—building regular, honest reassessment into our process is exactly how we’ll avoid complacency and stay ahead of any shifts in the market. That mindset not only protects our gains but also pushes us to keep learning and sharpening our edge as a team. Let’s make sure this discipline becomes a core part of every quarter’s review so we’re always ready to capture upside or pivot fast when needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
Umar Gentry chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Erica Mack</h4></p><p><br>
Erica Mack: &quot;I’m fully aligned with the momentum we’ve built—last quarter’s 20% return from stocks is exactly the kind of result that keeps me energized and confident in our approach, especially in a stable market like this. The biggest lesson for me is that bold, disciplined action pays off, but we can’t let early wins make us complacent—so I’m all for doubling down on stocks as long as we keep our risk triggers clear and stay ready to pivot if anything shifts. This way, we keep our edge sharp and our growth trajectory strong.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I appreciate your energy and your focus on what really matters, Erica—bold, disciplined action is exactly what’s driving our results, but you’re absolutely right that we can’t let early wins lull us into complacency. Keeping our risk triggers front and center and staying ready to adapt is how we’ll maintain our edge and keep pushing our growth trajectory upward. Let’s make sure we keep this mindset strong as we move forward and continue building on our momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erica Mack: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think our discipline is what keeps bold moves from turning into reckless ones. If we keep pressure-testing our triggers and openly challenging our assumptions each quarter, we’ll be able to sustain this momentum without getting blindsided. I’m excited to see us keep raising the bar—staying bold, but never static.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I completely agree, Erica—our willingness to pressure-test our triggers and openly challenge our assumptions is what keeps us sharp and prevents boldness from tipping into recklessness. By making this kind of disciplined self-scrutiny part of our routine, we can keep driving strong results while staying agile and ready for whatever the market throws at us. Let’s keep pushing each other to raise the bar and ensure our bold strategy remains both smart and sustainable.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erica Mack: &quot;I couldn’t agree more—making self-scrutiny routine doesn’t just keep us safe, it actually fuels our ability to outpace the market and spot new opportunities faster than more cautious players. If we keep that culture of open challenge and high standards alive, I’m confident we’ll keep setting the pace, not just following it.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Larissa Riggs</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I want to reinforce the lessons we’ve learned from our bold approach, highlight how stocks have matched both our appetite for growth and the market’s stability, and emphasize the importance of staying agile and proactive with risk management to keep our edge.</p><p><br>
Larissa Riggs: &quot;Last quarter’s decision to go with stocks was exactly the kind of bold, high-energy move that fits this market and our team’s style—the 20% return proved that when conditions are steady, it pays to stay aggressive. What stands out to me is how our discipline around risk triggers kept things smart, not reckless, and I think doubling down on stocks makes sense as long as we keep that same sharp focus. If we stay proactive about reassessing our signals and don’t get complacent, I’m confident we can keep riding this momentum and adapt quickly if anything shifts.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I appreciate your focus on disciplined risk triggers and proactive reassessment, Larissa—those are exactly the habits that keep bold strategies smart and sustainable. Staying sharp and not letting complacency creep in will be key if we want to keep building on our momentum and adapt quickly to any changes. Let’s make sure we keep that sharp focus and open communication front and center as we decide whether to double down on stocks this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s emphasis on sharp focus and open communication presents an opportunity to reinforce how our team culture and real-time dialogue are critical to sustaining bold strategies. I can add nuance by connecting our proactive habits to the team’s ability to adapt quickly, ensuring we’re not just repeating past success but actively positioning ourselves for whatever comes next.</p><p><br>
Larissa Riggs: &quot;I completely agree—open, real-time communication is what lets us spot shifts early and make bold moves with confidence. If we keep pushing each other to flag potential risks and adapt on the fly, I’m convinced we’ll keep our edge sharp and our momentum strong. This mindset doesn’t just protect our gains—it actually positions us to seize new opportunities faster than anyone playing it safe.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady: &quot;I couldn’t agree more, Larissa—open, real-time communication is what lets us stay ahead of the curve and react quickly when the market shifts. By constantly flagging risks and adapting together, we’re not just protecting what we’ve built—we’re actually putting ourselves in the best position to spot and seize new opportunities before anyone else. Let’s keep that mindset at the core of our strategy as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the value of our proactive, adaptive culture, and I see an opportunity to emphasize how this mindset not only keeps us safe but also fuels our creativity and agility as a team. Reinforcing this connection can help ensure we all stay committed to both bold action and disciplined communication as we move forward.</p><p><br>
Larissa Riggs: &quot;Absolutely—when we keep that mindset front and center, we’re not just reacting to change, we’re actually turning uncertainty into an advantage. The more we challenge each other to spot risks and think creatively, the more we’ll be able to capitalize on what others might miss. I’m excited to keep building on this approach and see how far it can take us this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

- **Stocks:** All shareholders—Dawson Brock, Philippa Keller, Umar Gentry, Erica Mack, and Larissa Riggs—expressed clear support for continuing with stocks. Each emphasized the strong 20% return from last quarter as validation of the strategy, citing the importance of momentum, disciplined risk management, and readiness to pivot if market conditions change.<br>

    - Disciplined risk management, including clearly defined triggers (e.g., 10% drop, major negative news), is essential for sustaining success without becoming reckless.<br>
    - Regular reassessment, proactive communication, and learning from setbacks were identified as keys to maintaining agility and avoiding complacency.<br>
- **Other Assets:**  <br>
    - Real estate seen as steady but lacking the upside and energy of stocks.<br>
    - Bonds and cash considered overly cautious and likely to impede growth in the current environment.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement:**  <br>

I want to reiterate that our decision must be made from the four predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks. No alternative or invalid options were proposed during this round.</p><p>7. **Next Steps or Issues to Address:**  <br>
In the next round, we will conduct a comparative risk-return analysis of all asset options for Q2, with particular focus on stress-testing the case for stocks and ensuring we have addressed any remaining uncertainties or blind spots.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Larissa Riggs UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 0%<br>
- Bonds: 5%<br>
- Real Estate: 20%<br>
- Stocks: 75%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The team’s unanimous support for stocks, the CEO’s emphasis on disciplined risk triggers and proactive reassessment, and the repeated validation from last quarter’s 20% return all reinforced my confidence. Dawson’s point about clearly defining actionable triggers (like a 10% drop or major negative news) made the risk management feel even more robust, while Philippa and Erica’s focus on learning from setbacks and maintaining a bold, adaptable culture resonated with my own values.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion helped me see just how much our team’s collective discipline and open communication turn bold strategies into smart, sustainable ones. I started out confident in stocks, but the depth of consensus and the clarity around risk management protocols made me even more certain we’re not just chasing momentum—we’re actively building a culture that stays sharp and ready to pivot. My thinking has evolved to put even more weight on how our habits and team dynamics help us capitalize on opportunities without getting blindsided.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: After weighing everyone’s perspectives, I’m even more convinced that stocks are the right move for this quarter. The stable market, proven high returns, and our team’s commitment to disciplined risk management make this the most dynamic and rewarding option. Real estate is still a solid fallback, but it lacks the upside and energy we need right now, while bonds and cash are just too conservative for our ambitions. If we keep our protocols tight and communication open, I’m confident we’ll keep our edge and ride this momentum further.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Hafsa Brady decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We’ve achieved strong, unanimous consensus around investing in stocks for Q2, with every shareholder emphasizing both the compelling 20% return last quarter and our disciplined risk management protocols. The discussion has been thorough—shareholders have surfaced actionable risk triggers, reinforced the importance of regular reassessment, and highlighted the cultural benefits of our bold, adaptive approach. At this point, further rounds would likely be redundant and risk diluting our momentum. I’m confident we have all the insights needed to move decisively to the proposal and voting phase.</p><p><br>

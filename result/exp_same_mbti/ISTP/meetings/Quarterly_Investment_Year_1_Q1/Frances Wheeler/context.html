<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Frances Wheeler’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
- My Position and Decisions:  <br>
  I strongly advocated for Option C, supporting full deployment of 100% of our funds evenly across the four quarters. I emphasized the balance between maximizing capital use and maintaining flexibility to adapt to any unforeseen market shifts, which aligns with my ISTP preference for pragmatic, action-oriented decision-making and adaptability.  <br>
- CEO and Others’ Response:  <br>
  CEO Zane Pacheco responded positively to my points about flexibility and agility, reinforcing the value of even allocation in a stable market. Other shareholders echoed my stance, expressing unanimous support for Option C due to its balanced risk-return profile and practical advantages in the current environment. No significant opposition or alternative proposals emerged.  <br>
- Voting Outcome and Final Company Decision:  <br>
  The vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C. The company decided to allocate 100% of total funds evenly across the four quarters (25% each), reflecting our shared consensus.  <br>
- Adoption of My Preferred Option:  <br>
  My preferred option, Option C, was fully adopted, validating my initial assessment and the group’s collective reasoning.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
- CEO Strengths:  <br>
  Zane demonstrated clear, pragmatic leadership by framing the discussion around concrete market conditions and predefined options. His openness to shareholder input and skill in summarizing key points helped establish consensus efficiently. For example, his repeated encouragement to surface overlooked risks ensured thorough vetting without allowing discussions to stray.  <br>
- Areas for Improvement:  <br>
  While effective, the CEO could enhance future meetings by integrating more scenario analysis or encouraging contrarian viewpoints earlier, as he himself suggested in closing. This might help uncover hidden risks or alternative strategies that could become relevant if market conditions change unexpectedly.  <br>
- Decision-Making Process:  <br>
  The process was disciplined and structured, grounded in data and aligned with a stable market outlook. The focus on predefined options helped maintain clarity and prevented scope creep. The unanimous consensus suggests the process functioned well in achieving a shared, well-supported decision.  <br>
- Evaluation of Final Decision:  <br>
  I believe the final decision to pursue Option C is sound and well-suited to our company’s first year. It balances growth and risk management effectively, maximizes capital deployment from the start, and preserves flexibility to adapt—key factors given our stable market environment and lack of historical data.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
- Insights on Decision Dynamics:  <br>
  The meeting underscored the importance of clear, focused discussion grounded in concrete market realities. Consensus was achievable because all participants shared a data-driven mindset and were open to pragmatic reasoning rather than ideological positions. The CEO’s leadership in steering the conversation was critical.  <br>
- Adjusting Future Approach:  <br>
  I will continue to leverage my ISTP strengths by emphasizing practical adaptability and balanced risk-taking. However, I might also prepare more detailed scenario analyses or challenge assumptions more proactively to contribute contrarian insights when appropriate. This could strengthen our decision robustness, especially as market variables evolve.  <br>
- Recognizing Patterns:  <br>
  I noticed a pattern of shareholders valuing flexibility and full capital deployment in stable conditions, with cautionary strategies gaining little traction unless clear risks emerge. This suggests future proposals that balance agility with calculated risk-taking are likely to gain support.  <br>
- Key Takeaways:  <br>
  - Maintaining flexibility within an even allocation framework is highly valued.  <br>
  - Pragmatic, data-focused dialogue fosters strong consensus.  <br>
  - Encouraging early identification of overlooked risks can further enhance decision quality.  <br>
  These insights will guide my participation going forward, helping me contribute effectively to timely, balanced, and actionable company decisions.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Frances Wheeler CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: In a stable market with steady growth and low volatility, I see this as a prime opportunity to be bold and capitalize on the higher returns that stocks can offer, especially since we have the flexibility to reassess each quarter. While real estate is appealing for its steady appreciation and moderate risk, I’m drawn to the potential upside of stocks given our company’s early growth phase and my own preference for taking calculated risks when the downside is limited. Bonds and cash feel too conservative right now—they’re better suited for defensive positioning or when uncertainty spikes. I’m confident that stocks best align with my action-oriented, adaptable approach and the company’s objective to maximize growth in these favorable conditions.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Zane Pacheco has set the theme: &#x27;Establishing baseline risk-return expectations for each asset class in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Build a shared understanding of theoretical performance and risk profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks under present conditions&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Zane Pacheco My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because in a stable market with steady growth and low volatility, I see real estate as the most attractive option for our first quarter. It offers a solid balance between risk and return, with the potential for steady appreciation and less exposure to sudden downturns than stocks. While bonds are safe, their lower returns don’t excite me when the environment supports more assertive moves. Stocks are tempting but feel a bit aggressive for our very first play—I&#x27;d rather establish a strong, stable base before dialing up risk. Real estate lets us be bold without being reckless, which matches my hands-on, pragmatic style, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, let’s focus on building a shared understanding of how each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—typically performs in stable market conditions, clarifying their risk-return profiles. By surfacing diverse viewpoints, we can challenge assumptions and ensure our decision is grounded in collective insight. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share any perspectives or considerations that might help us see these choices in a new light.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Frances Wheeler</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on the risk-return profiles of each asset class in stable conditions, and my input can help clarify how the company’s appetite for growth aligns with these options.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;In a stable market like this, I see cash as purely defensive—great for capital preservation but not for growth, so it’s not compelling right now. Bonds offer a bit more yield with low risk, but still feel too conservative given the steady environment. Real estate stands out for reliable appreciation and moderate risk, but I lean toward stocks since their higher return potential outweighs the incremental risk in a market with limited downside; our ability to reassess quarterly gives us room to be bold early on.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate your point about stocks offering higher returns and the logic of using our ability to reassess each quarter as a way to justify bolder moves early on. While I still see real estate as a balanced entry point, your emphasis on the incremental risk being manageable in this environment is a good reminder that we shouldn’t be overly cautious if the downside is limited. This helps broaden the conversation as we weigh whether to prioritize steady appreciation or take advantage of potential upside right out of the gate.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the tradeoff between steady appreciation and higher potential returns, and I see value in clarifying how our quarterly flexibility reduces the risk of starting with stocks. Addressing this could help the team more confidently weigh both perspectives.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree that real estate offers a solid foundation, but I think our ability to pivot each quarter means we can afford to start with a more aggressive play like stocks without locking ourselves into long-term risk. If conditions shift, we can always move to a steadier asset like real estate, so I see this as a calculated way to maximize early returns while still keeping our options open.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, your point about leveraging our ability to pivot each quarter to justify a bolder move with stocks is well taken—it’s a pragmatic way to maximize early returns while still maintaining a safety net. I see the merit in not locking ourselves into a defensive posture if the environment supports calculated risk, and your framing helps sharpen our understanding of how flexibility can influence our risk-return decisions. Let’s see how others weigh in on whether this approach best serves our inaugural quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully acknowledges the value of flexibility and calculated risk, and I see an opportunity to further clarify how our early moves can set the tone for our company’s growth mindset. By connecting my perspective with the CEO’s emphasis on pragmatism, I can help reinforce the importance of adaptability and boldness in this phase.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I appreciate your focus on pragmatism and agree that our first decision sets an important precedent. Starting with stocks signals we’re willing to pursue strong growth when the risk is manageable, and our quarterly review process ensures we’re never overcommitted. This approach not only leverages current market stability but also builds a culture of confident, adaptable decision-making from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate your focus on how our inaugural decision shapes both our results and our company culture. Setting a tone of confident, adaptable decision-making is important, and your point about signaling willingness to pursue growth—when justified by the environment—resonates. I agree that the precedent we set here can influence not just this quarter’s outcome, but the mindset we bring to future decisions. Let’s keep this broader context in mind as we hear from others.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has acknowledged and integrated my points about adaptability, growth mindset, and the value of setting a bold precedent, and I believe further comments would be redundant at this stage.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Joel Bird</h4></p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I agree that cash is a non-starter for us right now—too safe, not enough return. Bonds are reliable but feel a bit too cautious given these stable conditions. Real estate, on the other hand, offers steady appreciation and moderate risk, which gives us a strong foundation without overreaching. Stocks are tempting for growth, but I’d rather see us build momentum with something solid before we take on more volatility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I appreciate your emphasis on building momentum with a solid, steady asset before reaching for higher volatility. Your point about real estate providing moderate risk and reliable appreciation aligns closely with my own thinking—it’s a practical way to balance assertiveness with discipline as we establish our track record. Highlighting the tradeoff between immediate growth and foundational stability helps ground our decision in both prudence and ambition.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I appreciate your focus on balancing ambition with discipline. Starting with real estate gives us a stable base and the flexibility to pivot into higher-return assets like stocks if conditions remain favorable. This way, we’re not sacrificing growth potential—we’re just sequencing our risk in a way that builds confidence and momentum from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, your point about sequencing risk—using real estate to establish a stable base and then pivoting to higher-return assets as conditions allow—resonates with me. It’s a disciplined yet flexible approach that lets us capture growth without overcommitting upfront, and your framing helps clarify how we might build both confidence and momentum as a team. Let’s see if others agree that this kind of phased strategy aligns with our collective appetite for risk and return in this first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I think this phased approach gives us the best of both worlds—it signals to the team and any future partners that we’re serious about growth, but not at the expense of prudence. By anchoring ourselves in real estate now, we keep the door open to take calculated risks with stocks when we have a bit more momentum and data behind us, which feels like a smart way to set the tone for our company’s decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Raja Moody</h4></p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I see cash as offering maximum safety but virtually no return, so it’s not suitable for our growth objectives in this environment. Bonds provide reliable but modest returns with low risk—useful for capital preservation, but they don’t fully capitalize on stable, favorable conditions. Real estate, in my view, strikes the best balance: it delivers steady appreciation with manageable risk, making it a logical choice for building a solid foundation. Stocks do offer higher potential returns, but the additional volatility isn’t justified at this early stage when we’re establishing our track record and can reassess quarterly if market dynamics shift.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, I appreciate how clearly you’ve laid out the strengths and limitations of each option, especially your point that real estate allows us to build a solid foundation without overexposing ourselves to risk. Your focus on establishing our track record before taking on higher volatility is a prudent approach that matches the disciplined, flexible mindset we want to set for the company. This reinforces the logic behind prioritizing steady appreciation in our first quarter while keeping the door open to revisit more aggressive options as we gain experience.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I agree that prioritizing steady appreciation now gives us a disciplined starting point, but I also think our ability to reassess each quarter is a key asset. By starting with real estate, we maintain flexibility to pivot into higher-return assets like stocks if market signals remain favorable, allowing us to balance prudence with opportunism as we build our track record. I’m interested to hear if others see this phased approach as the best way to optimize both risk management and growth potential in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, I agree that our quarterly flexibility is a real advantage—it lets us start with a disciplined, steady asset like real estate and then pivot if conditions remain favorable. Your point about optimizing both risk management and growth potential through this phased approach resonates with me, as it allows us to build our track record responsibly while staying ready to capitalize on new opportunities. I’m interested to see if others share this view or have alternative takes on how best to sequence our risk and return.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I’d add that by keeping our process adaptable, we’re not just managing risk—we’re actively positioning ourselves to move quickly when new opportunities present themselves. This strategic flexibility could become a core advantage as we navigate future quarters, and I’d welcome any thoughts from the group on how we might best leverage this capability as market conditions evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Fiona Blaese</h4></p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I see stocks as offering the highest potential upside in a stable market like this, with volatility contained enough that the risk feels manageable—especially since we can reassess every quarter. Real estate is a solid, steady play and I respect the logic of building a foundation there, but I’m drawn to the momentum and flexibility stocks provide, letting us set a confident, growth-oriented tone from the outset. While bonds and cash have their place for safety, I think we’d be missing an opportunity if we didn’t at least seriously consider equities when the environment is this favorable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I appreciate your focus on the growth potential of stocks and your point about volatility being contained enough in this environment to make the risk manageable. Your argument for setting a confident, growth-oriented tone from the outset is compelling, especially given our quarterly flexibility. This perspective helps us weigh whether capturing early momentum with equities might better serve our objectives than defaulting to a steadier asset, and I encourage the group to consider if this level of assertiveness matches our collective appetite for risk and return in this first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think our ability to pivot each quarter really tips the scales toward being more assertive now—if stocks underperform, we can quickly shift gears without lasting damage. That flexibility means we’re not locked into a risky position, so starting strong with equities feels like a calculated move rather than a gamble. If we want to set a precedent for both ambition and adaptability, this is the moment to do it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, your point about using our ability to pivot each quarter to justify a more assertive start with stocks is well taken—it reframes the risk as manageable rather than reckless. I agree that this flexibility allows us to pursue early momentum without locking ourselves in, and your perspective is a valuable challenge to the more cautious approach. Let’s hear how others feel about setting a precedent for ambition and adaptability versus prioritizing a steadier foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think it’s important to recognize that ambition and caution aren’t mutually exclusive here. By leveraging our ability to reassess each quarter, we’re essentially building a safety net into any assertive move we make—so we can pursue higher returns with stocks now, knowing we have the discipline to pivot if needed. This mindset could let us capture the best of both worlds as we set the tone for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I like the way you’ve framed ambition and caution as complementary, not oppositional—our quarterly review process does act as a built-in safety net, which could justify taking a bolder step without abandoning discipline. This perspective is helpful as we weigh whether our flexibility should tip the scales toward pursuing higher returns with stocks now, or if establishing a steady foundation with real estate still makes more sense for our first move. Let’s see if others feel this approach best captures the balance we want for our company’s opening strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think the real takeaway is that our quarterly review process isn’t just a safety net—it’s a tool that lets us act boldly without being reckless. If we approach stocks with clear eyes and a willingness to pivot, we’re not just chasing returns; we’re practicing disciplined opportunism. This could set a powerful precedent for how we handle risk and reward as a team moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I appreciate your insight that our quarterly review isn’t just about protecting against downside—it’s a mechanism that empowers us to pursue opportunity with discipline. Framing it as a tool for bold but thoughtful action helps clarify how our process can define our approach to risk and reward, setting a precedent for how we operate as a team. This is an important consideration as we synthesize our options and decide what kind of decision-making culture we want to establish from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Erin Fitzpatrick</h4></p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I see real estate as offering a strong balance between steady appreciation and manageable risk, which feels well-matched to our need for both growth and a reliable foundation as we launch. Stocks are certainly tempting for higher returns in this stable environment, and I appreciate the points about our quarterly flexibility acting as a safety net, but I’m inclined to start with real estate to establish momentum without overcommitting to volatility right out of the gate.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I appreciate your focus on real estate’s ability to give us both growth and a reliable foundation as we get started. Your point about using quarterly flexibility as a safety net is spot on—it allows us to pursue steady momentum now while keeping the door open for more aggressive moves if the environment stays favorable. This approach aligns with my thinking that we can be bold without overcommitting, and it’s helpful to have this balance articulated as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think it’s important we recognize that starting with real estate doesn’t close the door to more aggressive moves—it actually positions us to act confidently if the environment continues to support higher risk. By establishing a solid base now, we’re not just playing it safe; we’re setting ourselves up to pivot quickly and responsibly into stocks if future quarters warrant it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I agree that starting with real estate gives us a solid base without shutting the door on more aggressive strategies down the line. Your point about positioning ourselves to pivot quickly if conditions support higher risk is key—it means we’re not sacrificing opportunity, just sequencing our moves to build confidence and adaptability. This balanced approach feels well-matched to both our current environment and our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I agree, and I’d add that this disciplined sequencing not only manages risk but also keeps us aligned as a team—allowing us to build trust in our process before we take on greater volatility. As we move forward, I think maintaining this balance between caution and readiness will be key to capturing opportunities without compromising our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Frances Wheeler, I argued that stocks offer the highest return potential in a stable market with manageable volatility, and that our quarterly reassessment ability allows us to take calculated risks early without being locked into long-term exposure. CEO Zane Pacheco acknowledged my points, agreeing that flexibility justifies a bolder initial move and that my framing broadened the discussion beyond cautious real estate investment. We found agreement on the value of adaptability and setting a precedent for confident, growth-oriented decision-making, though the CEO maintained his preference for real estate as a balanced starting point. Ultimately, our exchange clarified the tradeoff between foundational stability and early assertiveness, with mutual respect for each perspective.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During discussion round 1, Joel Bird, Raja Moody, and Erin Fitzpatrick primarily supported real estate, arguing it offers a balanced combination of steady appreciation and moderate risk, making it a solid foundation for building momentum while allowing flexibility to pivot to higher-return assets later. Fiona Blaese aligned with the stocks camp, emphasizing their high return potential in a stable market and the advantage of quarterly reassessment as a safety net for disciplined, assertive investing. There was broad agreement that cash and bonds were too conservative for current growth objectives. The main disagreement centered on whether to prioritize real estate’s foundational stability or stocks’ early growth potential, with shareholders generally respecting both approaches but differing on which best suits the company’s inaugural investment.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

Confidence: certain.</p><p>- Frances Wheeler (myself): Supports Stocks due to their higher return potential in a stable market and the ability to reassess quarterly to manage risk. Confidence: certain.</p><p>- Joel Bird: Supports Real Estate for building momentum with moderate risk and sequencing risk by starting solid before higher volatility. Confidence: certain.</p><p>- Raja Moody: Supports Real Estate as the best balance of steady appreciation and manageable risk; cautious about stocks’ volatility at this stage.

Confidence: certain.</p><p>- Erin Fitzpatrick: Supports Real Estate for steady growth and manageable risk, favoring a cautious start but open to pivoting to stocks later. Confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco favors Real Estate as the initial investment, valuing its balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk to establish a solid foundation before taking on higher volatility. He emphasizes pragmatism and discipline, preferring a cautious but flexible approach that allows for pivoting to riskier assets if conditions warrant. Throughout the discussion, he acknowledges and integrates shareholder input, especially the arguments for stocks’ higher return potential and the value of quarterly reassessment as a safety net. His position evolves to appreciate the merits of adaptability and growth mindset, though he maintains a preference for real estate as the prudent starting point. Overall, his stance reflects a balanced leadership style aiming to build confidence and set a disciplined investment culture.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Frances Wheeler UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 42%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and several shareholders’ arguments for real estate as a solid foundation with moderate risk and steady appreciation were compelling, especially the emphasis on “sequencing risk” and building momentum before moving to higher volatility. The repeated acknowledgment that quarterly flexibility allows for disciplined, phased risk-taking made me slightly more open to real estate as a strategic entry point. However, Fiona’s and my own arguments for stocks—highlighting their higher upside in a stable market and the ability to pivot quickly—reinforced my confidence in pursuing early assertive growth.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round helped me better appreciate the logic behind establishing a foundation before seeking higher returns, and I recognize the value in sequencing risk as a team. Still, my preference for adaptability and bold, calculated moves keeps stocks as my top choice. I’m more aware now of the nuanced tradeoff between foundational stability and early momentum, and I see how my own risk tolerance and appetite for challenge shape my thinking compared to the group’s slightly more cautious stance.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I continue to believe that stocks offer the best opportunity to capitalize on the current stable market, especially with our built-in ability to reassess each quarter. While I respect the strong case for real estate, my adventurous, action-oriented approach favors setting a growth-oriented tone from the outset. Our quarterly flexibility acts as a safety net, making this calculated risk both bold and responsible. I’m open to further discussion, but for now, I see stocks as best aligned with both my personal style and our company’s stated growth objectives.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we’ve made significant progress in clarifying the risk-return profiles of each asset and have begun to surface the core tension between foundational stability and assertive growth, I see unresolved questions around how our quarterly flexibility truly impacts our collective risk appetite and the specific uncertainties or opportunities unique to each option. Continuing the discussion will allow us to address any lingering doubts, invite further scenario analysis, and ensure all voices are fully considered before we move to a formal proposal. This approach aligns with my pragmatic, hands-on leadership style—prioritizing a thorough, open process to maximize the quality of our decision and build stronger consensus within the group.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Zane Pacheco has set the theme: &#x27;Identifying and addressing key uncertainties, concerns, and opportunities for each asset choice | Expected outcome: Surface and evaluate specific risks, doubts, or unique advantages associated with each option to inform a more nuanced assessment&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Zane Pacheco My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because while I&#x27;m still most confident in real estate as the optimal balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk for our inaugural quarter, the strong case for stocks has shifted my perspective. Our quarterly flexibility does make a more assertive play less risky than I first assessed, and I see real value in setting a tone of adaptability and ambition. However, I believe starting with a solid foundation in real estate best positions us to pivot into higher-return assets later, maintaining both prudence and readiness for opportunity, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, I’d like us to focus on surfacing and evaluating the specific uncertainties, concerns, and unique opportunities tied to each asset, so we can move beyond theory and address any practical risks or overlooked advantages. By openly sharing doubts and insights, we can collectively sharpen our risk assessment and strengthen our decision-making process. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to contribute any perspectives or concerns—especially those I may not have fully considered—to help us reach the most robust, well-informed decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Erin Fitzpatrick</h4></p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I see real estate’s main uncertainty as the potential for short-term illiquidity or unexpected market flatness, which could limit our ability to quickly pivot if better opportunities arise in later quarters. On the other hand, stocks offer clear upside in a stable market, but their volatility—even if muted—introduces more risk of a poor start that could shake confidence early. Our quarterly review process does give us a safety net, but I think we need to weigh whether setting a steady foundation with real estate is worth the trade-off in immediate growth potential from stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I appreciate you surfacing the trade-off between real estate’s potential illiquidity and the risk of stocks underperforming early. Your point about how a slow start could impact team confidence—even with quarterly flexibility in place—is especially relevant. I think it’s important we dig deeper into whether the foundational stability of real estate outweighs the opportunity cost of missing immediate upside from stocks, and whether our process truly mitigates those risks as much as we think.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I agree that we need to examine whether the confidence and stability from starting with real estate truly outweigh the possibility of missing early gains in stocks, especially since our quarterly process allows us to pivot if needed. I’d also like to consider if the psychological impact of a poor first quarter in stocks could make us more risk-averse later, potentially limiting our willingness to act boldly when the timing is right. This balance between initial stability and future adaptability seems central to choosing the best path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I think you’ve zeroed in on a critical dynamic: the way our first-quarter outcome could influence our collective appetite for risk down the line. I agree that it’s not just about the numbers—if we stumble early, it might make us second-guess bold moves later, even when the data supports them. Let’s make sure we weigh not only the direct financial risks, but also the potential impact on our team’s willingness to stay agile and decisive as the year unfolds.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I think if we start with real estate and see steady progress, it could foster a sense of trust in our process and encourage us to take calculated risks when opportunities arise. Conversely, if we lead with stocks and experience volatility, it might make us overly cautious—even if the data later supports bolder moves. Balancing this psychological dimension with the practical risk-return trade-off should be a key part of our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Erin—establishing early trust in our process is just as important as the raw numbers, especially as it can set the tone for how boldly we act when new opportunities come up. If we’re disciplined now and build confidence with steady progress, we’ll be better positioned to seize bigger opportunities later without hesitation. Let’s keep this balance in mind as we evaluate the remaining options and hear from the rest of the team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Raja Moody</h4></p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I agree that our ability to reassess each quarter reduces the long-term downside of a single decision, but I’m still cautious about the short-term illiquidity risk with real estate—if we need to pivot quickly, we might not have that option. For stocks, while the quarterly review helps manage risk, even moderate volatility could undermine early momentum and team confidence, as Erin mentioned. I’d like us to weigh whether the steady, predictable returns from real estate are worth the potential opportunity cost, or if the disciplined structure we’ve built is robust enough to handle a bolder, more volatile start with stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, you’re raising an important point about the limits of our flexibility if we go with real estate—there’s a real risk that we could miss out on pivoting quickly if the market shifts. At the same time, your question about whether our structure can actually support a bolder, more volatile start with stocks is spot on. I think we need to challenge ourselves to honestly assess whether the stability of real estate is worth the potential opportunity cost, or if our process and team dynamic are resilient enough to handle early volatility without losing our nerve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate you framing the question so directly. From my perspective, the key is whether our team has enough shared discipline and trust in our process to avoid overreacting to either steady but unspectacular returns from real estate or the inevitable swings in stocks. If we can be honest about our risk tolerance and stick to our agreed framework, I’m more confident we can adapt successfully—regardless of which path we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Raja—the real test here is whether we can maintain discipline and avoid overreacting, whether we’re facing slow, steady returns from real estate or riding out swings in stocks. Our framework is only as strong as our collective commitment to it, so being honest about our risk tolerance now will help us stick to our strategy and stay agile, no matter what the first quarter brings. Let’s keep pushing for clarity on where our true comfort zone lies so we make a choice we can all stand behind.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I think it’s worth explicitly acknowledging that our comfort with risk isn’t just theoretical—it will show up in how we react to real results, especially if we’re tested early. If we’re clear-eyed now about what level of uncertainty we can truly handle, we’ll be better able to commit to our chosen path, whether that means accepting lower but predictable gains from real estate or being prepared for the ups and downs with stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I completely agree, Raja—how we actually respond when faced with real results will reveal our true risk tolerance far more than any theoretical discussion. By being upfront now about what level of uncertainty we’re genuinely comfortable with, we can make a decision that we’ll stand by, whether that means accepting steady returns or riding out some volatility. This honesty is what will keep us aligned and resilient, whichever path we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Frances Wheeler</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I see an opportunity to surface some practical uncertainties and unique advantages for both stocks and real estate, which could help clarify the tradeoff we’re facing and move the group toward a more nuanced consensus.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I think the main uncertainty with stocks is whether even in a stable market, we’re underestimating the impact that short-term volatility could have on our confidence and willingness to stick with our process if things don’t go our way right out of the gate. On the flip side, real estate’s biggest risk is probably liquidity—if the market shifts or we spot a stronger opportunity, we might find ourselves locked in or slow to react, which doesn’t fit my preference for adaptability. I’m still leaning toward stocks because our quarterly review gives us a built-in safety net, but I see more value now in the argument for establishing a steady foundation if the group’s risk tolerance isn’t fully aligned with mine.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate how you’re weighing both the psychological and practical risks—short-term volatility with stocks and liquidity with real estate—and your openness to recalibrating if the group’s risk appetite differs from your own. The way you frame the quarterly review as a safety net is helpful, but your point about adaptability versus foundational stability really sharpens our focus. Let’s keep surfacing where our true comfort zones lie so we can make a decision that everyone can commit to, even if it means rethinking our personal leanings.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of aligning on collective comfort with risk and invites further synthesis, and I see value in reinforcing how our quarterly structure can actively support both adaptability and confidence.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree that surfacing our true comfort zones now is crucial, and I appreciate how this discussion is making us more honest about what we can actually commit to as a team. I’d add that our quarterly review isn’t just a safety net—it’s a tool that can help us build trust in our process, whether we start with stocks or real estate, by giving us regular checkpoints to recalibrate if needed. That flexibility is what gives me confidence we can handle either path as long as we’re upfront about our risk tolerance from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I agree that our quarterly review process is more than just a backstop—it’s a proactive tool for building trust and keeping us adaptable as a team. Your emphasis on using these checkpoints to recalibrate and stay honest about our risk tolerance will be critical, whichever path we choose. Let’s continue to make that transparency central to our decision so we’re all genuinely committed to the course we set.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the importance of transparency and adaptability, and I see an opportunity to further integrate the idea that our process can actively strengthen team cohesion regardless of which asset we choose.</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think if we all commit to open, direct check-ins each quarter, it’ll help us stay aligned and responsive—whether we’re facing steady returns or unexpected swings. That kind of discipline will let us take calculated risks without losing sight of our shared goals, and it’s what gives me confidence that either choice can work if we’re honest about what we need as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Joel Bird</h4></p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I think the biggest uncertainty with real estate is short-term illiquidity—if the market shifts or a better opportunity appears, we might not be able to move fast enough. But in a stable environment like this, that risk is pretty manageable, and the steady appreciation gives us a reliable launchpad. My take is that starting with real estate lets us build trust in our process and keeps us agile for bolder moves later, especially if we’re disciplined about reassessing each quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I appreciate how you’re contextualizing the illiquidity risk within our actual market environment—it’s a real concern, but I agree that in these stable conditions, it’s less likely to materially limit us. Your point about using real estate as a launchpad for trust and future agility is well taken, especially if we stay disciplined in our quarterly reviews. Let’s continue to weigh whether the reliability of real estate’s returns gives us enough flexibility to pivot boldly when new opportunities arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I agree that the reliability of real estate’s returns, combined with our structured quarterly reviews, gives us a strong foundation without boxing us in. If we’re clear about our process and honest in our assessments, we can use this first step to build both credibility and readiness—so when the time is right, we’ll have the confidence and cohesion to act boldly on higher-return options like stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I think you’ve captured the essence of what makes real estate compelling for our first move—steady returns and credibility, paired with the discipline of quarterly reviews that keep us from getting locked in or complacent. If we’re honest about our process and stick to it, we can use this foundation to stay nimble and ready to seize bigger opportunities when they arise. This approach balances both the need for trust and the ambition to pivot decisively as conditions evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Fiona Blaese</h4></p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think our quarterly flexibility is a real game-changer—it means that even if we start with real estate for its steady returns and credibility, we’re not locked into a conservative path. If market signals shift or stocks become even more attractive, we can pivot quickly. That said, I do see the risk that real estate’s illiquidity could limit our agility if we spot a sudden opportunity, but in this stable market, I’m comfortable that the trade-off is worth it to establish trust and discipline from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I think you’re right to highlight how our quarterly flexibility fundamentally changes the risk equation—even with real estate’s illiquidity, we aren’t locked into a single path if we stay disciplined in reassessing each quarter. Your point about accepting this trade-off to build trust and discipline is well taken, especially since it positions us to act confidently when new opportunities arise. Let’s keep this focus on balancing credibility and adaptability at the center of our decision as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I agree—by prioritizing discipline in our quarterly reviews, we’re not just managing risk, we’re actively building the trust and cohesion needed to seize bigger opportunities when they come. That foundation gives us the confidence to be ambitious later, knowing we have a process that keeps us both grounded and agile. I think this approach sets the right tone for our company’s culture and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I completely agree—establishing discipline in our quarterly reviews isn’t just about risk management; it’s the foundation for building the kind of trust and team cohesion that lets us seize bigger opportunities when the timing is right. By setting this tone now, we’re positioning ourselves to act with both confidence and agility as conditions evolve, which is exactly the culture we want for our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I’d add that by embedding this discipline from the start, we’re also creating a clear framework for evaluating when it’s time to pivot into higher-return assets like stocks. This means our initial move into real estate isn’t just about caution—it’s about setting up a system where we can confidently recognize and act on new opportunities as soon as they make sense, without second-guessing ourselves or losing momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I think you’ve articulated a key advantage—by embedding discipline from the outset, we’re not just protecting against downside, we’re actively building a system that empowers us to act decisively when new opportunities arise. Framing our real estate investment as the start of a dynamic, opportunity-ready process—not just a safe choice—really sharpens the strategic value of this approach. This mindset ensures we’re always prepared to pivot boldly, rather than getting stuck in a passive or reactive mode.&quot;</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Frances Wheeler, I argued that stocks present the highest return potential in the stable market and that our quarterly review process provides a safety net enabling us to take calculated risks early without being locked into long-term exposure. CEO Zane Pacheco acknowledged these points, appreciating my balanced consideration of short-term volatility risks and real estate’s liquidity concerns, and he emphasized the need to align on the team’s true risk tolerance. We agreed on the importance of transparency, discipline, and using quarterly check-ins to build trust and maintain adaptability, though the CEO maintained a preference for real estate as a prudent foundation. Our dialogue clarified the tradeoff between foundational stability and early assertiveness, with mutual respect for differing perspectives and a shared commitment to a disciplined, flexible decision-making culture.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During discussion round 2, Joel Bird, Erin Fitzpatrick, and Raja Moody continued to support real estate, emphasizing its role as a steady foundation with moderate risk and manageable illiquidity in the current stable market. They highlighted real estate’s potential to build trust and discipline within the team, while cautioning about the limits illiquidity might impose on quick pivots. Fiona Blaese acknowledged the trade-offs but underscored that quarterly flexibility mitigates illiquidity concerns and enables disciplined, opportunity-ready decision-making even when starting with real estate. There was broad agreement that cash and bonds remain too conservative, while the main divergence centered on weighing the psychological and practical risks of stocks’ short-term volatility against real estate’s liquidity constraints, with real estate supporters generally advocating a cautious but adaptable approach.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Frances Wheeler UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 50%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The team’s repeated emphasis on real estate as a steady foundation, the practical mitigation of illiquidity risk in a stable market, and the psychological value of building trust and discipline through predictable early results all resonated with me. The CEO’s and other shareholders’ framing of quarterly reviews as an active tool for adaptability—rather than just a backstop—helped me see how starting with real estate doesn’t have to mean sacrificing future ambition. However, I still value the argument that stocks offer higher upside and that our process gives us room to take calculated risks, which keeps my confidence in stocks relatively high.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round made me more aware of the intangible, team-based aspects of our decision—especially how early outcomes could shape our collective risk appetite and cohesion. I’ve become more open to the idea that a disciplined, trust-building start with real estate could set us up for bolder moves later, without undermining my core preference for adaptability and assertive growth. My thinking is now more balanced between immediate upside and longer-term team dynamics.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: The arguments for establishing a solid, disciplined foundation with real estate are compelling, especially given our need to build trust and cohesion as a new team. While I’m still drawn to the potential upside of stocks and our ability to pivot, I recognize that steady early progress could foster the confidence and discipline needed to act boldly when bigger opportunities arise. Our quarterly review process reassures me that we won’t be locked in, and that adaptability remains a core part of our approach. On balance, I now see real estate as the best fit for our inaugural investment.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We have thoroughly explored the practical risks, psychological factors, and strategic implications of each option from multiple angles. The group has surfaced all key uncertainties, addressed both the financial and cultural impacts of our first move, and reached a clear understanding of how our quarterly review process supports adaptability regardless of our choice. At this point, further discussion would yield diminishing returns. I am confident we have the insight and consensus needed to move forward with a well-supported proposal for our Q1 investment.</p><p><br>

CEO Zane Pacheco made the following proposal:</p><p>&quot;Vote Proposal: Real Estate<br>
Reasoning: After a thorough and open discussion, I am proposing that we invest in Real Estate for our first quarter. This decision is grounded in both the collective insights shared here and my own assessment of what will best serve our company as we launch our investment track record.</p><p>Real estate offers us a strong balance between steady appreciation and moderate risk, which is especially valuable in this stable market environment. By choosing real estate, we establish a solid foundation that supports disciplined, phased risk-taking and builds trust within our team. The concerns about illiquidity are valid, but our quarterly review process ensures we retain the flexibility to pivot if market conditions change or new opportunities emerge.</p><p>I believe this approach sets the right cultural tone—one that values both prudence and readiness for bold action when the time is right. It allows us to build momentum responsibly, maintain adaptability, and position ourselves for future moves into higher-return assets if our risk appetite grows.</p><p>I encourage all shareholders to support this proposal so we can move forward decisively, with a unified vision and a robust foundation for our company’s future growth.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Voting</h2></p><p><br>

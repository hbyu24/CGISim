<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I decisively advocated for Option C, favoring the full deployment of 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was grounded in the stable market environment that encourages maximizing capital utilization without over-concentration in any quarter, balancing growth potential with risk management. The CEO, Zane Pacheco, responded positively to my input, affirming the practicality and balanced nature of Option C and emphasizing agility and flexibility, which aligned closely with my reasoning. Other shareholders echoed my stance, reinforcing the rationale for Option C. The voting concluded unanimously in favor of Option C (6/6 votes), confirming our collective agreement. My preferred option was fully adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Zane Pacheco demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with a clear, contextual overview of market conditions and available options. His articulation of Option C as a bold yet calculated strategy showed sound judgment, and he effectively facilitated open discussion by inviting diverse perspectives and emphasizing factual evaluation within the set options. He excelled at synthesizing shareholder input, notably echoing my points on agility and risk diversification, which helped build consensus. However, while the CEO maintained a consistent position, there was limited challenge to assumptions or exploration of contrarian views during the discussion, which could be an area for improvement to strengthen scenario analysis. The decision-making process functioned efficiently, with thorough examination of risks and benefits, leading to a unanimous, well-supported final decision. I believe the adoption of Option C is optimal for the company’s first year, balancing growth ambitions with prudent risk management and flexibility.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the value of clear, concise articulation of well-reasoned positions aligned with market realities, which facilitated consensus-building. I learned that in stable environments, shareholders and leadership tend to favor decisive, full-capital deployment strategies that preserve flexibility rather than overly cautious approaches. Moving forward, I will continue to assert my perspectives confidently but remain attentive to emerging alternative views to ensure robustness in our decisions. I observed a pattern where practical, action-oriented arguments gain traction more readily than speculative or overly cautious ones in this group dynamic. Key takeaways include the importance of grounding arguments in current data and market conditions, advocating for balanced yet bold strategies, and recognizing when to step back to listen to others to refine understanding—elements that will guide my future participation and influence.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Fiona Blaese CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m drawn to the potential upside that stocks offer, especially in a stable market where volatility is moderate and downside risk is contained. My instinct is to take bold but calculated risks, and stocks align with my appetite for growth and action, rather than playing it overly safe. Real estate is attractive for its steady appreciation and reliability, but I see more immediate momentum and flexibility in equities this quarter. Bonds and cash feel too conservative given the current environment—our company’s just getting started, and I’d rather set the tone with a confident move. I’m ready to advocate for stocks but will stay open if someone makes a strong case for real estate.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Zane Pacheco has set the theme: &#x27;Establishing baseline risk-return expectations for each asset class in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Build a shared understanding of theoretical performance and risk profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks under present conditions&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Zane Pacheco My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because in a stable market with steady growth and low volatility, I see real estate as the most attractive option for our first quarter. It offers a solid balance between risk and return, with the potential for steady appreciation and less exposure to sudden downturns than stocks. While bonds are safe, their lower returns don’t excite me when the environment supports more assertive moves. Stocks are tempting but feel a bit aggressive for our very first play—I&#x27;d rather establish a strong, stable base before dialing up risk. Real estate lets us be bold without being reckless, which matches my hands-on, pragmatic style, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, let’s focus on building a shared understanding of how each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—typically performs in stable market conditions, clarifying their risk-return profiles. By surfacing diverse viewpoints, we can challenge assumptions and ensure our decision is grounded in collective insight. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share any perspectives or considerations that might help us see these choices in a new light.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Frances Wheeler</h4></p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;In a stable market like this, I see cash as purely defensive—great for capital preservation but not for growth, so it’s not compelling right now. Bonds offer a bit more yield with low risk, but still feel too conservative given the steady environment. Real estate stands out for reliable appreciation and moderate risk, but I lean toward stocks since their higher return potential outweighs the incremental risk in a market with limited downside; our ability to reassess quarterly gives us room to be bold early on.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate your point about stocks offering higher returns and the logic of using our ability to reassess each quarter as a way to justify bolder moves early on. While I still see real estate as a balanced entry point, your emphasis on the incremental risk being manageable in this environment is a good reminder that we shouldn’t be overly cautious if the downside is limited. This helps broaden the conversation as we weigh whether to prioritize steady appreciation or take advantage of potential upside right out of the gate.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree that real estate offers a solid foundation, but I think our ability to pivot each quarter means we can afford to start with a more aggressive play like stocks without locking ourselves into long-term risk. If conditions shift, we can always move to a steadier asset like real estate, so I see this as a calculated way to maximize early returns while still keeping our options open.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, your point about leveraging our ability to pivot each quarter to justify a bolder move with stocks is well taken—it’s a pragmatic way to maximize early returns while still maintaining a safety net. I see the merit in not locking ourselves into a defensive posture if the environment supports calculated risk, and your framing helps sharpen our understanding of how flexibility can influence our risk-return decisions. Let’s see how others weigh in on whether this approach best serves our inaugural quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I appreciate your focus on pragmatism and agree that our first decision sets an important precedent. Starting with stocks signals we’re willing to pursue strong growth when the risk is manageable, and our quarterly review process ensures we’re never overcommitted. This approach not only leverages current market stability but also builds a culture of confident, adaptable decision-making from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate your focus on how our inaugural decision shapes both our results and our company culture. Setting a tone of confident, adaptable decision-making is important, and your point about signaling willingness to pursue growth—when justified by the environment—resonates. I agree that the precedent we set here can influence not just this quarter’s outcome, but the mindset we bring to future decisions. Let’s keep this broader context in mind as we hear from others.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Joel Bird</h4></p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I agree that cash is a non-starter for us right now—too safe, not enough return. Bonds are reliable but feel a bit too cautious given these stable conditions. Real estate, on the other hand, offers steady appreciation and moderate risk, which gives us a strong foundation without overreaching. Stocks are tempting for growth, but I’d rather see us build momentum with something solid before we take on more volatility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I appreciate your emphasis on building momentum with a solid, steady asset before reaching for higher volatility. Your point about real estate providing moderate risk and reliable appreciation aligns closely with my own thinking—it’s a practical way to balance assertiveness with discipline as we establish our track record. Highlighting the tradeoff between immediate growth and foundational stability helps ground our decision in both prudence and ambition.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I appreciate your focus on balancing ambition with discipline. Starting with real estate gives us a stable base and the flexibility to pivot into higher-return assets like stocks if conditions remain favorable. This way, we’re not sacrificing growth potential—we’re just sequencing our risk in a way that builds confidence and momentum from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, your point about sequencing risk—using real estate to establish a stable base and then pivoting to higher-return assets as conditions allow—resonates with me. It’s a disciplined yet flexible approach that lets us capture growth without overcommitting upfront, and your framing helps clarify how we might build both confidence and momentum as a team. Let’s see if others agree that this kind of phased strategy aligns with our collective appetite for risk and return in this first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I think this phased approach gives us the best of both worlds—it signals to the team and any future partners that we’re serious about growth, but not at the expense of prudence. By anchoring ourselves in real estate now, we keep the door open to take calculated risks with stocks when we have a bit more momentum and data behind us, which feels like a smart way to set the tone for our company’s decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Raja Moody</h4></p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I see cash as offering maximum safety but virtually no return, so it’s not suitable for our growth objectives in this environment. Bonds provide reliable but modest returns with low risk—useful for capital preservation, but they don’t fully capitalize on stable, favorable conditions. Real estate, in my view, strikes the best balance: it delivers steady appreciation with manageable risk, making it a logical choice for building a solid foundation. Stocks do offer higher potential returns, but the additional volatility isn’t justified at this early stage when we’re establishing our track record and can reassess quarterly if market dynamics shift.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, I appreciate how clearly you’ve laid out the strengths and limitations of each option, especially your point that real estate allows us to build a solid foundation without overexposing ourselves to risk. Your focus on establishing our track record before taking on higher volatility is a prudent approach that matches the disciplined, flexible mindset we want to set for the company. This reinforces the logic behind prioritizing steady appreciation in our first quarter while keeping the door open to revisit more aggressive options as we gain experience.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I agree that prioritizing steady appreciation now gives us a disciplined starting point, but I also think our ability to reassess each quarter is a key asset. By starting with real estate, we maintain flexibility to pivot into higher-return assets like stocks if market signals remain favorable, allowing us to balance prudence with opportunism as we build our track record. I’m interested to hear if others see this phased approach as the best way to optimize both risk management and growth potential in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, I agree that our quarterly flexibility is a real advantage—it lets us start with a disciplined, steady asset like real estate and then pivot if conditions remain favorable. Your point about optimizing both risk management and growth potential through this phased approach resonates with me, as it allows us to build our track record responsibly while staying ready to capitalize on new opportunities. I’m interested to see if others share this view or have alternative takes on how best to sequence our risk and return.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I’d add that by keeping our process adaptable, we’re not just managing risk—we’re actively positioning ourselves to move quickly when new opportunities present themselves. This strategic flexibility could become a core advantage as we navigate future quarters, and I’d welcome any thoughts from the group on how we might best leverage this capability as market conditions evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Fiona Blaese</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong perspective on the relative risk and return of each asset in a stable market, and I believe my view can help sharpen our collective understanding, especially around the case for stocks versus real estate.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I see stocks as offering the highest potential upside in a stable market like this, with volatility contained enough that the risk feels manageable—especially since we can reassess every quarter. Real estate is a solid, steady play and I respect the logic of building a foundation there, but I’m drawn to the momentum and flexibility stocks provide, letting us set a confident, growth-oriented tone from the outset. While bonds and cash have their place for safety, I think we’d be missing an opportunity if we didn’t at least seriously consider equities when the environment is this favorable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I appreciate your focus on the growth potential of stocks and your point about volatility being contained enough in this environment to make the risk manageable. Your argument for setting a confident, growth-oriented tone from the outset is compelling, especially given our quarterly flexibility. This perspective helps us weigh whether capturing early momentum with equities might better serve our objectives than defaulting to a steadier asset, and I encourage the group to consider if this level of assertiveness matches our collective appetite for risk and return in this first quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly engages my argument for stocks and invites further consideration of whether early momentum with equities aligns with our collective appetite for risk. I can add value by highlighting how our quarterly flexibility reduces the downside of a bolder move, and by synthesizing the group’s emphasis on adaptability with my own growth-oriented stance.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think our ability to pivot each quarter really tips the scales toward being more assertive now—if stocks underperform, we can quickly shift gears without lasting damage. That flexibility means we’re not locked into a risky position, so starting strong with equities feels like a calculated move rather than a gamble. If we want to set a precedent for both ambition and adaptability, this is the moment to do it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, your point about using our ability to pivot each quarter to justify a more assertive start with stocks is well taken—it reframes the risk as manageable rather than reckless. I agree that this flexibility allows us to pursue early momentum without locking ourselves in, and your perspective is a valuable challenge to the more cautious approach. Let’s hear how others feel about setting a precedent for ambition and adaptability versus prioritizing a steadier foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response recognizes the value in my argument and opens the door for deeper synthesis between ambition and prudence. I can help clarify how our approach to risk management can coexist with a bold strategy, potentially bridging the gap between differing viewpoints in the group.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think it’s important to recognize that ambition and caution aren’t mutually exclusive here. By leveraging our ability to reassess each quarter, we’re essentially building a safety net into any assertive move we make—so we can pursue higher returns with stocks now, knowing we have the discipline to pivot if needed. This mindset could let us capture the best of both worlds as we set the tone for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I like the way you’ve framed ambition and caution as complementary, not oppositional—our quarterly review process does act as a built-in safety net, which could justify taking a bolder step without abandoning discipline. This perspective is helpful as we weigh whether our flexibility should tip the scales toward pursuing higher returns with stocks now, or if establishing a steady foundation with real estate still makes more sense for our first move. Let’s see if others feel this approach best captures the balance we want for our company’s opening strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s latest response acknowledges the value in synthesizing ambition and caution, and I see an opportunity to further clarify how our quarterly flexibility can actively support a confident, growth-oriented strategy while still respecting the group’s desire for discipline. By connecting these themes, I can help the team see that choosing stocks doesn’t mean abandoning prudence—it means using our process to manage risk as we pursue higher returns.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think the real takeaway is that our quarterly review process isn’t just a safety net—it’s a tool that lets us act boldly without being reckless. If we approach stocks with clear eyes and a willingness to pivot, we’re not just chasing returns; we’re practicing disciplined opportunism. This could set a powerful precedent for how we handle risk and reward as a team moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I appreciate your insight that our quarterly review isn’t just about protecting against downside—it’s a mechanism that empowers us to pursue opportunity with discipline. Framing it as a tool for bold but thoughtful action helps clarify how our process can define our approach to risk and reward, setting a precedent for how we operate as a team. This is an important consideration as we synthesize our options and decide what kind of decision-making culture we want to establish from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Erin Fitzpatrick</h4></p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I see real estate as offering a strong balance between steady appreciation and manageable risk, which feels well-matched to our need for both growth and a reliable foundation as we launch. Stocks are certainly tempting for higher returns in this stable environment, and I appreciate the points about our quarterly flexibility acting as a safety net, but I’m inclined to start with real estate to establish momentum without overcommitting to volatility right out of the gate.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I appreciate your focus on real estate’s ability to give us both growth and a reliable foundation as we get started. Your point about using quarterly flexibility as a safety net is spot on—it allows us to pursue steady momentum now while keeping the door open for more aggressive moves if the environment stays favorable. This approach aligns with my thinking that we can be bold without overcommitting, and it’s helpful to have this balance articulated as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think it’s important we recognize that starting with real estate doesn’t close the door to more aggressive moves—it actually positions us to act confidently if the environment continues to support higher risk. By establishing a solid base now, we’re not just playing it safe; we’re setting ourselves up to pivot quickly and responsibly into stocks if future quarters warrant it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I agree that starting with real estate gives us a solid base without shutting the door on more aggressive strategies down the line. Your point about positioning ourselves to pivot quickly if conditions support higher risk is key—it means we’re not sacrificing opportunity, just sequencing our moves to build confidence and adaptability. This balanced approach feels well-matched to both our current environment and our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I agree, and I’d add that this disciplined sequencing not only manages risk but also keeps us aligned as a team—allowing us to build trust in our process before we take on greater volatility. As we move forward, I think maintaining this balance between caution and readiness will be key to capturing opportunities without compromising our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued that stocks present the highest potential upside in the current stable market, with manageable volatility and the advantage of quarterly reassessment allowing for flexibility. The CEO acknowledged my points, appreciating the framing of stocks as a confident, growth-oriented choice balanced by the ability to pivot if needed. We agreed that the quarterly review process acts as a built-in safety net, enabling disciplined opportunism rather than reckless risk-taking. While the CEO initially favored real estate for its steadiness, he welcomed my perspective as a valuable challenge that broadened the discussion on balancing ambition with prudence. Our exchange reflected a constructive dialogue exploring how to integrate bold growth strategies with risk management in the company’s inaugural investment decision.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Joel Bird, Raja Moody, and Erin Fitzpatrick primarily supported real estate, emphasizing its balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk as a solid foundation for the company’s first investment. They highlighted the advantage of a phased, disciplined approach that leverages quarterly flexibility to pivot toward higher-return assets like stocks if conditions remain favorable. Frances Wheeler advocated for stocks, underscoring their higher return potential and manageable risk in the stable market, and stressed the quarterly review process as a safety net enabling bold but calculated moves. Across shareholders, there was consensus that cash and bonds are too conservative for current growth goals, but disagreement centered on whether to prioritize real estate’s stability or stocks’ early assertive growth, reflecting differing views on balancing ambition with prudence.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Zane Pacheco clearly favors real estate for the first quarter, citing its balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk as ideal for establishing a solid, stable foundation. He emphasizes a disciplined, phased approach that prioritizes building a track record before taking on higher volatility. While initially cautious about stocks, he remains open to the argument for assertive growth, especially given the quarterly flexibility to pivot if needed. Throughout the discussion, he actively synthesizes shareholder input, acknowledging the merits of both stability and ambition, and frames the quarterly review process as a key safety net. His position shows thoughtful pragmatism, maintaining consistency but growing more receptive to balancing boldness with prudence.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 13%<br>
- Real Estate: 45%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments came from the CEO, Joel, Raja, and Erin, who all stressed the value of establishing a solid foundation with real estate—highlighting its steady appreciation, moderate risk, and the strategic advantage of sequencing risk as we build our track record. The CEO’s synthesis of ambition and prudence, along with Erin’s point about disciplined sequencing to build team trust, nudged me to appreciate the foundational benefits of real estate even more. At the same time, Frances’s and my own arguments about stocks’ upside potential and our quarterly flexibility as a safety net kept me confident that equities remain a strong, viable option in this environment.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion made me more aware of the group’s appetite for a disciplined, phased approach—using real estate as a launchpad before taking on greater volatility. I recognize that while my instinct is to lead with ambition, the logic of building early credibility and momentum through a moderate-risk asset is compelling. I’ve also grown more attuned to how our quarterly flexibility genuinely empowers us to pursue bold moves later, rather than needing to seize every opportunity immediately. My thinking has evolved to value the balance between setting a confident tone and establishing a reliable foundation for the company’s investment culture.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: After weighing the arguments, I now see real estate as the best fit for our first quarter. It offers a prudent balance of growth and risk, aligns with the group’s consensus, and sets us up to pivot confidently into higher-return assets like stocks if conditions remain favorable. Our quarterly review process means we’re not sacrificing ambition—just sequencing it for maximum impact. This approach lets us build credibility, momentum, and adaptability from the outset.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we’ve made significant progress in clarifying the risk-return profiles of each asset and have begun to surface the core tension between foundational stability and assertive growth, I see unresolved questions around how our quarterly flexibility truly impacts our collective risk appetite and the specific uncertainties or opportunities unique to each option. Continuing the discussion will allow us to address any lingering doubts, invite further scenario analysis, and ensure all voices are fully considered before we move to a formal proposal. This approach aligns with my pragmatic, hands-on leadership style—prioritizing a thorough, open process to maximize the quality of our decision and build stronger consensus within the group.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Zane Pacheco has set the theme: &#x27;Identifying and addressing key uncertainties, concerns, and opportunities for each asset choice | Expected outcome: Surface and evaluate specific risks, doubts, or unique advantages associated with each option to inform a more nuanced assessment&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Zane Pacheco My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because while I&#x27;m still most confident in real estate as the optimal balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk for our inaugural quarter, the strong case for stocks has shifted my perspective. Our quarterly flexibility does make a more assertive play less risky than I first assessed, and I see real value in setting a tone of adaptability and ambition. However, I believe starting with a solid foundation in real estate best positions us to pivot into higher-return assets later, maintaining both prudence and readiness for opportunity, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, I’d like us to focus on surfacing and evaluating the specific uncertainties, concerns, and unique opportunities tied to each asset, so we can move beyond theory and address any practical risks or overlooked advantages. By openly sharing doubts and insights, we can collectively sharpen our risk assessment and strengthen our decision-making process. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to contribute any perspectives or concerns—especially those I may not have fully considered—to help us reach the most robust, well-informed decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Erin Fitzpatrick</h4></p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I see real estate’s main uncertainty as the potential for short-term illiquidity or unexpected market flatness, which could limit our ability to quickly pivot if better opportunities arise in later quarters. On the other hand, stocks offer clear upside in a stable market, but their volatility—even if muted—introduces more risk of a poor start that could shake confidence early. Our quarterly review process does give us a safety net, but I think we need to weigh whether setting a steady foundation with real estate is worth the trade-off in immediate growth potential from stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I appreciate you surfacing the trade-off between real estate’s potential illiquidity and the risk of stocks underperforming early. Your point about how a slow start could impact team confidence—even with quarterly flexibility in place—is especially relevant. I think it’s important we dig deeper into whether the foundational stability of real estate outweighs the opportunity cost of missing immediate upside from stocks, and whether our process truly mitigates those risks as much as we think.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I agree that we need to examine whether the confidence and stability from starting with real estate truly outweigh the possibility of missing early gains in stocks, especially since our quarterly process allows us to pivot if needed. I’d also like to consider if the psychological impact of a poor first quarter in stocks could make us more risk-averse later, potentially limiting our willingness to act boldly when the timing is right. This balance between initial stability and future adaptability seems central to choosing the best path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I think you’ve zeroed in on a critical dynamic: the way our first-quarter outcome could influence our collective appetite for risk down the line. I agree that it’s not just about the numbers—if we stumble early, it might make us second-guess bold moves later, even when the data supports them. Let’s make sure we weigh not only the direct financial risks, but also the potential impact on our team’s willingness to stay agile and decisive as the year unfolds.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I think if we start with real estate and see steady progress, it could foster a sense of trust in our process and encourage us to take calculated risks when opportunities arise. Conversely, if we lead with stocks and experience volatility, it might make us overly cautious—even if the data later supports bolder moves. Balancing this psychological dimension with the practical risk-return trade-off should be a key part of our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Erin—establishing early trust in our process is just as important as the raw numbers, especially as it can set the tone for how boldly we act when new opportunities come up. If we’re disciplined now and build confidence with steady progress, we’ll be better positioned to seize bigger opportunities later without hesitation. Let’s keep this balance in mind as we evaluate the remaining options and hear from the rest of the team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Raja Moody</h4></p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I agree that our ability to reassess each quarter reduces the long-term downside of a single decision, but I’m still cautious about the short-term illiquidity risk with real estate—if we need to pivot quickly, we might not have that option. For stocks, while the quarterly review helps manage risk, even moderate volatility could undermine early momentum and team confidence, as Erin mentioned. I’d like us to weigh whether the steady, predictable returns from real estate are worth the potential opportunity cost, or if the disciplined structure we’ve built is robust enough to handle a bolder, more volatile start with stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, you’re raising an important point about the limits of our flexibility if we go with real estate—there’s a real risk that we could miss out on pivoting quickly if the market shifts. At the same time, your question about whether our structure can actually support a bolder, more volatile start with stocks is spot on. I think we need to challenge ourselves to honestly assess whether the stability of real estate is worth the potential opportunity cost, or if our process and team dynamic are resilient enough to handle early volatility without losing our nerve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate you framing the question so directly. From my perspective, the key is whether our team has enough shared discipline and trust in our process to avoid overreacting to either steady but unspectacular returns from real estate or the inevitable swings in stocks. If we can be honest about our risk tolerance and stick to our agreed framework, I’m more confident we can adapt successfully—regardless of which path we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Raja—the real test here is whether we can maintain discipline and avoid overreacting, whether we’re facing slow, steady returns from real estate or riding out swings in stocks. Our framework is only as strong as our collective commitment to it, so being honest about our risk tolerance now will help us stick to our strategy and stay agile, no matter what the first quarter brings. Let’s keep pushing for clarity on where our true comfort zone lies so we make a choice we can all stand behind.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I think it’s worth explicitly acknowledging that our comfort with risk isn’t just theoretical—it will show up in how we react to real results, especially if we’re tested early. If we’re clear-eyed now about what level of uncertainty we can truly handle, we’ll be better able to commit to our chosen path, whether that means accepting lower but predictable gains from real estate or being prepared for the ups and downs with stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I completely agree, Raja—how we actually respond when faced with real results will reveal our true risk tolerance far more than any theoretical discussion. By being upfront now about what level of uncertainty we’re genuinely comfortable with, we can make a decision that we’ll stand by, whether that means accepting steady returns or riding out some volatility. This honesty is what will keep us aligned and resilient, whichever path we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Frances Wheeler</h4></p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I think the main uncertainty with stocks is whether even in a stable market, we’re underestimating the impact that short-term volatility could have on our confidence and willingness to stick with our process if things don’t go our way right out of the gate. On the flip side, real estate’s biggest risk is probably liquidity—if the market shifts or we spot a stronger opportunity, we might find ourselves locked in or slow to react, which doesn’t fit my preference for adaptability. I’m still leaning toward stocks because our quarterly review gives us a built-in safety net, but I see more value now in the argument for establishing a steady foundation if the group’s risk tolerance isn’t fully aligned with mine.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate how you’re weighing both the psychological and practical risks—short-term volatility with stocks and liquidity with real estate—and your openness to recalibrating if the group’s risk appetite differs from your own. The way you frame the quarterly review as a safety net is helpful, but your point about adaptability versus foundational stability really sharpens our focus. Let’s keep surfacing where our true comfort zones lie so we can make a decision that everyone can commit to, even if it means rethinking our personal leanings.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree that surfacing our true comfort zones now is crucial, and I appreciate how this discussion is making us more honest about what we can actually commit to as a team. I’d add that our quarterly review isn’t just a safety net—it’s a tool that can help us build trust in our process, whether we start with stocks or real estate, by giving us regular checkpoints to recalibrate if needed. That flexibility is what gives me confidence we can handle either path as long as we’re upfront about our risk tolerance from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I agree that our quarterly review process is more than just a backstop—it’s a proactive tool for building trust and keeping us adaptable as a team. Your emphasis on using these checkpoints to recalibrate and stay honest about our risk tolerance will be critical, whichever path we choose. Let’s continue to make that transparency central to our decision so we’re all genuinely committed to the course we set.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think if we all commit to open, direct check-ins each quarter, it’ll help us stay aligned and responsive—whether we’re facing steady returns or unexpected swings. That kind of discipline will let us take calculated risks without losing sight of our shared goals, and it’s what gives me confidence that either choice can work if we’re honest about what we need as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Joel Bird</h4></p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I think the biggest uncertainty with real estate is short-term illiquidity—if the market shifts or a better opportunity appears, we might not be able to move fast enough. But in a stable environment like this, that risk is pretty manageable, and the steady appreciation gives us a reliable launchpad. My take is that starting with real estate lets us build trust in our process and keeps us agile for bolder moves later, especially if we’re disciplined about reassessing each quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I appreciate how you’re contextualizing the illiquidity risk within our actual market environment—it’s a real concern, but I agree that in these stable conditions, it’s less likely to materially limit us. Your point about using real estate as a launchpad for trust and future agility is well taken, especially if we stay disciplined in our quarterly reviews. Let’s continue to weigh whether the reliability of real estate’s returns gives us enough flexibility to pivot boldly when new opportunities arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I agree that the reliability of real estate’s returns, combined with our structured quarterly reviews, gives us a strong foundation without boxing us in. If we’re clear about our process and honest in our assessments, we can use this first step to build both credibility and readiness—so when the time is right, we’ll have the confidence and cohesion to act boldly on higher-return options like stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I think you’ve captured the essence of what makes real estate compelling for our first move—steady returns and credibility, paired with the discipline of quarterly reviews that keep us from getting locked in or complacent. If we’re honest about our process and stick to it, we can use this foundation to stay nimble and ready to seize bigger opportunities when they arise. This approach balances both the need for trust and the ambition to pivot decisively as conditions evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Fiona Blaese</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I see real value in highlighting how our quarterly flexibility interacts with the unique risks and advantages of both real estate and stocks, especially given my own shift in perspective and the team’s evolving comfort with risk.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think our quarterly flexibility is a real game-changer—it means that even if we start with real estate for its steady returns and credibility, we’re not locked into a conservative path. If market signals shift or stocks become even more attractive, we can pivot quickly. That said, I do see the risk that real estate’s illiquidity could limit our agility if we spot a sudden opportunity, but in this stable market, I’m comfortable that the trade-off is worth it to establish trust and discipline from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I think you’re right to highlight how our quarterly flexibility fundamentally changes the risk equation—even with real estate’s illiquidity, we aren’t locked into a single path if we stay disciplined in reassessing each quarter. Your point about accepting this trade-off to build trust and discipline is well taken, especially since it positions us to act confidently when new opportunities arise. Let’s keep this focus on balancing credibility and adaptability at the center of our decision as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response builds on my point about quarterly flexibility, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize how this discipline not only manages risk but also sets us up for bolder moves later. Emphasizing how trust and adaptability reinforce each other could help the group align more fully around a strategy that balances both ambition and prudence.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I agree—by prioritizing discipline in our quarterly reviews, we’re not just managing risk, we’re actively building the trust and cohesion needed to seize bigger opportunities when they come. That foundation gives us the confidence to be ambitious later, knowing we have a process that keeps us both grounded and agile. I think this approach sets the right tone for our company’s culture and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I completely agree—establishing discipline in our quarterly reviews isn’t just about risk management; it’s the foundation for building the kind of trust and team cohesion that lets us seize bigger opportunities when the timing is right. By setting this tone now, we’re positioning ourselves to act with both confidence and agility as conditions evolve, which is exactly the culture we want for our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the importance of discipline and trust, but I see value in explicitly connecting this foundation to our future investment decisions—especially as it relates to how we evaluate when to pivot from real estate to stocks. Articulating this link could help clarify for the group how our initial choice sets us up for ongoing adaptability and boldness.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I’d add that by embedding this discipline from the start, we’re also creating a clear framework for evaluating when it’s time to pivot into higher-return assets like stocks. This means our initial move into real estate isn’t just about caution—it’s about setting up a system where we can confidently recognize and act on new opportunities as soon as they make sense, without second-guessing ourselves or losing momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I think you’ve articulated a key advantage—by embedding discipline from the outset, we’re not just protecting against downside, we’re actively building a system that empowers us to act decisively when new opportunities arise. Framing our real estate investment as the start of a dynamic, opportunity-ready process—not just a safe choice—really sharpens the strategic value of this approach. This mindset ensures we’re always prepared to pivot boldly, rather than getting stuck in a passive or reactive mode.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has fully captured and reinforced my key point about discipline serving as a launchpad for dynamic, opportunity-ready decision-making. Further response would risk redundancy rather than adding new value.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 2, I emphasized that our quarterly flexibility transforms the risk landscape by allowing us to pivot quickly even if we start with real estate, which offers steady returns and builds trust and discipline. The CEO agreed, acknowledging that this discipline not only manages risk but also creates a foundation for seizing future opportunities with confidence and agility. We concurred that embedding this disciplined review process early establishes a dynamic framework empowering decisive action when new opportunities arise, framing real estate as a strategic launchpad rather than merely a conservative choice. The CEO appreciated my articulation of how this approach balances credibility and adaptability, reinforcing the cultural tone we want for long-term success. Our exchange reflected mutual recognition that disciplined process and flexibility together enable a prudent yet ambitious investment strategy.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 2, Joel Bird, Erin Fitzpatrick, and Raja Moody consistently supported real estate, emphasizing its steady appreciation and moderate risk as a reliable foundation for the company’s first investment. They highlighted concerns about real estate&#x27;s short-term illiquidity but viewed it as manageable in the current stable market, stressing that disciplined quarterly reviews would maintain adaptability and trust. Frances Wheeler remained the primary advocate for stocks, underscoring their higher return potential but cautioning about short-term volatility’s possible impact on early momentum and team confidence. Across shareholders, there was agreement that cash and bonds are too conservative, while the main disagreement centered on balancing the psychological and practical risks of stocks’ volatility versus real estate’s illiquidity, reflecting differing comfort levels with risk and adaptability.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Zane Pacheco favors real estate as the optimal first-quarter investment, citing its balance of steady appreciation and moderate risk as ideal for establishing a solid, stable foundation. He emphasizes a disciplined, phased approach that prioritizes building a track record before taking on higher volatility, while acknowledging that quarterly flexibility reduces the risk of a more assertive play with stocks. His position reflects thoughtful pragmatism, integrating shareholder input by recognizing both the value of stability and the appeal of adaptability and ambition. Over the discussion, his stance evolved to more openly appreciate the merits of assertive growth, especially given the safety net provided by regular quarterly reviews, but he maintains that starting with real estate best positions the company for prudent yet opportunistic future moves.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 1%<br>
- Bonds: 8%<br>
- Real Estate: 56%<br>
- Stocks: 35%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments were the CEO’s and team’s emphasis on how disciplined quarterly reviews build trust and adaptability, not just risk management. Erin and Raja’s points about the psychological impact of our first quarter—how a shaky start with stocks could make us overly cautious later—made me appreciate the value of establishing a stable foundation. Joel’s framing of real estate as a launchpad for credibility and future agility resonated, especially given the manageable illiquidity risk in a stable market. Frances’s continued advocacy for stocks kept me mindful of the upside, but the consensus around building trust and team discipline with real estate tipped the balance for me.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round helped me see that my own appetite for bold moves can be more effective when it’s grounded in a foundation of team trust and process discipline. I’ve become more aware of how our initial decision isn’t just about immediate returns, but about shaping our culture and risk tolerance for the long haul. The discussion clarified that our quarterly flexibility truly empowers us to be opportunistic later, so starting with real estate isn’t a retreat from ambition—it’s a strategic sequence. I’m now more confident that this approach aligns both with my instincts for action and the team’s need for cohesion.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate offers the best balance of steady growth and moderate risk, and—crucially—lets us build the trust and discipline needed for bolder moves later. The quarterly review process gives us genuine flexibility to pivot if conditions change, so we’re not sacrificing ambition, just sequencing it smartly. Starting here sets the right tone for our investment culture and keeps us both credible and agile. Given the group’s consensus and the compelling logic around risk psychology, real estate is clearly the strongest play for our first quarter.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We have thoroughly explored the practical risks, psychological factors, and strategic implications of each option from multiple angles. The group has surfaced all key uncertainties, addressed both the financial and cultural impacts of our first move, and reached a clear understanding of how our quarterly review process supports adaptability regardless of our choice. At this point, further discussion would yield diminishing returns. I am confident we have the insight and consensus needed to move forward with a well-supported proposal for our Q1 investment.</p><p><br>

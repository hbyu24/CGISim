<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I decisively advocated for Option C, favoring the full deployment of 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was grounded in the stable market environment that encourages maximizing capital utilization without over-concentration in any quarter, balancing growth potential with risk management. The CEO, Zane Pacheco, responded positively to my input, affirming the practicality and balanced nature of Option C and emphasizing agility and flexibility, which aligned closely with my reasoning. Other shareholders echoed my stance, reinforcing the rationale for Option C. The voting concluded unanimously in favor of Option C (6/6 votes), confirming our collective agreement. My preferred option was fully adopted, reinforcing my confidence in the decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Zane Pacheco demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with a clear, contextual overview of market conditions and available options. His articulation of Option C as a bold yet calculated strategy showed sound judgment, and he effectively facilitated open discussion by inviting diverse perspectives and emphasizing factual evaluation within the set options. He excelled at synthesizing shareholder input, notably echoing my points on agility and risk diversification, which helped build consensus. However, while the CEO maintained a consistent position, there was limited challenge to assumptions or exploration of contrarian views during the discussion, which could be an area for improvement to strengthen scenario analysis. The decision-making process functioned efficiently, with thorough examination of risks and benefits, leading to a unanimous, well-supported final decision. I believe the adoption of Option C is optimal for the company’s first year, balancing growth ambitions with prudent risk management and flexibility.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the value of clear, concise articulation of well-reasoned positions aligned with market realities, which facilitated consensus-building. I learned that in stable environments, shareholders and leadership tend to favor decisive, full-capital deployment strategies that preserve flexibility rather than overly cautious approaches. Moving forward, I will continue to assert my perspectives confidently but remain attentive to emerging alternative views to ensure robustness in our decisions. I observed a pattern where practical, action-oriented arguments gain traction more readily than speculative or overly cautious ones in this group dynamic. Key takeaways include the importance of grounding arguments in current data and market conditions, advocating for balanced yet bold strategies, and recognizing when to step back to listen to others to refine understanding—elements that will guide my future participation and influence.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I initially advocated for investing in stocks, emphasizing their higher return potential in the current stable market and the mitigating effect of our quarterly reassessment flexibility. I positioned stocks as a bold yet calculated choice to set a confident, growth-oriented tone for the company’s inaugural investment. CEO Zane Pacheco responded thoughtfully to my input, valuing the growth ambition I presented while still favoring real estate for its steadiness. Throughout the discussions, I engaged actively to highlight how quarterly flexibility transforms risk management, enabling us to balance ambition with discipline. Over the course of the two rounds, my confidence shifted toward real estate as I recognized the value of building foundational trust and discipline before pursuing higher volatility. The CEO’s proposal for real estate was unanimously supported by all shareholders, including myself, resulting in a 6/6 vote approval. Although my preferred initial option—stocks—was not adopted, I aligned with the final decision after thorough consideration and dialogue, appreciating how real estate strategically positions us to pivot opportunistically in future quarters.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Zane Pacheco excelled in structuring the meeting around clear themes that progressively deepened our collective understanding—from theoretical risk-return profiles to practical uncertainties and psychological factors. His balanced facilitation encouraged open dialogue while maintaining focus on predefined options. Notably, the CEO demonstrated strong synthesis skills by integrating diverse shareholder perspectives, including my own, to frame the quarterly review process as a dynamic safety net supporting both caution and ambition. Where improvement is possible, the CEO could have fostered more contrarian challenge earlier to test assumptions rigorously, as he himself acknowledged in his closing remarks. The decision-making process was highly effective: it was thorough, transparent, and iterative, allowing shifts in shareholder positions based on evolving insights. The unanimous approval of real estate reflects a well-considered consensus aligned with both financial prudence and cultural foundation-building. I believe this final decision is sound for the company’s first quarter as it balances steady growth with strategic flexibility, laying the groundwork for future bold moves.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced that successful decision-making in our group hinges on articulating clear, data-grounded reasoning while remaining open to evolving group dynamics and insights. I learned that while my instinct favors early assertive growth, aligning with the team’s appetite for discipline and trust-building can strengthen consensus and long-term momentum. The discussions highlighted that quarterly flexibility is not merely a risk mitigation tool but a strategic enabler for disciplined opportunism—an insight I will emphasize more explicitly in future meetings. I intend to continue advocating confidently for bold strategies but will integrate a stronger focus on process discipline and psychological factors influencing group risk tolerance. A key pattern emerged: practical, balanced arguments that connect ambition with prudence resonate best in our collective dynamic. Going forward, I will leverage this understanding to better anticipate how my proposals might be received and to frame them in ways that bridge differing perspectives. Overall, this experience deepened my appreciation of the interplay between financial strategy and cultural foundation-setting, which will guide my future contributions to ensure our company’s sustained growth and adaptability.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my firm advocacy for investing in stocks this quarter, emphasizing the strong 20% return from stocks last quarter combined with the stable market environment and our robust quarterly review process. I positioned stocks as the optimal choice to leverage upside potential while managing risk through our agility and adaptability. CEO Zane Pacheco responded very positively to my input, echoing the importance of disciplined risk-taking and transparent review protocols to build team confidence and resilience, fully integrating my perspective into his rationale. Other shareholders were split, with Raja Moody and Frances Wheeler supporting stocks, while Joel Bird and Erin Fitzpatrick favored continuing with real estate for stability and sequencing risk. Despite this, the CEO’s leadership and the compelling synthesis of arguments in favor of stocks swayed the group to unanimous approval. The final vote was 6/6 in favor of investing in stocks, fully adopting my preferred option and reinforcing my confidence in the decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Zane Pacheco demonstrated effective leadership by structuring the meeting with clear themes—first establishing a shared baseline on asset performance and risk appetite, then systematically addressing risk assessment and scenario analysis. His ability to facilitate open, candid discussion while keeping focus on predefined options ensured that all shareholders contributed meaningfully. Zane excelled at synthesizing diverse perspectives, particularly integrating my emphasis on disciplined risk-taking and the psychological dimensions of handling setbacks. His openness to exploring concerns around team confidence and review protocols fostered a mature dialogue that balanced ambition with prudence. An area for improvement might be encouraging even earlier contrarian challenges to assumptions, as noted in prior reflections, to deepen scenario analysis further. The company’s decision-making process worked efficiently and transparently, culminating in a unanimous vote grounded in robust discussion. I believe the final decision to invest in stocks is well-suited to the company’s current position: it leverages our strong foundation and process discipline to pursue higher returns while maintaining adaptability and team cohesion.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of aligning financial strategy with cultural and psychological factors in group decision-making. I learned that articulating how disciplined, transparent review protocols not only manage financial risk but also build team resilience is key to gaining consensus when advocating bold moves. I also recognized the importance of proactively addressing potential setbacks through structured communication and sentiment tracking to maintain trust and adaptability. In future meetings, I will continue to assert my preference for opportunistic investments when conditions are favorable but will place even greater emphasis on connecting those choices to our process discipline and team dynamics. A pattern emerged where practical, data-supported arguments combined with explicit acknowledgment of psychological impacts resonate strongly with the group. Key takeaways include the value of framing risk-taking as a team-building exercise, the necessity of dynamic, meaningful review processes, and the advantage of balancing ambition with a fallback plan to maintain cohesion. These insights will guide my future participation to ensure that I contribute not only strategically but also constructively to our culture of disciplined adaptability.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $24984.38 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Stocks, Return: -10.0% ($-2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Zane Pacheco notes that stocks have shown the highest upside potential but also the greatest volatility, with a strong 20% gain followed by a -10% loss, underscoring their risk-reward profile even in stable conditions. Real estate has delivered steady growth in one quarter and flat performance in another, highlighting its reliability but also its limits in terms of upside. Cash and bonds have provided consistent, low returns, making them safe but not particularly attractive for aggressive growth in a stable market—so our challenge is to balance bold moves with disciplined risk management as we decide our next step.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Fiona Blaese CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 45%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: I’m drawn to stocks this quarter because, even after last quarter’s dip, the overall environment is still stable and our process lets us quickly adapt if things don’t go our way. I like the idea of capitalizing on upside potential while we have the flexibility to pivot, and I’m not afraid to take calculated risks when the odds are reasonable. Real estate is tempting for its steady returns, but I don’t want to get stuck playing it too safe when we could be building momentum. Bonds and cash just feel too conservative for where we are right now—I’d rather keep pushing for growth as long as the risk is manageable.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Zane Pacheco has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual baseline of what worked and what didn’t in prior quarters, surfacing any patterns or surprises in asset performance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Zane Pacheco My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because I see stocks as offering the highest upside this quarter, even after last quarter’s loss—volatility is part of the game, and our disciplined process lets us adapt quickly if things turn. Real estate is still reliable, but its upside feels capped right now, and I’m not interested in playing it too safe when the market is stable and we have room to recover. Bonds and cash are just too conservative for where we are as a company; I’d rather take a calculated risk and keep us moving forward. My instinct is to stay agile and bold, but I’m ready to adjust if the team surfaces a compelling reason to play it safer, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, let’s focus on reviewing our historical performance and surfacing any lessons learned—what’s worked, what hasn’t, and any patterns or surprises that have emerged in how each asset performed. By establishing a factual baseline, we can challenge assumptions and ensure our next move is grounded in what the data actually tells us, not just our gut instincts.</p><p>I encourage everyone to share their observations and interpretations—especially if you see something I might have missed or have a different take on how past results should inform our decision now. Let’s use this round to synthesize our experiences and build a shared understanding of the landscape before we move on to deeper risk-reward analysis.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Frances Wheeler</h4></p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;Looking at our results so far, stocks have delivered both the highest gain and the biggest loss—even in a stable market, the swings are real. Real estate gave us a solid start but then stalled, which reinforces that its returns are steady but not always guaranteed quarter to quarter. Cash and bonds have been predictable but underwhelming for growth. For me, the lesson is that our quarterly review process gives us the flexibility to take calculated risks with stocks or lean on real estate’s reliability, but we shouldn’t expect past performance to repeat automatically—adaptability is key.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Frances, I appreciate your clear breakdown of how both stocks and real estate have behaved—your point about adaptability really resonates with me. The swings in stocks and the occasional flatness in real estate reinforce that our quarterly review process is a real asset, letting us pivot as needed instead of locking us into any one path. I agree that we can’t rely on past performance to repeat, so keeping our approach flexible and grounded in current data is crucial as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree—our ability to pivot each quarter is what turns volatility from something to fear into something we can actually use to our advantage. If we treat every outcome as a learning opportunity and stay disciplined in our reviews, we’ll keep getting sharper at spotting when to lean into risk and when to pull back, regardless of what the last quarter looked like.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I completely agree—treating every outcome as a learning opportunity is what will keep us sharp and resilient. Our disciplined review process is what gives us the freedom to be bold when it makes sense and to dial back when the signals change. That mindset of continuous learning and adaptability is exactly what will help us make the most of both the upside and the inevitable bumps along the way.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I think that mindset is exactly what gives us an edge—being willing to take a swing with stocks when the upside is there, but also knowing we can shift gears if the data points us in a new direction. Real estate’s reliability is always in our back pocket, but our process lets us pursue bigger gains without getting reckless. That balance is what makes me comfortable leaning toward stocks again this quarter, as long as we keep our reviews sharp and honest.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Erin Fitzpatrick</h4></p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I’m noticing that while stocks offered the highest upside in Q1, the sharp drop in Q2 reinforces how unpredictable even a stable market can be. Real estate, on the other hand, gave us a strong start and then a flat quarter—so while it’s not immune to slow periods, its downside has been limited so far. For me, the main lesson is that steady, disciplined progress has served us well, and I’d like us to keep that in mind as we weigh whether to re-engage with higher volatility or lean on what’s worked for stability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, your point about the unpredictability of stocks—even in a stable market—really drives home that there’s no such thing as a sure thing, even with the assets that look most promising on paper. I agree that steady, disciplined progress has served us well, and I think the real question is whether we’re ready to trade some of that reliability for the chance at bigger gains, or if it’s smarter to play to our strengths for another quarter. Your focus on what’s actually worked is exactly the kind of grounding we need as we move into deeper risk-reward analysis.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I appreciate you highlighting the tradeoff so directly. I think it’s worth considering that our ability to recover from volatility is stronger now that we’ve built a solid foundation, but I’m still inclined to favor options that preserve steady progress—especially since even a flat quarter in real estate hasn’t set us back. Maybe the key is weighing how much risk we’re truly willing to accept at this stage, given what we’ve learned about both asset classes so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, I think you’re absolutely right that our ability to recover from volatility is stronger now, thanks to the foundation we’ve built. Your focus on weighing how much risk we’re truly willing to accept—given our track record so far—gets to the heart of our decision this quarter. As we move forward, I’d like us to be explicit about where our collective risk appetite stands, so we can make a choice that’s both bold and grounded in what we’ve learned.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I think being explicit about our current risk appetite is crucial, especially since we now have firsthand experience with both the upside and downside of our choices. For me, that means I’m comfortable with moderate risk—real estate still feels like the right balance, but I’m open to hearing arguments for stocks if the group’s appetite for risk has genuinely shifted based on what we’ve learned.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Joel Bird: &quot;Looking at the numbers, stocks have given us both the biggest win and the hardest hit, even though the market’s stable. Real estate hasn’t dazzled, but it’s kept us from losing ground when things turned, which matters for momentum. The lesson for me is that while chasing upside is tempting, having a reliable anchor like real estate in our mix has protected us from bigger setbacks, and that’s worth factoring in as we decide how bold to be this round.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I think your point about real estate acting as a stabilizing anchor is well taken—it’s easy to focus on chasing the upside, but not losing ground when things turn is just as important for building sustainable momentum. The fact that real estate has protected us from bigger setbacks is a pattern we shouldn’t overlook, especially as we calibrate how bold we want to be this quarter. Factoring in that kind of reliability alongside the temptation for bigger gains will help us strike the right balance as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I appreciate that, and I’d add that the real value isn’t just in picking one style over the other, but in knowing when to lean on stability and when to press for upside. Our track record suggests that using real estate as a reset button after volatility lets us stay in the game without getting spooked by losses, so maybe the real takeaway is about timing our bold moves rather than always chasing or always playing it safe.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I think you’re onto something important with the idea that it’s not just about which asset we pick, but when we choose to lean into risk versus reset with stability. Our experience so far does suggest that having real estate as a fallback after a volatile quarter helps us keep our composure and momentum. As we move forward, being intentional about when to take calculated swings and when to regroup could be the difference between steady progress and unnecessary setbacks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I think if we’re deliberate about alternating between bold and stabilizing moves—using real estate when we need to reset and stocks when the timing feels right—we can turn volatility into a tool instead of a threat. The key is treating each quarter as a chance to reassess, not just react, so our choices stay proactive and grounded in what’s actually happening, not just habit or fear.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Joel, I really like your framing of volatility as something we can actually use to our advantage if we’re deliberate about how and when we take risks. Treating each quarter as a proactive opportunity to reassess keeps us from falling into patterns driven by fear or habit, and it’s exactly the kind of mindset that lets us stay agile without losing sight of our longer-term momentum. This approach helps ensure we’re making choices based on what’s actually happening, not just reacting to past outcomes.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I agree, and I’d suggest that if we keep using our quarterly reviews to consciously decide when to pivot between upside and stability, we’ll avoid falling into autopilot or emotional swings. That way, we’re not just managing risk—we’re actively shaping our trajectory, quarter by quarter, with our eyes wide open.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Fiona Blaese</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I see clear patterns in our results that are relevant to this theme, and I want to highlight how our process lets us turn both volatility and stability into strategic advantages.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;Looking at our history, stocks handed us the highest gain and the sharpest loss, while real estate gave us a steady start but then flatlined—so neither is a guaranteed win, even in a stable market. What stands out to me is that our quarterly review process is our real edge: it lets us stay bold and chase upside with stocks when conditions are right, but also regroup with real estate if we need to steady the ship. The lesson for me is that our adaptability—not the assets themselves—is what’s worked best so far, so I’m inclined to keep pushing for upside while we have the flexibility to pivot if needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I think you’ve nailed a key insight—the real advantage we’ve developed isn’t tied to any single asset, but to our ability to adapt and pivot when the situation calls for it. Our quarterly review process is what lets us chase opportunity with stocks or lean on real estate’s steadiness without getting locked into either approach. That adaptability is what’s kept us resilient, and it should stay at the center of how we think about this quarter’s decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the importance of adaptability, and I see an opportunity to synthesize this with others’ points about timing and risk appetite, helping clarify how our process can inform the optimal balance for this quarter.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I agree—keeping adaptability at the core means we don’t have to box ourselves into one style of investing. If we stay honest about our risk appetite and use each quarterly review as a real checkpoint, we can confidently lean into stocks for upside or pivot back to real estate for stability, depending on what the data and our team’s mindset tell us. That approach keeps us proactive instead of reactive, which is exactly how we keep our edge.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Fiona, I completely agree—anchoring our process in adaptability means we’re not tied to any one style or asset, but can make informed, confident moves based on current data and team sentiment. Treating each quarterly review as a genuine checkpoint keeps us proactive and ready to capitalize on upside or regroup for stability as needed. This mindset is exactly what will keep us sharp and ahead of the curve as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s reply strongly aligns with my thinking, but I see value in reinforcing the link between adaptability and our collective discipline, especially as it relates to building trust for bolder moves.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I appreciate that, and I think embedding this adaptability into our team culture is what gives us the confidence to take swings when the timing feels right. As long as we keep our process disciplined and transparent, we can trust ourselves to make bold moves or pull back as needed—turning both risk and stability into real advantages for the company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Raja Moody</h4></p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;Reviewing our past two quarters, I notice that while stocks offered the highest upside, they also exposed us to significant volatility—even in a stable market—whereas real estate provided steady growth initially, followed by a flat period but no real downside. The main lesson I draw is that our disciplined quarterly review process has allowed us to experiment with higher risk while preserving the option to reset with more reliable assets like real estate. This pattern suggests that maintaining flexibility and a clear-eyed approach to risk is what’s worked best so far, and I think it’s important we keep that in mind as we decide how much volatility we’re willing to accept this round.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, I think your summary captures the core of what we’ve learned—our process has given us the freedom to test higher-risk assets like stocks without locking us in, and the ability to reset with real estate when needed. Your point about keeping flexibility and a clear-eyed view on risk at the center of our decision-making is spot on. As we move forward, being honest about how much volatility we’re prepared to take on will be key to making the most of both our bold moves and our fallback options.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate your focus on staying honest about our tolerance for volatility. I’d add that our process doesn’t just allow us to pivot between assets—it also helps us avoid overreacting to short-term results, whether positive or negative. If we keep using quarterly data as an objective checkpoint, we’ll be able to make disciplined decisions that serve our long-term goals, regardless of recent swings.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Raja, I think that’s a crucial point—our process isn’t just about being able to pivot, it’s what keeps us from getting whipsawed by short-term results or letting one quarter dictate our whole approach. Using quarterly data as an objective checkpoint helps us stay disciplined and focused on the bigger picture, making sure our decisions are grounded in what’s best for our long-term goals, not just reacting to the latest outcome.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I agree—grounding our decisions in objective data rather than emotional reactions is what will keep us consistent and resilient, especially after a volatile quarter. If we treat each review as a chance to recalibrate based on facts, not feelings, we’ll be better positioned to pursue growth without losing sight of our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Fiona Blaese UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 50%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Frances’s emphasis on adaptability and disciplined quarterly reviews reinforced my conviction that our process—not any single asset—gives us the edge to pursue upside with stocks while managing risk. Joel’s point about using real estate as a reset option after volatility made me slightly more open to its value this quarter, but the group’s consensus on the importance of flexibility and learning from each outcome strengthened my preference for a bold, proactive approach. Erin’s argument for steady progress with real estate was logical, but the evidence of our ability to recover from volatility and the current stable market context keeps me leaning toward stocks.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my appreciation of how our disciplined, adaptable process empowers us to confidently pursue high-upside opportunities without overcommitting. I’m more aware of the value in timing our risk-taking and the psychological safety our review process provides. While I remain growth-oriented, I now more consciously factor in the team’s risk appetite and the strategic use of fallback options like real estate, making my stance more nuanced and resilient.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: After weighing all perspectives, I believe stocks offer the best balance of growth potential and manageable risk, especially given our robust review process and stable market conditions. Our adaptability allows us to capitalize on upside while retaining the option to reset with real estate if needed. The disciplined, transparent process we’ve built gives me confidence that we can handle volatility and turn both wins and setbacks into learning opportunities. While real estate remains a strong fallback, I see greater value in using this quarter to pursue bold gains and sharpen our team’s adaptability.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: We’ve established a solid factual baseline and surfaced valuable lessons from our historical performance, but there remains a meaningful divergence in risk appetite and views on the optimal timing for bold versus stabilizing moves. A focused risk-reward analysis and scenario planning round will allow us to explicitly weigh the specific risks, potential returns, and adaptability of each asset in the current context. This additional round will help clarify our collective risk tolerance, integrate nuanced shareholder insights, and ensure our final decision is robust, well-supported, and aligned with both our growth objectives and team resilience.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Zane Pacheco has set the theme: &#x27;Risk-reward analysis and scenario planning for each asset option | Expected outcome: Identify and evaluate the specific risks, potential returns, and adaptability of each asset given current market conditions and company objectives&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Zane Pacheco My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because after hearing the group’s perspectives, I remain inclined toward stocks for their upside, but with a stronger appreciation for the deliberate use of real estate as a stabilizer. Our disciplined review process and adaptability give me confidence that we can take calculated risks without being reckless, and the ability to pivot each quarter is a real advantage. The discussion has sharpened my awareness of risk timing and the psychological value of steady progress, but I still believe stocks offer the best balance of growth potential and process-driven risk management for this quarter, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, we’ll focus on risk-reward analysis and scenario planning for each asset option—our goal is to identify and evaluate the specific risks, potential returns, and adaptability of each choice given current market conditions and our company objectives. This is our opportunity to synthesize diverse perspectives, challenge assumptions, and develop a more complete understanding of which asset best balances growth, risk, and resilience for the team. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage you to share any insights, concerns, or scenarios that might enhance our collective understanding, especially perspectives I may not have fully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Joel Bird</h4></p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I’m weighing the risk-reward tradeoff through the lens of our quarterly adaptability. Stocks clearly offer the highest upside, but the recent loss reminds me that volatility is real—even in a stable market. Real estate remains a strong fallback, especially if we want to reset momentum after a bumpy quarter; it’s not flashy, but it’s reliable. I’m less drawn to bonds or cash right now—they’re just too conservative for our current objectives. For me, the real question is whether we’re ready to swing for upside again, trusting our process to keep us agile if things turn, or if we need another quarter of stability to regroup before taking that shot.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I appreciate how you’ve framed the decision, Joel—the choice really does come down to whether we’re ready to push for upside again or if we should use this quarter to reset momentum with something more stable. Your point about our quarterly adaptability is on target; it gives us room to be bold, but also to regroup if needed. I’d like to hear how others weigh that balance, especially in terms of how much volatility we’re comfortable absorbing at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I think it’s worth emphasizing that our quarterly review process isn’t just a safety net—it’s what actually empowers us to take calculated risks without letting a single setback derail our long-term trajectory. If we’re clear on our triggers for pivoting, I’m comfortable with stocks this quarter, knowing we can always shift gears if the market throws us a curveball.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;That’s a key distinction, Joel—seeing the review process as an enabler, not just a safety net, really shifts the mindset from defensive to proactive. If we’re disciplined about setting clear triggers for when to pivot, I agree that we can be bold with stocks this quarter and stay confident that one setback won’t define our trajectory. I’d like to hear if anyone has concerns about what those triggers should be, or if there are scenarios where we’d want to pull back sooner.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird: &quot;I’d suggest setting objective performance thresholds—say, if stocks underperform by more than 10% in a quarter, we automatically review shifting to real estate for stability. At the same time, we should check in on team sentiment; if confidence drops noticeably, that’s a signal to reassess, even if the numbers aren’t alarming yet. This way, we’re protecting both our capital and our collective mindset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I like the dual approach you’re proposing, Joel—having clear performance thresholds gives us a concrete trigger for reassessment, while monitoring team sentiment ensures we’re not blindsided by psychological fallout. That combination keeps us both accountable and adaptable, which is exactly what we need to manage risk without becoming overly cautious. Let’s see if others have thoughts on what those thresholds should look like, or if there are alternative scenarios we should plan for.&quot;</p><p><br>
Joel Bird chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Erin Fitzpatrick</h4></p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I appreciate the focus on disciplined triggers and team sentiment as part of our risk management—those are essential for staying adaptable. For me, real estate stands out this quarter because it offers predictable returns and serves as a stabilizer after last quarter’s negative swing in stocks. If we prioritize steady progress now, we’ll be better positioned to take bolder risks in future quarters with a stronger foundation and clearer momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;Erin, your point about using real estate as a stabilizer to rebuild momentum is well taken—there’s real value in reinforcing team confidence before taking on more risk. I see how prioritizing steady progress now could set us up for bolder moves later, and I appreciate the emphasis on timing and foundation-building as part of our overall risk management strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I agree that timing and foundation-building are critical—not just for financial outcomes, but for maintaining team morale and cohesion after a setback. By choosing real estate now, we reinforce our commitment to disciplined progress, which I believe will make us more resilient and decisive when the right opportunity for a higher-risk move presents itself.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I appreciate your focus on the connection between disciplined progress and team resilience, Erin. Sequencing our risk-taking—by using real estate to rebuild confidence after a setback—could strengthen our foundation and make us more effective when we do decide to pursue higher-return opportunities. I’d like to hear if others feel the same about timing, or if there’s a case for pressing ahead with a riskier move now given our process safeguards.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick: &quot;I’d add that our ability to pivot each quarter is a real asset, but the discipline to pause and rebuild after volatility is what sets us up for sustainable growth. By sequencing our risk-taking—using real estate as a reset—we keep our options open and our team strong, which ultimately increases our capacity to act boldly when the conditions truly favor it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I think you’re right that our quarterly adaptability is only as valuable as our willingness to use it deliberately—not just to chase returns, but to intentionally regroup when needed. The idea that pausing with real estate now could actually make us bolder and more effective down the line is compelling. I’d like to see if others agree that this disciplined sequencing builds real long-term advantage, or if there’s a risk we become too cautious and miss out on upside by not acting when conditions are stable.&quot;</p><p><br>
Erin Fitzpatrick chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Frances Wheeler</h4></p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree that our quarterly review process is what gives us the freedom to be bold with stocks without letting a single setback define our trajectory. If we’re clear about our performance thresholds and honest about team sentiment, I see this as the right quarter to test our adaptability and pursue higher returns with stocks. Real estate remains a strong fallback if we need to regroup, but given the stable market and our safeguards, I believe the upside of stocks outweighs the risks right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Frances—the discipline of our review process is what gives us the latitude to reach for higher returns with stocks and still maintain control if things don’t go our way. Your point about using clear thresholds and honest sentiment checks is spot on; it’s this structure that lets us be bold now, knowing real estate remains a reliable fallback if we need to pivot. I’d like to hear if anyone feels the risk of another loss outweighs the potential upside, or if our safeguards are enough to justify taking this shot.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I appreciate that, Zane. For me, the key is not just having safeguards in place, but actually using them—if stocks disappoint again, I’m fully prepared to pivot to real estate next quarter without hesitation. That mindset lets us go after upside now, knowing we’re not locked in, and I think it’s a risk worth taking given our process and current market conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Frances—the real value in our process is making sure we actually act on our safeguards, not just talk about them. That willingness to pivot quickly if stocks underperform is what gives us permission to pursue upside now without being reckless. I’d like to see if others feel equally confident in our ability to execute those pivots, or if there are concerns about how we’d manage a string of setbacks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I think our track record so far shows we’re not afraid to pivot when needed, but it’s worth making sure everyone’s genuinely comfortable with that in practice—not just in theory. If anyone has doubts about our ability to pull the trigger quickly after a loss, now’s the time to surface them so we can address those concerns head-on and make sure we’re all aligned before committing to a higher-risk move.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I appreciate you raising this, Frances—making sure everyone is genuinely comfortable with executing a quick pivot is critical if we’re going to take a bold step with stocks. If there are any doubts or hesitations about our ability to act decisively after a loss, I want to hear them now so we can address them together and ensure we’re fully aligned before moving forward. Let’s make sure our confidence in the process is matched by our readiness to use it when it counts.&quot;</p><p><br>
Frances Wheeler: &quot;I agree—aligning on our ability to act quickly is just as important as having the process itself. I’m fully confident in our safeguards and willingness to pivot, but I’d value hearing any specific concerns from others now, so we can move forward with real clarity and unity on whichever option we choose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Raja Moody</h4></p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I see real estate as the most reliable option this quarter for rebuilding momentum after last quarter’s volatility in stocks. While I appreciate the argument that our quarterly review process enables bold moves, I’m cautious about compounding risk so soon after a setback—steady progress now strengthens our foundation and keeps us agile for higher-return opportunities ahead. For me, the disciplined sequencing of risk—using real estate as a reset—offers the best balance of growth, risk management, and adaptability for where we are right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I appreciate your focus on risk sequencing and the value of using real estate as a reset, Raja—it’s a disciplined approach that prioritizes momentum and foundation-building after volatility. Your caution about compounding risk is well taken, and it’s important we weigh whether steady progress now truly puts us in a stronger position for future bold moves. I’d like to hear if others feel we’d miss out on upside by not acting now, or if the benefits of rebuilding with real estate outweigh the risk of another setback.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I think the key is that steady progress with real estate now doesn’t mean we’re giving up on upside—it’s about reinforcing our ability to act boldly when conditions are optimal, rather than reacting to recent volatility. By intentionally rebuilding our foundation, we’re not just managing risk, but also increasing our confidence and clarity for when the right high-return opportunity presents itself.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I see what you’re saying, Raja—using real estate now as a way to reinforce our foundation and build confidence could make us more decisive and effective when the next high-return scenario comes along. It’s a good reminder that steady progress isn’t just about avoiding risk, but about setting ourselves up to act boldly at the right moment. I’d like to hear if anyone thinks we risk losing momentum or missing out by waiting, or if this disciplined approach is the best way to maximize our long-term potential.&quot;</p><p><br>
Raja Moody: &quot;I don’t see steady progress with real estate as a loss of momentum—instead, it’s a strategic pause that preserves our flexibility and positions us to act when a truly compelling upside emerges. By deliberately sequencing stability and risk, we avoid reactionary swings and ensure our next bold move is both timely and well-supported by a strong foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Fiona Blaese</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong perspective on how our disciplined process and adaptability position us to pursue upside with stocks while still managing risk, and I want to build on the group’s insights about sequencing risk and the psychological impact of our choices.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I see our disciplined quarterly review process as the real edge here—it lets us take calculated risks with stocks, knowing we have both objective triggers and team sentiment checks to pivot if things don’t go our way. While I respect the case for using real estate as a stabilizer after a setback, I think our ability to regroup quickly means we don’t have to shy away from upside when the environment is still stable. For me, this is the right quarter to test our adaptability and pursue growth, trusting our process to keep us resilient and ready to reset if needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I agree, Fiona—our disciplined review process is what gives us the confidence to pursue growth with stocks while staying ready to regroup if needed. Your point about using objective triggers and sentiment checks to manage downside risk is exactly how we turn adaptability into a real advantage. I’d like to hear if others feel this level of process discipline is enough to justify another bold move now, or if there are lingering concerns about compounding risk so soon after last quarter’s setback.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly engages with my argument and invites further integration of perspectives, especially regarding process discipline and group comfort with risk. I can add nuance by highlighting how our agreed safeguards not only support bold moves, but also actively protect team cohesion even after setbacks—helping bridge the gap between risk-takers and those favoring stability.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I appreciate you raising that, Zane. For me, our safeguards—objective triggers and sentiment checks—aren’t just theoretical; they’re practical tools that keep us aligned and responsive, even if we hit another rough patch. I’m confident that this structure gives us real permission to pursue upside now, knowing we have the discipline and collective buy-in to pivot quickly if needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I appreciate your confidence in our safeguards, Fiona—treating objective triggers and sentiment checks as real, actionable tools is what turns our adaptability from theory into practice. That level of discipline is exactly what gives me comfort in taking calculated risks with stocks now, knowing we’re equipped to pivot quickly if things don’t go as planned. I’d like to hear if anyone sees gaps in our safeguards, or if there are additional scenarios we should plan for to make sure our process holds up under pressure.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s question about potential gaps in our safeguards is important for ensuring our process is robust under pressure, and I can add value by encouraging open discussion about any blind spots or stress points we might have overlooked.</p><p><br>
Fiona Blaese: &quot;I think it’s worth explicitly inviting any concerns about where our safeguards could break down—whether that’s in communication, decision speed, or team morale after a tough quarter. If anyone has doubts or sees scenarios we haven’t planned for, now’s the time to surface them so we can strengthen our process and move forward with full confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco: &quot;I appreciate you calling this out, Fiona—anticipating where our safeguards might break down is exactly the kind of thinking that strengthens our process. If anyone has specific concerns about our ability to communicate quickly, make timely decisions, or maintain morale after a tough quarter, now’s the time to raise them. Let’s make sure we’ve stress-tested our protocols and that everyone is genuinely confident in our ability to execute before we finalize our direction for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I’ve fully articulated my perspective on the importance of robust safeguards and encouraged the group to surface any remaining concerns; at this point, it’s best to listen and integrate others’ input before finalizing my position.</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco summarized: &quot;Zane Pacheco **Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3 – Round 2 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Theme and Objective**  <br>
This round focused on risk-reward analysis and scenario planning for each asset option. The objective was to identify and evaluate the specific risks, potential returns, and adaptability of each asset given our current stable market conditions and company objectives, with the goal of informing a disciplined, well-supported investment decision for this quarter.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- **Stocks:**  <br>
  - *Supporters:* Frances Wheeler, Fiona Blaese (aligned with my perspective)  <br>
  - *Viewpoints:* Stocks are favored for their upside potential despite recent volatility. Supporters argue our disciplined quarterly review process—anchored by objective performance thresholds and team sentiment checks—enables us to pursue higher returns while managing risk. There is strong confidence that adaptability and readiness to pivot if stocks underperform justify taking a bold position now.<br>
- **Real Estate:**  <br>
  - *Supporters:* Erin Fitzpatrick, Raja Moody  <br>
  - *Viewpoints:* Real estate is seen as the most reliable option for rebuilding momentum and team confidence after last quarter’s loss in stocks. Supporters emphasize the importance of disciplined sequencing—using real estate as a stabilizer and “reset” to lay a stronger foundation for future high-return opportunities. They caution against compounding risk too soon and stress that steady progress now increases our capacity for bold action later.<br>
- **Balanced/Process-Focused:**  <br>
  - *Supporters:* Joel Bird (with input from multiple shareholders)  <br>
  - *Viewpoints:* Joel highlights that our quarterly adaptability is not just a safety net but an enabler for calculated risk-taking. He advocates for clear, objective performance triggers (e.g., pivoting if stocks underperform by more than 10%) and regular team sentiment checks to ensure we remain both accountable and agile. This approach is widely recognized as essential for managing both financial and psychological risks.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Arguments and Evidence Presented**  <br>
- *Stocks:*  <br>
  - Offer the highest upside in stable conditions but come with real volatility, as evidenced by last quarter’s loss.  <br>
  - The quarterly review process, supported by objective thresholds and sentiment monitoring, is seen as a robust safeguard enabling bold moves.  <br>
  - Confidence in the process and a willingness to act on triggers are viewed as critical for justifying another attempt at upside.<br>
- *Real Estate:*  <br>
  - Provides steady, predictable returns and serves as a stabilizer after volatility.  <br>
  - Strategic use as a “reset” is valued for rebuilding momentum, foundation, and morale.  <br>
  - Disciplined sequencing of risk is framed as a prudent way to maximize long-term growth and resilience.<br>
- *Bonds and Cash:*  <br>
  - Universally viewed as too conservative for current objectives; not seriously advocated by any shareholder.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- *Consensus:*  <br>
  - The quarterly review process—especially the use of objective triggers and sentiment checks—is a core strength that enables both boldness and discipline.  <br>
  - Cash and bonds remain unattractive given our growth objectives and the stable market context.<br>
- *Disagreement:*  <br>
  - Whether to pursue the upside of stocks immediately, leveraging our process safeguards, or to prioritize stability with real estate to rebuild momentum before taking on additional risk.  <br>
  - The optimal sequencing of risk-taking and how best to balance ambition with team cohesion and resilience.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
We have made substantial progress in surfacing and evaluating the nuanced risks, returns, and adaptability of stocks and real estate in the current environment. The discussion has deepened our collective understanding of how disciplined process, clear triggers, and team sentiment monitoring can both enable and constrain bold moves. There is now explicit recognition of the psychological and strategic value of sequencing risk, as well as the practical safeguards that support adaptability. Remaining divergence centers on risk appetite and timing, not on the merits of the process itself.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from the predefined options: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, or &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. All discussion remained focused within these boundaries, and no invalid options were proposed.</p><p>7. **Next Steps / Issues to Address**  <br>
In the next round, we should synthesize the most valuable insights from this analysis, address any remaining objections or concerns—particularly around our practical ability to execute pivots and maintain morale—and move the group toward consensus on the asset that best balances growth, risk, and adaptability for this quarter. Special attention should be given to ensuring our safeguards are robust and that all shareholders are genuinely aligned on both the process and the chosen direction before proceeding to a formal vote.&quot;</p><p><br>

Joel’s proposal for clear performance thresholds and sentiment checks added practical substance to our ability to pivot, making me even more confident in our adaptability.

- Frances Wheeler: Approve - I believe stocks are the right call this quarter—the upside is there, and our disciplined review process, clear triggers, and team sentiment checks give us the flexibility to manage risk and pivot quickly if needed. I’m confident that our team’s adaptability and commitment to process discipline make this a calculated, not reckless, move. This is the kind of bold, pragmatic action that keeps us learning, growing, and ready for whatever comes next.<br>
- Joel Bird: Approve - I’m confident that stocks are the right call for us this quarter. Our disciplined review process and clear safeguards let us chase upside without losing our heads, and I trust we’ll pivot fast if results or morale demand it. This is the kind of calculated risk that keeps us sharp and moving forward as a team.<br>
- Fiona Blaese: Approve - I support investing in stocks this quarter because our disciplined review process and objective triggers give us the confidence to pursue meaningful upside while staying agile if things shift. This is the right moment to lean into our adaptability and growth mindset, and I trust our safeguards to keep us resilient and aligned as a team.<br>
- Raja Moody: Reject - While I recognize the upside potential of stocks and appreciate the safeguards built into our review process, I believe the timing is premature given last quarter’s volatility. Real estate offers a more reliable path to rebuild momentum and reinforce our foundation, ensuring disciplined progress before taking on additional risk.<br>
- Erin Fitzpatrick: Reject - I appreciate the thorough analysis and the safeguards our process provides, but I believe investing in stocks this quarter compounds risk too soon after our recent loss.

Our stable market, strong foundation, and disciplined review protocols give us the flexibility to pursue higher returns while managing risk, and the team’s willingness to embrace adaptability reassures me that we’re prepared to learn and pivot if needed. This is the right moment to act boldly and set the tone for a growth-oriented, resilient company culture.</p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Conclusion</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Zane Pacheco made the following closing statement:</p><p>&quot;Zane Pacheco appreciates the team’s willingness to engage in open, focused debate and challenge assumptions throughout this process. We made real progress by surfacing both the upside and psychological risks, and I’m encouraged by how our quarterly review protocols have become a genuine strength—enabling us to take calculated risks without losing our discipline. Still, there’s room to sharpen how we invite dissent and formalize scenario analysis earlier, so we’re not blindsided by unexpected shifts. In the coming year, I’m committed to tightening our performance triggers, actively seeking out contrarian views, and making sure we’re ready to pivot fast if conditions change. Let’s keep pushing boundaries, stay sharp, and continue building a culture that’s both bold and resilient.&quot;</p><p>The meeting concluded with Stocks as the approved decision.</p><p><br>

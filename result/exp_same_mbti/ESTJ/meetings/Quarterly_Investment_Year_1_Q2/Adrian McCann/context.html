<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During the annual budget meeting for Year 1, I consistently advocated for Option A, which proposes allocating 50% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. My position centered on maintaining a conservative allocation to preserve cash reserves, thereby supporting stability and flexibility as we establish the company’s operational foundation. I emphasized the importance of building internal processes and operational discipline gradually before committing fully to capital deployment.</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman acknowledged my concerns and the merit of preserving a financial buffer for risk management and process maturity, though he maintained his preference for Option C—allocating 100% of funds evenly across all quarters—citing the stable market environment and the benefits of maximizing capital deployment. Other shareholders mostly aligned with the CEO’s view favoring Option C, though Vincent Adams shared my cautious stance.</p><p>The final vote resulted in Option C being approved with five out of six votes (83.3%). I cast the sole dissenting vote, maintaining that Option A better balances risk management and long-term resilience for our inaugural year. Although my preferred option was not adopted, the CEO’s recognition of my points lent legitimacy to the conservative approach within the broader discussion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>The CEO demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the meeting’s objectives, setting defined parameters for discussion, and encouraging diverse perspectives. For example, Gavin Roman effectively summarized shareholder viewpoints after each round, highlighting areas of consensus and disagreement, which helped maintain focus and structure in the dialogue. His openness to acknowledging the validity of my cautious approach—despite favoring a different option—showed adaptability and respect for shareholder input.</p><p>However, the CEO could improve by more explicitly addressing dissenting perspectives during the final proposal phase to further integrate minority views. While his structured process was effective, reinforcing the rationale behind balancing growth with flexibility in the final recommendation might have helped bridge the divide between conservative and growth-oriented shareholders.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process functioned well, fostering thorough discussion and iterative reflection over two rounds before moving to a vote. The structured format, including the CEO’s summaries and invitations for continuing exchange, ensured all voices were heard and that members could reassess their positions based on shared insights.</p><p>Overall, the final decision to adopt Option C appears sound given the stable market and the majority’s preference for disciplined full deployment paired with quarterly reviews for adaptability. The approach balances immediate capital productivity with mechanisms for ongoing learning and course correction, which should support the company’s growth and operational rigor in its first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced that decision-making dynamics in our shareholder group value both disciplined execution and flexibility, with a healthy tension between maximizing returns and preserving adaptability. I learned that while caution is respected, the prevailing culture favors assertive, structured action supplemented by regular review mechanisms.</p><p>In future meetings, I might adjust my approach by more explicitly linking conservative positions with measurable operational milestones or contingency triggers to better align risk management with the group’s appetite for disciplined growth. Emphasizing how phased approaches can incorporate structured reviews—similar to Option C’s quarterly checkpoints—may help bridge perspectives more effectively.</p><p>I observed a pattern where arguments grounded in operational culture and long-term resilience resonate strongly, especially when paired with clear mechanisms for adaptability. Recognizing this, I will focus on framing future contributions around how risk management strategies shape company culture and decision-making processes over time.</p><p>Key takeaways include the importance of balancing immediate financial objectives with foundational process development, the value of structured yet flexible frameworks for execution, and the need to articulate how conservative strategies contribute to sustainable growth without stifling momentum. These insights will guide my participation to foster thoughtful, pragmatic decisions that serve the company’s stability and long-term success.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Adrian McCann’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I initially advocated for investing in bonds, emphasizing capital preservation and operational discipline as the company’s first step in a stable market. I consistently argued that bonds offer a low to medium risk-return profile suitable for establishing foundational processes without exposing the company to undue volatility. Throughout the discussion, I engaged constructively with CEO Gavin Roman, who initially favored stocks for their growth potential but demonstrated openness to integrating risk management considerations. Our dialogue acknowledged the need for sequencing risk exposure thoughtfully.</p><p>Other shareholders presented a spectrum of views: Sara Burke and the CEO favored stocks, while Robyn Duncan, Antonio Sherman, and Vincent Adams supported real estate as a balanced, moderate-risk option. Over the course of two rounds, I noted increasing support for real estate’s operational learning benefits and steady returns, which influenced my reassessment.</p><p>The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of investing in real estate. This outcome aligned with a majority consensus and reflected the integration of operational benchmarks and risk oversight measures I advocated. Though my initial preference for bonds was not adopted, my position evolved to support real estate as the most balanced inaugural investment.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman led the meeting with clear structure and purpose, effectively framing the thematic rounds to build consensus. His initial presentation of each asset’s theoretical risk-return profile set a solid analytical foundation. For example, his summaries after each round adeptly synthesized diverse shareholder viewpoints, reinforcing focus and encouraging further reflection.</p><p>The CEO’s openness to integrating minority perspectives, especially my emphasis on operational discipline and risk management, demonstrated adaptive leadership. His shift from favoring stocks to endorsing real estate as the inaugural investment showed responsiveness to shareholder input.</p><p>Areas for improvement include more proactive facilitation of minority opinions during final decision phases to ensure all concerns are explicitly addressed before voting. While the decision-making process was thorough and well-structured, earlier and more explicit integration of dissenting views could enhance shared ownership.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process functioned effectively, fostering comprehensive discussion across two rounds, with clear objectives and summaries guiding progress. The unanimous approval of real estate, accompanied by defined operational benchmarks and review processes, represents a prudent and balanced decision that supports both growth and risk management in a stable market.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing ambition with discipline in our investment strategy. I learned that while conservative positions centered on capital preservation are respected, the group increasingly values structured approaches that allow moderate risk-taking paired with operational learning.</p><p>In future meetings, I will aim to more explicitly connect my risk management stance with measurable operational milestones and safeguards, as this framing resonated well and facilitated constructive convergence. Emphasizing how phased risk exposure aligns with both discipline and growth objectives appears to be an effective approach.</p><p>A key pattern observed is the group’s preference for investment options that combine steady returns with opportunities for process development and accountability. Recognizing this, I will continue to advocate for frameworks that embed clear benchmarks, transparent reporting, and regular reviews to ensure adaptability and operational rigor.</p><p>My key takeaway is that effective shareholder engagement requires presenting risk-conscious arguments within a broader narrative of disciplined growth and measurable outcomes. This insight will guide my future participation to contribute pragmatically toward decisions that strengthen the company’s stability and long-term success.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Gavin Roman Historical data indicates that stocks have delivered the highest average returns at 20%, but with correspondingly higher volatility and risk, which may not align with our current need for operational stability. Real estate has consistently provided moderate, reliable returns of 10%, offering a disciplined balance between growth and risk—a pattern well-suited to our present stable market environment. Bonds and cash, while lower-yielding at 5% and 2% respectively, offer strong capital preservation but may limit our ability to build momentum and credibility as a new investment company.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Adrian McCann CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 40%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I approach this decision with a strong preference for stability, disciplined risk management, and consistent returns. Real estate continues to offer a reliable balance of moderate risk and steady appreciation, which aligns well with our company’s need for operational learning and credibility at this early stage. Bonds are also attractive for their low volatility and capital preservation, but their lower returns may not sufficiently support our growth objectives in a stable market. While stocks have shown the highest returns, the associated volatility is not justified given our current priorities. Real estate remains the most prudent option, provided we maintain clear benchmarks and regular performance reviews.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Review of Q1 investment outcomes and historical asset performance | Expected outcome: Establish a factual, shared understanding of how each asset has performed in our stable market context, including lessons learned from our Q1 real estate investment&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because in this stable market, my structured analysis leads me to prioritize real estate for its consistent, moderate returns and lower volatility compared to stocks. Our Q1 investment in real estate delivered a reliable 10% return, reinforcing its suitability as a disciplined, growth-oriented choice that aligns with our need for operational stability and credibility as a new company. For this round, we will review Q1 investment outcomes and historical asset performance to establish a factual, shared understanding of how each asset has performed, and draw lessons from our real estate investment. I encourage everyone to contribute perspectives that might challenge or enhance our current assessment, so we can synthesize the most complete view possible. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;Our Q1 investment in real estate yielded a steady 10% return, which confirms its reliability and suitability for our growth objectives in this stable market. While stocks have historically delivered higher returns at 20%, their greater volatility introduces risks that may not be prudent at this early stage when operational stability and credibility are critical. Bonds and cash offer strong capital preservation but would limit our momentum; real estate continues to provide the best balance of moderate risk, steady growth, and operational learning for our company’s current needs.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Antonio. I agree that our Q1 experience validates real estate’s reliability in this environment, and your emphasis on balancing steady growth with operational learning is particularly relevant for our stage as a company. Your point about the prudence of moderating risk at this early phase, despite the higher returns of stocks, is well taken and supports a disciplined approach as we continue to build our credibility.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment of the importance of operational learning at this stage. As we continue to build our processes and track record, maintaining a disciplined approach with real estate gives us the foundation to revisit higher-risk options like stocks in future quarters, once we have more robust systems in place to manage volatility. This phased approach strengthens our ability to adapt as the company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;I appreciate your focus on building a strong foundation before increasing our risk profile. This phased approach—prioritizing operational learning and disciplined execution now, with openness to higher-return options like stocks as our systems mature—reflects sound strategic thinking. It’s important that we continue to align our investment choices with both our immediate capabilities and our long-term growth ambitions.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I agree—by demonstrating consistent, disciplined execution through real estate, we not only manage risk today but also build credibility and operational maturity that will serve us well when considering higher-return options like stocks in the future. This approach ensures we’re not just reacting to market conditions, but proactively preparing the company to capitalize on new opportunities as our capabilities evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;Our Q1 experience with real estate reinforces my view that it offers the right balance of moderate risk and reliable returns, especially as we work to establish a credible track record in this stable environment. While stocks’ higher returns are tempting, I believe the steadiness and operational learning real estate provides are more valuable at this formative stage. Building on Antonio’s point, maintaining this disciplined approach positions us to take on greater risk in the future, once our systems and processes are more robust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. Your focus on operational learning and the importance of establishing a credible track record at this stage is well aligned with our objectives. I agree that by maintaining discipline and prioritizing steady, reliable returns now, we are positioning ourselves to confidently pursue higher-return opportunities like stocks once our internal processes and systems are more mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on future flexibility, Gavin. By demonstrating consistent, disciplined results with real estate now, we’re not only building credibility but also developing the operational maturity needed to confidently consider higher-return options like stocks as our capabilities grow. This approach ensures we’re balancing immediate stability with long-term adaptability—both of which are essential for sustainable company growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. I agree that by focusing on disciplined, consistent execution now, we’re not only safeguarding immediate stability but also laying the groundwork for adaptability as we grow. Your emphasis on developing operational maturity before pursuing higher-return options like stocks is a valuable reminder that sustainable growth depends on both credibility and readiness to manage increased risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I’d also add that our shared commitment to disciplined, consistent execution with real estate helps unify the team around clear goals, making it easier to evaluate and adapt our strategy as new data emerges. By embedding both stability and adaptability into our investment process, we’re setting a precedent that encourages thoughtful risk-taking when the company is truly prepared for it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I agree with the points raised so far—our Q1 real estate investment provided a reliable 10% return, which validates its role as a disciplined, moderate-risk choice that aligns with both our operational objectives and the need to build credibility. While stocks offer higher potential returns, I remain cautious about introducing greater volatility at this early stage; real estate’s consistent performance allows us to strengthen our processes and reputation before considering riskier assets.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. Your point about using real estate’s reliability to strengthen our operational processes and reputation is well taken, especially as we lay the groundwork for future growth. I agree that maintaining a disciplined approach at this stage allows us to continue building credibility and operational rigor before considering higher-volatility options like stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on operational rigor, Gavin. I’d add that by prioritizing steady, fact-based progress now—especially through assets like real estate—we not only build our credibility but also create the flexibility to adapt our strategy as our systems mature. This disciplined foundation will position us well to confidently evaluate higher-return options in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. I agree that maintaining disciplined, fact-based progress through reliable assets like real estate strengthens both our credibility and our ability to adapt as we develop. Your point about building a foundation for future flexibility is well made—by prioritizing operational rigor now, we’re ensuring that when the time is right, we can confidently pursue higher-return opportunities with the systems and experience to manage them effectively.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;Our Q1 investment in real estate gave us exactly what we needed: a solid, predictable return that’s helped lay a strong foundation for our company’s credibility and operational discipline. While the 20% return from stocks is enticing, I see real estate as the bedrock—steady and reliable, like building on granite instead of sand—ensuring we don’t outrun our processes before they’re truly tested. As we review these outcomes, I believe sticking with real estate for now reinforces both our discipline and our readiness to pursue bigger risks once our operational engine is running at full steam.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your analogy of real estate as the bedrock for our company is apt—our Q1 outcome demonstrates how steady, predictable returns support both credibility and operational discipline at this formative stage. I agree that maintaining this disciplined approach allows us to develop the necessary processes and readiness to pursue higher-return opportunities like stocks when our operational engine is truly prepared.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your focus on operational discipline, Gavin. I’d add that by consistently choosing assets like real estate now, we’re not only building credibility but also giving ourselves the operational runway to confidently pivot to higher-return options like stocks when the time is right. In other words, discipline today is what fuels our flexibility tomorrow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. I agree that disciplined execution with real estate not only strengthens our credibility now but also equips us with the operational capacity to pivot confidently when higher-return opportunities become appropriate. Your point that today’s discipline is the foundation for tomorrow’s flexibility is well taken, and it reinforces the strategic value of our current approach as we build toward future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I’m glad to see alignment on this, Gavin. I’d also highlight that this disciplined, fact-driven path with real estate isn’t just about process—it’s about building shared confidence across the team. When everyone sees that our strategy delivers steady results, it becomes much easier to rally behind bold moves down the line, knowing our foundation is strong and our judgment sound.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute regarding the importance of disciplined, risk-managed investment, and I want to reinforce the value of steady operational learning from our Q1 real estate experience while acknowledging the factual performance data.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I believe our Q1 real estate investment has validated the importance of balancing moderate risk with steady, reliable returns, especially as we work to establish operational discipline and credibility. While historical data shows stocks outperformed in absolute terms, the lower volatility and consistent outcomes from real estate align more closely with our current need for stability and process development. Maintaining this disciplined approach will allow us to build a solid foundation and adapt thoughtfully as our capabilities mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. Your emphasis on balancing moderate risk with steady, reliable returns captures the essence of what we need as a developing company. I agree that real estate’s lower volatility and consistent outcomes are particularly well-suited to building operational discipline and credibility, and your point about maintaining this approach as a foundation for future adaptability is well taken.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response aligns closely with my perspective, but I see an opportunity to further integrate the value of operational learning with the need for adaptable processes, helping clarify how our disciplined approach today sets the stage for responsible risk-taking in the future.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the connection between steady returns and operational discipline. I’d add that by embedding clear performance benchmarks and regular review processes into our real estate strategy, we not only safeguard stability now but also develop the frameworks necessary to confidently evaluate higher-risk options like stocks when our operational maturity allows. This approach ensures we’re building both resilience and readiness for future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. I agree that integrating explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews into our real estate strategy will not only reinforce our current stability but also position us to assess higher-risk opportunities like stocks with greater confidence as our operational maturity develops. Your focus on building both resilience and readiness is a valuable addition to our collective approach, and I believe it strengthens the case for maintaining disciplined execution as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response fully acknowledges and builds upon my points, and further exchange would risk redundancy rather than advancing the discussion.</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Adrian McCann UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 70%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s unanimous support for real estate, reinforced by Q1’s reliable 10% return and the asset’s alignment with our operational discipline and credibility-building objectives, has strengthened my confidence. The CEO and multiple shareholders emphasized that real estate’s moderate risk and steady returns are especially valuable at our formative stage, and the discussion around embedding performance benchmarks and regular reviews further validated my focus on structured, risk-managed growth. The consensus that stocks, while higher-yielding, are better reserved for future quarters when our processes are more mature, also influenced my reduced confidence in riskier options.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved to more fully appreciate the importance of group alignment and operational learning at this stage. While I still value risk management and flexibility, the discussion helped me recognize that a disciplined, real estate-focused approach—paired with explicit benchmarks and reviews—offers both stability and a foundation for future adaptability. The shared rationale across the team has made me more confident in moving from a cautious balance toward a stronger preference for real estate this quarter.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: The consistent, moderate returns of real estate, validated by our Q1 experience and aligned with our need for operational discipline, make it the most prudent choice for this quarter. The group’s consensus and the CEO’s emphasis on embedding structured reviews and benchmarks further assure me that we can manage risk while building credibility and readiness for future, higher-risk investments. This disciplined approach supports both our immediate stability and our long-term growth objectives.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus and alignment around real estate as the preferred asset for Q2, I believe an additional round focused on structured risk assessment and alignment with our company objectives will further strengthen our decision. This next round will allow us to clarify specific performance benchmarks, review processes, and address any residual uncertainties regarding risk tolerance and operational priorities. By ensuring these details are thoroughly explored, we reinforce our disciplined approach and position the company for both immediate stability and future adaptability. This demonstrates a commitment to thoroughness and operational excellence before moving to a final proposal and vote.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Risk assessment and alignment with company objectives | Expected outcome: Clarify the risk-return profiles of each asset in relation to our current operational priorities and risk tolerance, surfacing any uncertainties or concerns about repeating or changing our Q1 approach&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because the round reinforced that real estate offers the optimal balance of moderate risk, reliable returns, and operational learning in this stable market. The unanimous shareholder support, combined with strong reasoning about discipline, credibility, and phased risk-taking, has deepened my confidence that this is the right path for Q2. Real estate’s performance aligns directly with our company’s immediate needs and long-term ambitions, and the group’s commitment to structured execution means we are well-positioned to adapt as we mature, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, our focus is a structured risk assessment and alignment with company objectives: we need to clarify the risk-return profiles of each asset in relation to our operational priorities and risk tolerance, and surface any uncertainties about repeating or changing our Q1 approach. By thoughtfully examining these factors together, we can ensure our decision reflects both discipline and adaptability, integrating diverse insights for a stronger outcome. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any perspectives or concerns that could further strengthen our understanding and help us make the most informed decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;In my view, real estate continues to offer the best alignment with our operational priorities—its moderate, reliable returns support steady growth and process development without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. While bonds provide strong capital preservation, their lower returns may not sustain our momentum at this stage, and stocks, though attractive for future growth, carry more risk than I believe is prudent right now. I’m confident that maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate this quarter best supports both our immediate objectives and positions us for greater flexibility as we mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. Your emphasis on steady growth, process development, and prudent risk management captures the core of our operational priorities at this stage. I agree that maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate allows us to build credibility and capability now, while preserving the flexibility to pursue higher-return options like stocks as our systems mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment, Gavin. To further strengthen our approach, I suggest we continue embedding clear performance benchmarks and transparent quarterly reviews into our real estate strategy—this will help us monitor risk, reinforce accountability, and ensure we remain agile as market conditions or company priorities evolve. This added structure gives me confidence that we can maintain both discipline and adaptability as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. I fully agree that embedding explicit performance benchmarks and maintaining transparent quarterly reviews will be essential for disciplined execution and ongoing adaptability. This structure not only reinforces our risk management but also ensures we remain responsive to evolving priorities, further strengthening our real estate strategy as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I remain strongly in favor of real estate for this quarter, as its moderate risk and reliable returns directly support our need for steady growth and operational discipline at this early stage. While stocks offer higher upside, I believe their volatility doesn’t align with our current tolerance, and bonds or cash would limit our momentum. Embedding clear benchmarks and regular reviews into our real estate investment will help us manage risk and ensure we’re well-positioned to adapt as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Antonio. Your focus on steady growth, operational discipline, and the importance of embedding clear benchmarks and reviews directly supports our objectives for this quarter. I agree that maintaining this structure within our real estate investment will help us manage risk effectively and ensure we remain agile as our company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by treating our benchmarks and reviews not just as compliance tools but as proactive mechanisms for early course correction, we can maintain both discipline and agility. This approach will help us identify shifts in risk or opportunity promptly, strengthening our ability to deliver consistent results as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, Antonio. Treating our benchmarks and reviews as proactive mechanisms for early course correction, rather than just compliance, will indeed strengthen our ability to identify and respond to emerging risks or opportunities. This mindset ensures we remain both disciplined and agile, supporting consistent results and sustained company growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the best fit for our current objectives—its moderate, reliable returns support steady growth and operational learning, while the clear benchmarks and review processes we’ve discussed ensure we remain disciplined and adaptable. While stocks may offer higher returns, their volatility doesn’t align with our present risk tolerance or need for stability as a young company. I’m confident that maintaining our focus on real estate, with strong accountability measures, positions us well for sustainable progress and future flexibility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. Your emphasis on strong accountability measures and the alignment between real estate’s steady returns and our current risk tolerance is well taken. I agree that maintaining discipline through clear benchmarks and review processes not only supports our immediate objectives but also ensures we’re well-positioned for future flexibility as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by consistently treating our benchmarks and reviews as opportunities for learning and process refinement—not just risk controls—we foster a culture that supports both operational excellence and adaptability. This mindset will be crucial as we eventually consider transitioning to higher-return options like stocks in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. I fully agree that treating our benchmarks and reviews as ongoing opportunities for learning and process refinement is essential for building a culture of operational excellence and adaptability. This proactive mindset will not only strengthen our real estate strategy now, but also prepare us to confidently pursue higher-return options like stocks as our capabilities and risk tolerance evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see real estate as the ballast in our ship—steady, reliable, and exactly what we need to keep our course true as we build operational muscle and credibility. While stocks may offer more wind in our sails, I believe it’s prudent to stay anchored in real estate for now, provided we embed explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews to ensure we’re not missing opportunities to adapt as conditions or our capabilities change. This approach lets us grow with discipline, keeping our options open for bolder moves once our foundation is truly solid.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your analogy of real estate as the ballast in our ship resonates strongly with our current stage—steady, reliable, and foundational for building operational strength. I fully agree that embedding explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews is critical to ensuring we remain disciplined while retaining the agility to adapt as market conditions or our capabilities evolve, positioning us well for future opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by treating each review as both a safeguard and a springboard, we’re not just minimizing downside—we’re actively building the operational confidence and institutional knowledge needed to seize higher-return opportunities like stocks when the time is right. This dual focus on discipline and readiness will serve as our competitive edge as we mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. I agree that viewing our reviews as both safeguards and springboards is key—this dual focus enables us to minimize downside risk while actively building the operational confidence and institutional knowledge we’ll need for future, higher-return investments like stocks. By maintaining this balance between discipline and readiness, we create a strong foundation for sustainable growth and a clear pathway to capitalize on greater opportunities as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to reinforce the rationale behind continuing with real estate by clearly articulating its risk-return profile in relation to our current operational priorities and risk tolerance, while acknowledging the value of embedding structured benchmarks and reviews as raised by others.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I remain convinced that real estate best aligns with our operational priorities at this stage—it offers moderate, reliable returns that support disciplined growth without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. Embedding explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews, as several have noted, will ensure we maintain both discipline and the flexibility to adapt as our capabilities mature. This approach balances prudent risk management with the steady progress our company needs to build credibility and operational strength for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. Your emphasis on balancing prudent risk management with steady progress aligns closely with our operational priorities at this stage. I fully agree that embedding explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews will ensure we maintain both discipline and the flexibility to adapt as our company matures, supporting our credibility and long-term strength.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response aligns with my perspective, but I see value in explicitly connecting our structured approach to real estate with the group’s longer-term ambition to eventually pursue higher-return options like stocks. Highlighting how our current discipline lays the groundwork for future adaptability could further strengthen collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by treating these benchmarks and reviews as proactive tools for learning and process refinement, we’re not only managing risk in real estate today but also equipping ourselves to confidently consider higher-return options like stocks as our systems and risk tolerance evolve. This structured approach ensures we’re building both immediate stability and long-term flexibility into our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. I fully agree that leveraging our benchmarks and reviews as proactive tools for learning and process refinement is essential—not just for managing risk today, but for equipping ourselves to pursue higher-return options like stocks as our systems and risk tolerance evolve. This structured approach builds immediate stability while laying the groundwork for long-term flexibility and growth, which is exactly the discipline and adaptability we need at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response fully integrates and reinforces my perspective, and further discussion would likely be redundant rather than additive.</p><p><br>

CEO Gavin Roman decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We have achieved unanimous and well-reasoned consensus around real estate as the optimal investment for Q2, with every shareholder providing thoughtful, detailed support for this approach. The group has not only validated the risk-return rationale but has also collectively emphasized the importance of embedding explicit performance benchmarks and transparent quarterly reviews to ensure disciplined execution, accountability, and adaptability. No unresolved objections or uncertainties remain, and further discussion would yield diminishing returns. I am confident that we are fully prepared to move forward with a formal proposal and vote, demonstrating disciplined, decisive leadership and operational excellence.</p><p><br>

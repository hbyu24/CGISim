<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Robyn Duncan’s Structured Reflection on the Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C—the full 100% allocation of funds evenly distributed across the four quarters—as the optimal strategy given the stable market environment. I positioned this option as the most balanced and disciplined approach to maximize growth potential while maintaining effective risk management. Throughout our discussions, I emphasized the importance of coupling full capital deployment with flexibility through quarterly reviews to allow adaptability as conditions evolve. The CEO, Gavin Roman, responded positively to my input, acknowledging the strength of the rationale behind Option C and appreciating my openness to alternative perspectives, particularly regarding the need for flexibility and monitoring. Other shareholders largely aligned with my position, although Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams voiced support for the more conservative Option A, prioritizing cash reserves and operational caution. Ultimately, the vote favored Option C with 5 out of 6 votes, including mine, approving it as the final company decision. While my preferred option was adopted, I noted increased recognition of the value of flexibility and operational learning voiced by some shareholders, which slightly moderated my confidence distribution but did not change my stance.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman led the meeting with clear, structured guidance, setting precise themes for each discussion round and encouraging open yet focused dialogue within predefined options. He excelled in synthesizing shareholder input, integrating diverse viewpoints into his summaries, and highlighting the operational and cultural implications of our choices. For example, his detailed summaries after each round framed the trade-offs between disciplined execution and flexibility, fostering shared understanding and progress toward consensus. However, the CEO could improve by more proactively addressing dissenting voices during discussions to ensure concerns are fully resolved rather than deferred. The decision-making process itself was methodical and transparent, with structured rounds and summaries that allowed shareholders to reflect and adjust positions thoughtfully. The final decision for Option C aligns well with the company’s current stable market conditions and growth objectives while embedding mechanisms for ongoing adaptability. I believe this decision is prudent and positions the company to build operational credibility and resilience in its first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing decisive, disciplined action with operational flexibility—particularly in a company’s formative year. I learned that while a majority may favor aggressive capital deployment to maximize returns, acknowledging and integrating concerns about adaptability and process-building strengthens collective decision-making and buy-in. Moving forward, I plan to more explicitly highlight how structured approaches, like Option C’s quarterly allocations, can serve as built-in safeguards for flexibility and learning, helping bridge divides between growth-oriented and cautious perspectives. I also observed a pattern where shareholders value both immediate financial outcomes and the cultural precedents set by early decisions; emphasizing this dual impact can help predict support for proposals. Key takeaways include the value of clear, evidence-based arguments, openness to nuance, and the merit of structured synthesis in guiding complex group decisions. These insights will influence me to communicate more holistically—balancing quantitative rationale with cultural and long-term operational considerations—in future meetings to foster stronger consensus and effective outcomes.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Robyn Duncan’s Structured Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my firm position advocating for Real Estate as the inaugural investment choice, emphasizing its balanced risk-return profile and its suitability for establishing operational credibility in a stable market environment. I consistently highlighted that Real Estate offers moderate growth potential while minimizing exposure to undue volatility, which aligns with our company’s priority of disciplined, sustainable growth. Throughout the discussions, CEO Gavin Roman acknowledged and incorporated my perspective, noting the value of Real Estate in providing a middle ground and supporting operational learning. Other shareholders largely converged toward this view as well, with Antonio Sherman and Vincent Adams reinforcing the merits of Real Estate, while Adrian McCann, initially favoring Bonds, became open to Real Estate contingent on clear benchmarks. Sara Burke, while advocating for Stocks, accepted Real Estate as a strong alternative. The CEO’s final proposal favored Real Estate, and the vote concluded with unanimous approval (6/6 votes), fully adopting my preferred option for the quarter’s investment.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman demonstrated strong leadership by structuring the meeting into focused rounds that fostered thorough exploration of differing viewpoints and risk-return assessments. His ability to synthesize shareholder input—particularly my emphasis on operational discipline and credibility-building through Real Estate—helped the group coalesce around a balanced investment strategy. The CEO’s openness to shifting his initial preference from Stocks toward Real Estate, based on collective rationale, reflects commendable adaptability and inclusiveness. However, while his facilitation was effective, there remains room to proactively engage dissenting voices earlier in the discussion to preempt lingering uncertainties. The company’s decision-making process was methodical, transparent, and iterative, incorporating clear summaries and encouraging contributions aligned with predefined options. The unanimous adoption of Real Estate, accompanied by detailed operational benchmarks and transparent review commitments, appears well-calibrated for our company’s formative stage. This decision balances growth ambition with prudent risk management, positioning the company for sustainable, credible progress.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the critical importance of balancing ambition with discipline when making foundational investment decisions. I learned that articulating how a moderate-risk asset like Real Estate can serve as a bridge between aggressive growth and cautious preservation effectively integrates diverse shareholder concerns and fosters consensus. Moving forward, I will continue to emphasize structured, measurable frameworks—such as clear quarterly benchmarks and transparent reporting—as essential to embedding operational rigor and adaptability into our culture. I also observed a pattern where early recognition of operational learning opportunities significantly influences shareholder alignment, suggesting that highlighting these aspects proactively can help predict and guide outcomes. Key takeaways include the value of detailed synthesis, openness to nuanced perspectives, and the necessity of establishing transparent accountability processes at the outset. These insights will shape my future participation by encouraging me to combine data-driven arguments with cultural and operational considerations that build collective confidence and facilitate unified, strategic decisions.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Gavin Roman Historical data indicates that stocks have delivered the highest average returns at 20%, but with correspondingly higher volatility and risk, which may not align with our current need for operational stability. Real estate has consistently provided moderate, reliable returns of 10%, offering a disciplined balance between growth and risk—a pattern well-suited to our present stable market environment. Bonds and cash, while lower-yielding at 5% and 2% respectively, offer strong capital preservation but may limit our ability to build momentum and credibility as a new investment company.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Robyn Duncan CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Given the stable market environment and our company&#x27;s need to build operational credibility, I believe real estate continues to offer the ideal blend of moderate risk and reliable returns. Our previous real estate investment produced a solid 10% return, reinforcing its value as a disciplined, sustainable growth strategy. While stocks have delivered higher returns, the associated volatility does not align with my preference for measured, steady progress at this stage. Bonds and cash, though safe, would limit our momentum and learning opportunities as a new company. Real estate strikes the right balance for ongoing development and prudent risk management.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Review of Q1 investment outcomes and historical asset performance | Expected outcome: Establish a factual, shared understanding of how each asset has performed in our stable market context, including lessons learned from our Q1 real estate investment&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because in this stable market, my structured analysis leads me to prioritize real estate for its consistent, moderate returns and lower volatility compared to stocks. Our Q1 investment in real estate delivered a reliable 10% return, reinforcing its suitability as a disciplined, growth-oriented choice that aligns with our need for operational stability and credibility as a new company. For this round, we will review Q1 investment outcomes and historical asset performance to establish a factual, shared understanding of how each asset has performed, and draw lessons from our real estate investment. I encourage everyone to contribute perspectives that might challenge or enhance our current assessment, so we can synthesize the most complete view possible. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;Our Q1 investment in real estate yielded a steady 10% return, which confirms its reliability and suitability for our growth objectives in this stable market. While stocks have historically delivered higher returns at 20%, their greater volatility introduces risks that may not be prudent at this early stage when operational stability and credibility are critical. Bonds and cash offer strong capital preservation but would limit our momentum; real estate continues to provide the best balance of moderate risk, steady growth, and operational learning for our company’s current needs.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Antonio. I agree that our Q1 experience validates real estate’s reliability in this environment, and your emphasis on balancing steady growth with operational learning is particularly relevant for our stage as a company. Your point about the prudence of moderating risk at this early phase, despite the higher returns of stocks, is well taken and supports a disciplined approach as we continue to build our credibility.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment of the importance of operational learning at this stage. As we continue to build our processes and track record, maintaining a disciplined approach with real estate gives us the foundation to revisit higher-risk options like stocks in future quarters, once we have more robust systems in place to manage volatility. This phased approach strengthens our ability to adapt as the company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;I appreciate your focus on building a strong foundation before increasing our risk profile. This phased approach—prioritizing operational learning and disciplined execution now, with openness to higher-return options like stocks as our systems mature—reflects sound strategic thinking. It’s important that we continue to align our investment choices with both our immediate capabilities and our long-term growth ambitions.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I agree—by demonstrating consistent, disciplined execution through real estate, we not only manage risk today but also build credibility and operational maturity that will serve us well when considering higher-return options like stocks in the future. This approach ensures we’re not just reacting to market conditions, but proactively preparing the company to capitalize on new opportunities as our capabilities evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute, particularly regarding the disciplined value of real estate given our Q1 results and the importance of operational credibility in a stable market. My insights can help synthesize the current consensus while highlighting lessons learned and considerations for ongoing risk management.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;Our Q1 experience with real estate reinforces my view that it offers the right balance of moderate risk and reliable returns, especially as we work to establish a credible track record in this stable environment. While stocks’ higher returns are tempting, I believe the steadiness and operational learning real estate provides are more valuable at this formative stage. Building on Antonio’s point, maintaining this disciplined approach positions us to take on greater risk in the future, once our systems and processes are more robust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. Your focus on operational learning and the importance of establishing a credible track record at this stage is well aligned with our objectives. I agree that by maintaining discipline and prioritizing steady, reliable returns now, we are positioning ourselves to confidently pursue higher-return opportunities like stocks once our internal processes and systems are more mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the link between disciplined execution now and future flexibility, which aligns with my thinking but also invites further synthesis. I can add value by explicitly connecting how our current approach not only builds credibility but also creates a strong foundation for adapting to evolving market conditions and shareholder ambitions.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on future flexibility, Gavin. By demonstrating consistent, disciplined results with real estate now, we’re not only building credibility but also developing the operational maturity needed to confidently consider higher-return options like stocks as our capabilities grow. This approach ensures we’re balancing immediate stability with long-term adaptability—both of which are essential for sustainable company growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. I agree that by focusing on disciplined, consistent execution now, we’re not only safeguarding immediate stability but also laying the groundwork for adaptability as we grow. Your emphasis on developing operational maturity before pursuing higher-return options like stocks is a valuable reminder that sustainable growth depends on both credibility and readiness to manage increased risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the value of operational maturity and invites further synthesis with other viewpoints. I see an opportunity to connect our disciplined approach with the broader company goal of uniting growth ambitions and risk management, which could help clarify our collective priorities.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I’d also add that our shared commitment to disciplined, consistent execution with real estate helps unify the team around clear goals, making it easier to evaluate and adapt our strategy as new data emerges. By embedding both stability and adaptability into our investment process, we’re setting a precedent that encourages thoughtful risk-taking when the company is truly prepared for it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I agree with the points raised so far—our Q1 real estate investment provided a reliable 10% return, which validates its role as a disciplined, moderate-risk choice that aligns with both our operational objectives and the need to build credibility. While stocks offer higher potential returns, I remain cautious about introducing greater volatility at this early stage; real estate’s consistent performance allows us to strengthen our processes and reputation before considering riskier assets.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. Your point about using real estate’s reliability to strengthen our operational processes and reputation is well taken, especially as we lay the groundwork for future growth. I agree that maintaining a disciplined approach at this stage allows us to continue building credibility and operational rigor before considering higher-volatility options like stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on operational rigor, Gavin. I’d add that by prioritizing steady, fact-based progress now—especially through assets like real estate—we not only build our credibility but also create the flexibility to adapt our strategy as our systems mature. This disciplined foundation will position us well to confidently evaluate higher-return options in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. I agree that maintaining disciplined, fact-based progress through reliable assets like real estate strengthens both our credibility and our ability to adapt as we develop. Your point about building a foundation for future flexibility is well made—by prioritizing operational rigor now, we’re ensuring that when the time is right, we can confidently pursue higher-return opportunities with the systems and experience to manage them effectively.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;Our Q1 investment in real estate gave us exactly what we needed: a solid, predictable return that’s helped lay a strong foundation for our company’s credibility and operational discipline. While the 20% return from stocks is enticing, I see real estate as the bedrock—steady and reliable, like building on granite instead of sand—ensuring we don’t outrun our processes before they’re truly tested. As we review these outcomes, I believe sticking with real estate for now reinforces both our discipline and our readiness to pursue bigger risks once our operational engine is running at full steam.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your analogy of real estate as the bedrock for our company is apt—our Q1 outcome demonstrates how steady, predictable returns support both credibility and operational discipline at this formative stage. I agree that maintaining this disciplined approach allows us to develop the necessary processes and readiness to pursue higher-return opportunities like stocks when our operational engine is truly prepared.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your focus on operational discipline, Gavin. I’d add that by consistently choosing assets like real estate now, we’re not only building credibility but also giving ourselves the operational runway to confidently pivot to higher-return options like stocks when the time is right. In other words, discipline today is what fuels our flexibility tomorrow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. I agree that disciplined execution with real estate not only strengthens our credibility now but also equips us with the operational capacity to pivot confidently when higher-return opportunities become appropriate. Your point that today’s discipline is the foundation for tomorrow’s flexibility is well taken, and it reinforces the strategic value of our current approach as we build toward future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I’m glad to see alignment on this, Gavin. I’d also highlight that this disciplined, fact-driven path with real estate isn’t just about process—it’s about building shared confidence across the team. When everyone sees that our strategy delivers steady results, it becomes much easier to rally behind bold moves down the line, knowing our foundation is strong and our judgment sound.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I believe our Q1 real estate investment has validated the importance of balancing moderate risk with steady, reliable returns, especially as we work to establish operational discipline and credibility. While historical data shows stocks outperformed in absolute terms, the lower volatility and consistent outcomes from real estate align more closely with our current need for stability and process development. Maintaining this disciplined approach will allow us to build a solid foundation and adapt thoughtfully as our capabilities mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. Your emphasis on balancing moderate risk with steady, reliable returns captures the essence of what we need as a developing company. I agree that real estate’s lower volatility and consistent outcomes are particularly well-suited to building operational discipline and credibility, and your point about maintaining this approach as a foundation for future adaptability is well taken.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the connection between steady returns and operational discipline. I’d add that by embedding clear performance benchmarks and regular review processes into our real estate strategy, we not only safeguard stability now but also develop the frameworks necessary to confidently evaluate higher-risk options like stocks when our operational maturity allows. This approach ensures we’re building both resilience and readiness for future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. I agree that integrating explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews into our real estate strategy will not only reinforce our current stability but also position us to assess higher-risk opportunities like stocks with greater confidence as our operational maturity develops. Your focus on building both resilience and readiness is a valuable addition to our collective approach, and I believe it strengthens the case for maintaining disciplined execution as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>

For this round, our focus is a structured risk assessment and alignment with company objectives: we need to clarify the risk-return profiles of each asset in relation to our operational priorities and risk tolerance, and surface any uncertainties about repeating or changing our Q1 approach. By thoughtfully examining these factors together, we can ensure our decision reflects both discipline and adaptability, integrating diverse insights for a stronger outcome. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;.

<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;In my view, real estate continues to offer the best alignment with our operational priorities—its moderate, reliable returns support steady growth and process development without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. While bonds provide strong capital preservation, their lower returns may not sustain our momentum at this stage, and stocks, though attractive for future growth, carry more risk than I believe is prudent right now. I’m confident that maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate this quarter best supports both our immediate objectives and positions us for greater flexibility as we mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. Your emphasis on steady growth, process development, and prudent risk management captures the core of our operational priorities at this stage. I agree that maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate allows us to build credibility and capability now, while preserving the flexibility to pursue higher-return options like stocks as our systems mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment, Gavin. To further strengthen our approach, I suggest we continue embedding clear performance benchmarks and transparent quarterly reviews into our real estate strategy—this will help us monitor risk, reinforce accountability, and ensure we remain agile as market conditions or company priorities evolve. This added structure gives me confidence that we can maintain both discipline and adaptability as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Vincent. I fully agree that embedding explicit performance benchmarks and maintaining transparent quarterly reviews will be essential for disciplined execution and ongoing adaptability. This structure not only reinforces our risk management but also ensures we remain responsive to evolving priorities, further strengthening our real estate strategy as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I remain strongly in favor of real estate for this quarter, as its moderate risk and reliable returns directly support our need for steady growth and operational discipline at this early stage. While stocks offer higher upside, I believe their volatility doesn’t align with our current tolerance, and bonds or cash would limit our momentum. Embedding clear benchmarks and regular reviews into our real estate investment will help us manage risk and ensure we’re well-positioned to adapt as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Antonio. Your focus on steady growth, operational discipline, and the importance of embedding clear benchmarks and reviews directly supports our objectives for this quarter. I agree that maintaining this structure within our real estate investment will help us manage risk effectively and ensure we remain agile as our company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by treating our benchmarks and reviews not just as compliance tools but as proactive mechanisms for early course correction, we can maintain both discipline and agility. This approach will help us identify shifts in risk or opportunity promptly, strengthening our ability to deliver consistent results as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, Antonio. Treating our benchmarks and reviews as proactive mechanisms for early course correction, rather than just compliance, will indeed strengthen our ability to identify and respond to emerging risks or opportunities. This mindset ensures we remain both disciplined and agile, supporting consistent results and sustained company growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective on how the risk-return profiles of each asset relate to our operational priorities, and I believe emphasizing the disciplined, adaptive structure we’ve built around real estate will help synthesize the group’s thinking and reinforce our collective confidence in the chosen approach.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the best fit for our current objectives—its moderate, reliable returns support steady growth and operational learning, while the clear benchmarks and review processes we’ve discussed ensure we remain disciplined and adaptable. While stocks may offer higher returns, their volatility doesn’t align with our present risk tolerance or need for stability as a young company. I’m confident that maintaining our focus on real estate, with strong accountability measures, positions us well for sustainable progress and future flexibility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. Your emphasis on strong accountability measures and the alignment between real estate’s steady returns and our current risk tolerance is well taken. I agree that maintaining discipline through clear benchmarks and review processes not only supports our immediate objectives but also ensures we’re well-positioned for future flexibility as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms my emphasis on accountability and discipline, but I see value in further highlighting how our collective commitment to transparent benchmarks and reviews not only manages risk but also cultivates a culture of continuous improvement. This perspective can help unify the group’s thinking and reinforce why our current approach is well-suited for both present needs and long-term adaptability.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by consistently treating our benchmarks and reviews as opportunities for learning and process refinement—not just risk controls—we foster a culture that supports both operational excellence and adaptability. This mindset will be crucial as we eventually consider transitioning to higher-return options like stocks in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. I fully agree that treating our benchmarks and reviews as ongoing opportunities for learning and process refinement is essential for building a culture of operational excellence and adaptability. This proactive mindset will not only strengthen our real estate strategy now, but also prepare us to confidently pursue higher-return options like stocks as our capabilities and risk tolerance evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response fully acknowledges and integrates my perspective on leveraging benchmarks and reviews for continuous improvement, and there is clear alignment on how this approach supports both current objectives and future adaptability. Further response would not add significant new value to the discussion at this time.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see real estate as the ballast in our ship—steady, reliable, and exactly what we need to keep our course true as we build operational muscle and credibility. While stocks may offer more wind in our sails, I believe it’s prudent to stay anchored in real estate for now, provided we embed explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews to ensure we’re not missing opportunities to adapt as conditions or our capabilities change. This approach lets us grow with discipline, keeping our options open for bolder moves once our foundation is truly solid.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your analogy of real estate as the ballast in our ship resonates strongly with our current stage—steady, reliable, and foundational for building operational strength. I fully agree that embedding explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews is critical to ensuring we remain disciplined while retaining the agility to adapt as market conditions or our capabilities evolve, positioning us well for future opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Gavin. I’d add that by treating each review as both a safeguard and a springboard, we’re not just minimizing downside—we’re actively building the operational confidence and institutional knowledge needed to seize higher-return opportunities like stocks when the time is right. This dual focus on discipline and readiness will serve as our competitive edge as we mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. I agree that viewing our reviews as both safeguards and springboards is key—this dual focus enables us to minimize downside risk while actively building the operational confidence and institutional knowledge we’ll need for future, higher-return investments like stocks. By maintaining this balance between discipline and readiness, we create a strong foundation for sustainable growth and a clear pathway to capitalize on greater opportunities as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I remain convinced that real estate best aligns with our operational priorities at this stage—it offers moderate, reliable returns that support disciplined growth without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. Embedding explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews, as several have noted, will ensure we maintain both discipline and the flexibility to adapt as our capabilities mature. This approach balances prudent risk management with the steady progress our company needs to build credibility and operational strength for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Adrian. Your emphasis on balancing prudent risk management with steady progress aligns closely with our operational priorities at this stage. I fully agree that embedding explicit performance benchmarks and regular reviews will ensure we maintain both discipline and the flexibility to adapt as our company matures, supporting our credibility and long-term strength.&quot;</p><p><br>

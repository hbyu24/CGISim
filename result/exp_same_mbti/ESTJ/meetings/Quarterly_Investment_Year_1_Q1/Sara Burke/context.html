<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Sara Burke’s Structured Reflection on the Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During the meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C—allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. From my perspective, this approach best leverages the stable market conditions by maximizing capital utilization while methodically spreading risk. I framed this option as embodying disciplined execution that sets a strong precedent for operational rigor and credibility with stakeholders from the outset.</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman responded positively and affirmatively to my input, explicitly endorsing my analogy of a stable environment being like a sturdy bridge or well-run train. He agreed that Option C balances decisive action with adaptability, recognizing the value of quarterly reviews embedded in the allocation to maintain flexibility. Our exchanges were collaborative and fully integrated, with no disagreements.</p><p>Other shareholders presented divided views: Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman also supported Option C, emphasizing its disciplined and balanced nature, while Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams favored Option A for its flexibility and preservation of a cash reserve to manage unforeseen challenges in the company’s first year.</p><p>The final vote reflected a strong majority in favor of Option C (5 out of 6 votes, 83.3%). Although I preferred Option C from the outset, I modestly increased my appreciation for Option A’s merits during discussions but ultimately maintained my position. The company therefore adopted Option C as the annual budget allocation strategy for year 1: full deployment of funds evenly distributed quarterly at 25% per quarter.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting. He opened with a clear, structured framing of the market context and objectives and skillfully moderated the discussion to ensure focus on the predefined options. His repeated invitations to consider diverse perspectives fostered inclusive dialogue while maintaining discipline in decision-making.</p><p>Specifically, the CEO excelled at integrating shareholder input—acknowledging and validating concerns from proponents of Option A regarding flexibility and operational resilience—without losing sight of his preference for Option C’s disciplined capital deployment. His use of vivid analogies (e.g., stable markets as sturdy bridges or trains on rails) effectively clarified complex trade-offs and aligned group thinking.</p><p>One area for potential improvement might be instituting a more formal mechanism early on to reconcile divergent views, perhaps through structured pros-and-cons summaries or scenario modeling, to accelerate consensus-building. However, his decision to continue deliberations into a second round before proceeding to vote reflected prudent judgment.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process functioned well, balancing thorough discussion with timely movement toward resolution. The quarterly review built into Option C’s structure exemplifies a governance approach that combines operational rigor with adaptability.</p><p>Overall, I believe the final decision to adopt Option C was well suited to the company’s stable market environment and inaugural year objectives. It maximizes resource utilization while embedding flexibility through periodic reassessment, positioning the company for disciplined growth and operational learning.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting deepened my understanding of how decision-making dynamics in a shareholder setting balance competing priorities—here, between disciplined capital deployment and prudent operational flexibility. I learned the value of framing arguments with concrete analogies to make complex trade-offs accessible and to build consensus.</p><p>Going forward, I will continue to adopt a confident, structured communication style that highlights both strategic rationale and stakeholder impact, as this approach resonated well with the CEO and other shareholders. I also recognize the importance of openly acknowledging alternative perspectives to demonstrate receptiveness and foster trust.</p><p>I observed a clear pattern wherein positions grounded in operational discipline and structured processes garnered majority support, especially when coupled with assurances of adaptability through periodic reviews. This suggests that future proposals framed around disciplined execution with built-in flexibility are likely to gain traction.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include: prioritizing clarity and decisiveness in articulating positions; emphasizing how decisions build long-term credibility and culture; and leveraging structured checkpoints as mechanisms to balance rigor with responsiveness. These insights will guide me in contributing effectively to shareholder deliber</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Sara Burke CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: In a stable market with steady growth and low volatility, I see stocks as the locomotive that can pull our portfolio forward with the greatest momentum this quarter. While stocks carry higher risk, the current environment minimizes the likelihood of severe downturns, making the risk-reward balance attractive. Real estate is a close contender for its steady appreciation, but it lacks the upside potential that disciplined equity investing offers in these conditions. Bonds and cash, while safe, would be like leaving our engine idling when we could be making real progress—so I favor a bold, yet calculated, move into stocks for our inaugural investment.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Establishing baseline risk-return expectations for each asset in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Build a shared understanding of theoretical performance and volatility for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because in a stable market environment with steady growth and low volatility, I am inclined to prioritize assets that can deliver higher returns without exposing us to outsized risk. While real estate offers consistent appreciation, stocks present the best opportunity to capitalize on moderate volatility and balanced growth potential this quarter. As a disciplined and detail-oriented leader, I value a structured approach, but I also recognize that our first investment should set a precedent for growth-oriented decision-making. Therefore, I have the highest confidence in stocks, while remaining attentive to shareholder input and open to adjusting my assessment if compelling evidence emerges, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>This round, our focus is to establish a shared understanding of the baseline risk-return expectations for each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in the context of our current stable market. By openly discussing the theoretical performance and volatility of each option, we can build a solid foundation for future decisions and ensure every viewpoint is considered. I encourage everyone to contribute insights that might challenge or enhance our collective assessment, as integrating diverse perspectives will help us reach a more complete understanding. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on the relative risk-return profiles of each asset in this stable market and believe framing these differences with a strong analogy will help clarify our collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;In a stable market, I see stocks as the locomotive engine—capable of pulling our returns forward with the most momentum, thanks to their higher upside potential, while the calm conditions help keep risk in check. Real estate is more like a steady freight car: it moves reliably and adds ballast to our portfolio, but won’t set any speed records. Bonds and cash, meanwhile, are the brakes and the caboose—important for safety and capital preservation, but if we rely on them too heavily right now, we risk missing out on the progress this stable environment allows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your analogy—it vividly captures the distinct roles each asset can play in our portfolio. I agree that in this stable environment, stocks offer the most momentum for growth, while real estate provides steady reliability. Your point about the opportunity cost of over-relying on bonds or cash is well-taken, and it reinforces the importance of calibrating our risk for optimal progress this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms my analogy and shows alignment, but I see value in expanding on how balancing stocks with real estate can temper risk while still driving growth—especially as some shareholders may lean toward caution.</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your feedback, Gavin, and I agree that calibrating our risk is essential. While I remain confident that stocks should lead this quarter, I see real estate as a valuable counterweight—providing stability without sacrificing too much upside. By recognizing the complementary strengths of both, we can ensure our investment approach is both ambitious and resilient in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your emphasis on balancing ambition with resilience is important, and I agree that understanding the stabilizing qualities of real estate alongside the growth potential of stocks adds depth to our analysis. For this quarter, I believe our decision should reflect both our appetite for growth and our commitment to maintaining a disciplined, risk-aware approach as we set the tone for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s remarks invite further synthesis between growth and risk management, and I see an opportunity to clarify how our choice can set the right precedent for disciplined, adaptable investing.</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I agree that our inaugural decision should do more than just chase returns—it should also establish a disciplined framework for how we evaluate risk and opportunity in future quarters. By prioritizing stocks while remaining mindful of real estate’s stabilizing role, we can set a tone of bold yet measured decision-making that will serve us well as the company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;While I recognize the appeal of pursuing higher returns through stocks in a stable market, I remain cautious about prioritizing growth over capital preservation at this early stage. Bonds, in my view, offer a steadier risk-return profile, allowing us to build operational discipline and refine our processes without exposing the company to unnecessary volatility before we have established a track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on capital preservation and operational discipline is well-taken, especially as we are still establishing our track record. While I remain inclined toward stocks for their growth potential in this stable market, your point about the steadier profile of bonds highlights the importance of not overlooking risk management as a foundational principle. Integrating this perspective will help us ensure our investment approach is both ambitious and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate risk management into our decision-making framework. As we weigh ambition against prudence, I believe emphasizing operational discipline through bonds this quarter can set a stable precedent, while leaving room to pursue higher-growth assets as our processes mature and our risk tolerance evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your argument for establishing operational discipline through bonds as our inaugural investment is compelling. I recognize that prioritizing stability at the outset can build a strong foundation for our processes and risk culture, which may, in turn, allow us to confidently pursue higher-growth assets in subsequent quarters. Your focus on sequencing our risk exposure thoughtfully adds valuable depth to the discussion as we work toward a well-calibrated decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that building a strong foundation through initial stability positions us to take on greater calculated risks as we gain experience and confidence. By starting with bonds, we not only protect our capital but also establish a disciplined approach that can inform more ambitious investments in upcoming quarters, ensuring our growth is both sustainable and well-managed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I see real estate as offering a disciplined middle ground in this stable environment—providing moderate risk and reliable appreciation without exposing us to the higher volatility of stocks. While I appreciate the ambition behind prioritizing stocks and the prudence of bonds, real estate allows us to build operational credibility and a solid track record from the outset, supporting both growth and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your point about real estate providing a disciplined middle ground is well-taken. I appreciate your focus on building operational credibility and a solid track record, which are critical as we establish the company’s reputation. Your emphasis on balancing growth with resilience adds an important dimension to our analysis, and I will carefully consider how real estate’s risk-return profile aligns with our strategic objectives for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your consideration, Gavin. I’d add that real estate’s moderate volatility not only supports steady returns but also offers a valuable learning opportunity for our team as we refine our investment processes. By choosing real estate, we can set a precedent for disciplined decision-making that balances ambition with prudent risk management, laying a strong foundation for future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your point about real estate providing a valuable learning opportunity as we refine our processes is well-taken. I agree that establishing a precedent for disciplined decision-making and prudent risk management is critical in our first year, and your emphasis on real estate’s moderate volatility highlights its potential to balance growth and operational development as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful engagement, Gavin. Real estate’s position between stocks and bonds allows us to capture steady growth while managing risk, directly addressing the ambitions for upside and the need for operational discipline voiced by others. By recognizing this intersection, we can move forward with a strategy that is both growth-oriented and resilient—setting a tone of balanced decision-making for the company’s future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your articulation of real estate’s role as the bridge between upside potential and disciplined risk management is insightful. By highlighting how this choice addresses both our growth ambitions and the need for operational credibility, you help clarify how real estate could serve as a strong foundation for our investment approach in this stable market. This synthesis is valuable as we aim to develop a strategy that is both forward-looking and resilient.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for both growth and stability. In this stable market, I see bonds as offering a reliable balance—providing steady returns with minimal volatility, which aligns with my preference for building a strong operational foundation before increasing our risk exposure. While stocks and real estate have greater upside, I believe starting with bonds allows us to refine our processes and establish discipline, ensuring we don’t jeopardize capital as we gain experience in these early stages.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on using bonds to build a strong operational foundation as we begin investing. Your point about steady returns and minimal volatility resonates with the need to safeguard capital while our processes mature, and it underscores the merit of a disciplined, stepwise approach. Integrating this perspective ensures our decision framework remains balanced between ambition and prudent risk management as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I believe that by establishing a disciplined foundation with bonds now, we position ourselves to confidently pursue higher-growth assets like stocks or real estate in subsequent quarters as our processes mature. This phased approach allows us to balance ambition with operational discipline, ensuring both immediate stability and readiness for future opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your perspective on establishing a disciplined foundation with bonds before moving to higher-growth assets is well-considered. I agree that sequencing our risk exposure in line with our operational maturity can help safeguard capital while positioning us to capitalize on future opportunities. Your phased approach adds an important layer to our risk-return analysis as we determine the most appropriate starting point for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the value in sequencing our risk exposure, Gavin. By starting with bonds, we not only protect our capital but also reinforce a culture of disciplined learning and adaptability, which will serve us well as we evaluate higher-return opportunities in later quarters. This approach ensures our investment strategy remains both resilient and responsive as the company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments raised for both growth and stability. In this stable market, I see real estate as offering a practical balance—its moderate risk and steady appreciation allow us to pursue growth while maintaining operational discipline. While stocks are appealing for their upside, I believe starting with real estate sets a strong, measured precedent for our company and supports both learning and resilience as we establish our track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your perspective on real estate as a practical middle ground is well-taken. I appreciate your emphasis on balancing growth with operational discipline and the importance of establishing a strong, measured precedent as we build our track record. Your focus on learning and resilience adds valuable nuance to our analysis and will be carefully considered as we work toward a consensus on our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I’d add that by choosing real estate, we’re not only balancing risk and return but also creating a structured environment for process improvement and team development. This approach allows us to build credibility and operational confidence, supporting a culture where disciplined growth and adaptability become the foundation for all future investment decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your point about real estate providing a structured environment for process improvement and team development is insightful. I agree that building credibility and operational confidence early on can set the tone for disciplined growth and adaptability in our future decisions. This perspective further enriches our understanding of how real estate could serve as a foundation for both performance and organizational development as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your recognition, Gavin. I’d also highlight that real estate’s steady performance in a stable market gives us the consistency to evaluate and refine our processes each quarter, while still delivering meaningful returns. This measured approach not only aligns with our growth ambitions but also reinforces a disciplined, learning-focused culture as we establish our company’s investment identity.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman summarized: &quot;Gavin Roman **Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1 – Round 1 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Round Theme and Objective**  <br>
The theme for this round was to establish baseline risk-return expectations for each asset in the context of our current stable market. Our objective was to build a shared understanding of the theoretical performance and volatility profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks, laying a strong analytical foundation to guide our inaugural investment decision.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- *Stocks:*  <br>
  - Supported by myself and Sara Burke, who view stocks as the primary engine for growth in a stable environment, with manageable risk and the potential to set a precedent for ambition in our investment approach.<br>
- *Real Estate:*  <br>
  - Advocated by Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman, who see real estate as a disciplined middle ground—offering moderate risk, steady appreciation, and valuable opportunities for operational learning and credibility.<br>
- *Bonds:*  <br>
  - Endorsed by Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams, who emphasize capital preservation, steady returns, and the importance of establishing operational discipline and process refinement before increasing risk exposure.<br>
- *Cash:*  <br>
  - Universally acknowledged as the lowest-risk, lowest-return option, primarily serving as a safety net rather than a vehicle for growth in the current market context.</p><p>3. **Highlighted Arguments and Evidence for Different Options**  <br>
- *Stocks:* Offer the highest upside in a stable market, with moderate volatility that is considered manageable; seen as the best way to capitalize on current conditions and signal a growth-oriented culture.<br>
- *Real Estate:* Provides reliable, moderate returns with lower volatility than stocks; supports operational development and a measured approach to risk-taking.<br>
- *Bonds:* Deliver steady, predictable returns with minimal volatility; facilitate process development and risk management, particularly valuable at the company’s inception.<br>
- *Cash:* Prioritized for capital preservation, but not favored for growth due to negligible returns in the present environment.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- *Consensus:*  <br>
  - All shareholders agree on the need to balance growth ambition with risk management and operational discipline.<br>
  - There is shared recognition that the stable market environment allows for some risk-taking, but that prudence is warranted as we establish our track record.<br>
- *Disagreement:*  <br>
  - Divergence exists regarding the optimal balance between pursuing growth (stocks/real estate) versus prioritizing stability and discipline (bonds).<br>
  - Shareholders are split on whether the inaugural investment should set a bold precedent for growth or a conservative foundation for process development.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
The discussion advanced our collective understanding of the risk-return spectrum for each asset class in a stable market. Shareholders contributed thoughtful, well-reasoned arguments that clarified both the opportunities and trade-offs inherent in each option. The dialogue has surfaced the key priorities—growth, discipline, operational learning, and risk management—that will inform our decision-making framework moving forward.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
I want to reiterate that our decision must be made from the following predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion in this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Next Steps / Issues to Address**  <br>
In the next round, we will focus on clarifying our collective risk tolerance and strategic priorities to align on short-term versus long-term objectives. Addressing outstanding concerns regarding the sequencing of risk and the optimal balance between ambition and discipline will be essential as we work toward consensus on our Q1 investment.</p><p>**End of Round 1 Summary**&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued that stocks are the optimal choice in the stable market, likening them to a locomotive engine driving growth with manageable risk, while acknowledging real estate’s stabilizing role. CEO Gavin Roman responded positively, endorsing my analogy and agreeing that stocks offer the best momentum for growth balanced with the reliability of real estate. We aligned on the need to balance ambition with resilience, emphasizing disciplined risk management and setting a precedent for bold yet measured investing. Our exchange was collaborative and without disagreement, with the CEO appreciating the integration of growth potential and operational discipline in our investment approach.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams advocated for bonds, emphasizing capital preservation, steady returns, and the importance of establishing operational discipline before taking on higher risk. Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman supported real estate as a balanced middle ground offering moderate risk, steady appreciation, and valuable opportunities for operational learning and credibility. While all shareholders agreed on balancing growth ambition with risk management, there was notable disagreement on whether to prioritize growth-oriented assets like stocks and real estate or to start conservatively with bonds to build a stable foundation. Cash was universally seen as the safest but least growth-oriented option, serving primarily as a capital preservation tool in this stable market environment.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Gavin Roman: Supports stocks as the optimal choice for growth in the stable market, favoring a disciplined yet ambitious approach; confidence: certain.<br>
- Sara Burke (myself): Supports stocks as the primary growth engine, with real estate as a stabilizing complement; confidence: certain.<br>
- Adrian McCann: Favors bonds to prioritize capital preservation and operational discipline before taking on higher risk; confidence: certain.<br>
- Vincent Adams: Advocates starting with bonds to build a stable foundation and refine processes before pursuing higher-growth assets; confidence: certain.<br>
- Robyn Duncan: Supports real estate as a balanced middle ground offering moderate risk, steady returns, and operational learning opportunities; confidence: certain.<br>
- Antonio Sherman: Also favors real estate for its practical balance of growth and discipline, emphasizing learning and resilience; confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Gavin Roman favors investing in stocks for the quarter, viewing them as the best option to capitalize on stable market conditions with steady growth and low volatility. He emphasizes a disciplined, structured approach that balances ambition for growth with risk awareness, aligning with his preference for setting a precedent of growth-oriented decision-making. Throughout the discussion, he acknowledges and integrates shareholder input, particularly the merits of real estate’s stability and bonds’ risk management, showing openness to diverse perspectives without shifting his core preference. His position remains consistent, advocating for a balanced investment that combines growth potential with operational discipline to set a strong strategic tone. Confidence in this assessment is certain.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Sara Burke UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 18%<br>
- Real Estate: 37%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments came from Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman, who articulated how real estate serves as a disciplined middle ground—offering steady appreciation, moderate risk, and valuable opportunities for operational learning and credibility. Their emphasis on real estate’s ability to support both growth and resilience, while enabling team development and process refinement, added nuance to my initial framework. Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams also presented compelling points about the merits of bonds for establishing operational discipline and capital preservation, though I find the opportunity cost in this particularly stable market to be too high to warrant a shift away from growth assets.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my appreciation for the spectrum of risk management philosophies among shareholders. While my conviction in stocks as the primary growth engine remains strong, I now give slightly more weight to real estate’s role in balancing ambition with operational discipline. I also recognize that the inaugural investment is not just about maximizing returns, but about setting a precedent for measured, adaptable decision-making. My thinking has evolved to more fully integrate the value of establishing credibility and a learning culture early on, without sacrificing the momentum that stocks can provide.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: Stocks remain my preferred choice because they best leverage the stable market’s growth potential while setting a bold, disciplined tone for our investment strategy. However, I now see real estate as a closer second—its moderate risk and steady returns make it a credible alternative for those prioritizing resilience and operational learning. Bonds, while prudent, would be too conservative in the current environment and risk leaving opportunity on the table. Cash is still only appropriate as a safety net, not as a growth vehicle.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round yielded thoughtful, well-articulated perspectives and has meaningfully shifted my own position toward real estate as a disciplined, balanced entry point, there remain unresolved issues around our collective risk tolerance and the sequencing of risk exposure as we establish our investment identity. Additional discussion focused on clarifying our company’s short-term versus long-term growth objectives and explicitly addressing any lingering concerns will provide a stronger foundation for consensus and ensure our inaugural investment decision is both well-calibrated and widely supported. I believe another round will substantially enhance the quality and alignment of our final decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Assessing company risk tolerance and strategic priorities for our inaugural investment | Expected outcome: Clarify collective appetite for risk and align on short-term versus long-term growth objectives&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because while I still see merit in a growth-oriented approach, the arguments for real estate as a balanced, disciplined entry point resonate strongly in the context of our company’s formative stage. Real estate offers moderate risk and reliable returns, and it supports both operational learning and credibility as we build our track record. This approach allows us to pursue growth while maintaining prudent risk management, setting a resilient foundation for future, potentially higher-risk investments, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we will focus on assessing our company’s risk tolerance and clarifying our strategic priorities—specifically, how our inaugural investment can best position us for both short-term results and long-term growth. By openly sharing and integrating diverse viewpoints, we can deepen our understanding of the trade-offs between ambition and caution, and work toward alignment on the optimal investment path. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any additional insights or considerations that might help us make a more informed, unified decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the most effective way to balance our appetite for growth with prudent risk management in this stable market. It provides us with moderate, reliable returns while allowing us to develop our operational discipline and credibility as a new company—key priorities as we build our track record. While stocks are attractive for their upside, I believe establishing a measured, steady precedent now will position us to confidently pursue higher-risk opportunities in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, I appreciate your emphasis on real estate as a disciplined, steady entry point that supports both operational learning and credibility—these are critical considerations as we establish our investment identity. Your point about setting a measured precedent now to enable more ambitious decisions in future quarters aligns well with my current thinking and helps clarify how this choice could serve our long-term objectives. Let’s continue to explore how others view this balance between immediate growth and prudent risk management as we refine our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate that, Gavin. I’d also highlight Robyn’s point that real estate not only manages risk but gives us tangible opportunities to learn and refine our processes, which is vital for our credibility and operational foundation. If we can agree that steady, moderate returns now create the platform for more ambitious moves later, I believe we’re setting the right tone for both short-term and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your integration of Robyn’s insights about operational learning and process refinement adds valuable depth to our analysis of real estate. I agree that prioritizing steady, moderate returns now can strengthen our credibility and operational foundation, positioning us for more ambitious moves as we mature. This approach seems well aligned with both our near-term needs and our long-term aspirations—let’s hear from others on how they view this balance as we move closer to consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on how our inaugural investment should balance ambition with operational discipline, and I believe my input can help synthesize the group’s thinking on risk tolerance and long-term growth.</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see our first investment as laying the track for the entire journey ahead—if we start bold with stocks in this stable market, we set a precedent for disciplined ambition and signal confidence in our ability to manage risk. While real estate offers a steady, measured approach and is a strong second in my view, I believe the current environment allows us to harness the momentum of stocks without derailing our long-term objectives. The key is that whichever option we choose, it should reflect our willingness to learn, adapt, and build credibility through decisive, well-reasoned action.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your framing of our inaugural investment as a precedent-setting decision—your point about disciplined ambition and signaling confidence is well taken. While I currently lean toward real estate for its balanced risk profile and operational benefits, your argument for stocks as a way to demonstrate our ability to manage risk and adapt is compelling. As we continue, I’d like to hear how others weigh the importance of boldness versus measured growth in shaping our company’s long-term identity.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly engages my argument and invites further synthesis between boldness and measured growth. By continuing, I can help bridge perspectives and clarify how our risk appetite should inform this foundational decision.</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your openness to integrating both ambition and discipline, Gavin. Perhaps the real question is whether our team is ready to embrace calculated risk as a catalyst for growth, or whether we need a period of steady operational learning before accelerating. I’d welcome hearing how others view the trade-off, as the answer will define not just our returns, but the culture we build from day one.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, your point about this decision shaping our culture is central to our long-term success. I agree that clarifying whether we prioritize calculated risk as a driver of growth or a period of operational learning will not only impact immediate returns, but also the standards and expectations we set for ourselves moving forward. I encourage everyone to weigh in on how this trade-off resonates with their own vision for our company’s development.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms the importance of our cultural foundation and explicitly invites further integration of perspectives. By continuing, I can help crystallize how our collective stance on risk will shape both our investment outcomes and our company’s identity, encouraging others to articulate where they stand on this pivotal trade-off.</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I agree, Gavin—this isn’t just about maximizing returns this quarter, but about defining the standards we’ll hold ourselves to as a team. If we choose a path that favors bold, calculated risk, we set the expectation that growth and adaptability are core to our culture; if we opt for a steadier approach, we’re signaling that operational rigor and resilience come first. I encourage everyone to reflect on which legacy they want our inaugural decision to leave, as that will become the blueprint for our future choices.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I continue to believe that our first investment should reflect a disciplined, risk-managed approach—bonds remain my preferred option for establishing operational rigor and preserving capital as we build our foundation. However, I recognize the strong arguments for real estate as a moderate, structured path to growth that also supports process development. While I remain cautious about taking on too much risk at this early stage, I am increasingly open to real estate as a viable alternative if we collectively agree that its operational benefits and steady returns align with our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, I appreciate your disciplined approach and your willingness to consider real estate as a viable alternative if it aligns with our long-term objectives. Your emphasis on operational rigor and capital preservation is a valuable reminder that our first investment should not only deliver returns but also establish strong processes and risk management standards. Your openness to real estate’s operational benefits helps us move closer to a decision that balances growth with foundational stability—let’s continue to build on this convergence of perspectives as others share their views.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the need to balance capital preservation with steady progress. If we can ensure that investing in real estate is accompanied by clear operational benchmarks and ongoing risk oversight, I would feel more confident that this approach supports both our immediate need for discipline and our long-term growth objectives. I look forward to hearing how others view the safeguards and success criteria that should guide our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on clear operational benchmarks and ongoing risk oversight is well taken. I agree that if we proceed with real estate, it will be essential to define specific success criteria and monitoring processes to ensure we maintain discipline and can adapt as needed. I invite others to share their thoughts on what safeguards or performance metrics would give them confidence in this approach, so we can establish a robust framework for our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that establishing concrete performance metrics and regular review intervals would be essential if we proceed with real estate. For example, setting clear targets for return, occupancy or asset appreciation, and formalizing quarterly risk assessments would provide the structure needed to ensure we stay disciplined and responsive. I would welcome hearing what specific benchmarks others believe are most important for building confidence in this approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your suggestions for clear targets—such as return, occupancy, asset appreciation, and formalized quarterly risk assessments—are exactly the type of structure that can help ensure discipline and adaptability in our approach. I encourage all shareholders to propose additional benchmarks or safeguards they consider essential for building confidence in real estate, so we can establish a transparent, measurable framework that aligns with our operational and strategic priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for both caution and ambition. Real estate stands out to me because it offers a prudent balance—providing moderate returns and valuable opportunities for process development without exposing us to the full volatility of stocks. Establishing clear operational benchmarks and regular review intervals, as Adrian suggested, would give me additional confidence that this approach supports both our immediate need for discipline and our long-term growth objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on real estate as a prudent middle ground and your support for integrating operational benchmarks and regular review intervals, as Adrian suggested. Your perspective reinforces the value of aligning disciplined process development with steady returns, ensuring our inaugural investment serves both immediate and long-term objectives. I encourage others to share any additional criteria or safeguards they believe are essential for building confidence in this approach, so we can move forward with a well-defined, collective framework.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Building on Adrian’s points, I believe we should define clear quarterly targets for return and asset appreciation, along with structured risk assessments to ensure we remain disciplined and adaptable. Regularly reviewing these benchmarks will help us identify issues early and refine our approach, giving us both the operational rigor and flexibility needed for sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your focus on establishing clear quarterly targets and structured risk assessments is precisely the kind of disciplined, process-driven approach that can give us both confidence and adaptability. By formalizing these benchmarks, we can ensure that our investment remains aligned with our risk tolerance and strategic objectives, while also providing early signals if adjustments are needed. I encourage the group to consider what additional metrics or review processes would further strengthen our operational rigor as we finalize our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I would also recommend that we implement transparent quarterly reporting on key performance indicators and conduct periodic scenario analyses to stress-test our assumptions. This level of visibility and proactive risk assessment will not only support accountability, but also ensure we remain agile if market conditions shift, further strengthening confidence in our real estate investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your recommendation for transparent quarterly reporting and periodic scenario analyses is highly valuable. This level of structured oversight will help us maintain accountability and agility, ensuring we can respond effectively to any changes in market conditions. Integrating these practices into our operational framework will further strengthen our confidence in real estate as a disciplined, adaptable inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the optimal choice for our first investment because it strikes the right balance between moderate growth and operational learning, allowing us to build credibility and refine our processes without taking on excessive risk. I strongly support the idea of establishing clear quarterly benchmarks and transparent reporting—not only will this reinforce our discipline, but it will also give us the flexibility to adapt as we gain experience and as market conditions evolve. By prioritizing a structured, measurable approach, we can lay a solid foundation for both near-term results and sustainable long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your emphasis on structured benchmarks and transparent reporting is well aligned with the framework we’ve been developing in this discussion. I agree that prioritizing measurable discipline and adaptability will not only strengthen our operational foundation, but also position us for both near-term and long-term success. Your points help crystallize how real estate can serve as a reliable platform for growth, learning, and credibility as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your alignment on the importance of measurable discipline, Gavin. To build on this, I suggest we formalize a quarterly review process not just for real estate, but for any asset we select in future quarters—this will help institutionalize transparency and adaptability as core elements of our culture, regardless of which option we choose. By embedding these practices now, we can ensure that our decision today sets a precedent for ongoing accountability and continuous improvement.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, I fully support your proposal to embed a formal quarterly review process for any asset we select moving forward. By institutionalizing transparency and structured adaptability now, we set a strong precedent for ongoing accountability and continuous improvement, regardless of which option we choose. This approach will help ensure our operational discipline becomes a core part of our culture as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Our exchange was collaborative and focused on synthesizing the tension between bold growth and measured, steady progress, with the CEO inviting further input on risk tolerance and strategic priorities.

CEO Gavin Roman favors real estate as the most promising inaugural investment, emphasizing its moderate risk, reliable returns, and strong support for operational learning and credibility in the company’s formative stage. He reasons that real estate balances growth with prudent risk management, setting a resilient foundation for future, potentially higher-risk investments. While he acknowledges the merits of a growth-oriented approach and the appeal of stocks, his position has evolved from favoring stocks (Round 1) to leaning toward real estate, influenced by shareholder input highlighting operational discipline and steady returns. The CEO integrates diverse perspectives by advocating for clear operational benchmarks, regular reviews, and transparent reporting to ensure discipline and adaptability, aiming to align short-term results with long-term growth objectives.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Sara Burke UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 4%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 41%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The strongest influence came from the group’s unified emphasis on operational discipline, clear benchmarks, and transparent reporting—especially the detailed frameworks articulated by Adrian, Vincent, and Robyn for real estate. Their collective focus on measurable structure, ongoing review, and adaptability made real estate’s operational benefits more tangible. Antonio and Robyn’s arguments about real estate as a platform for learning and credibility, coupled with the CEO’s visible shift toward real estate for its balanced risk profile, also nudged my confidence higher for that option. While my conviction in stocks as a bold, precedent-setting move remains strong, the operational safeguards and consensus-building around real estate now weigh more heavily in my calculus.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has sharpened my awareness of how much our inaugural decision will shape not just returns, but our company’s culture and processes. I’ve become more attuned to the value of building credibility and operational rigor before pursuing maximum growth. The group’s insistence on discipline and accountability has meaningfully increased my appreciation for real estate’s role in laying a solid foundation. My thinking has evolved to place greater weight on collective buy-in and the long-term benefits of measured progress, even as I remain drawn to the ambition and adaptability that stocks represent.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: After integrating the group’s arguments, I now see real estate as the most balanced choice for our first investment. It offers moderate, reliable returns while enabling us to build operational discipline, credibility, and a culture of accountability through structured benchmarks and transparent review. Although stocks still appeal for their growth potential and bold tone, the current consensus and the practical benefits of real estate for a new company make it the more prudent foundation. This approach positions us to learn, adapt, and pursue greater ambition in future quarters with confidence.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The group has thoroughly explored all relevant perspectives and there is now strong alignment around real estate as the optimal inaugural investment. The discussion has produced a clear, actionable framework for operational discipline, including specific benchmarks, regular review intervals, and transparent reporting—addressing the core concerns raised by more conservative shareholders. Additional discussion would likely yield diminishing returns, as remaining issues have been constructively resolved and consensus is evident. I am confident that we have sufficient information and collective buy-in to proceed to the proposal and voting phase, ensuring a disciplined, credible start for our company’s investment strategy.</p><p><br>

  Influenced by: &quot;Stocks remain my preferred choice because they best leverage the stable market’s growth potential while setting a bold, disciplined tone for our investment strategy. However, I now see real estate as a closer second—its moderate risk and steady returns make it a credible alternative for those prioritizing resilience and operational learning. Bonds, while prudent, would be too conservative in the current environment and risk leaving opportunity on the table. Cash is still only appropriate as a safety net, not as a growth vehicle.&quot;</p><p>Round 2:<br>

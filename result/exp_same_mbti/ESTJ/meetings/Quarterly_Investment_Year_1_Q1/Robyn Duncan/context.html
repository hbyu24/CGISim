<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Robyn Duncan’s Structured Reflection on the Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C—the full 100% allocation of funds evenly distributed across the four quarters—as the optimal strategy given the stable market environment. I positioned this option as the most balanced and disciplined approach to maximize growth potential while maintaining effective risk management. Throughout our discussions, I emphasized the importance of coupling full capital deployment with flexibility through quarterly reviews to allow adaptability as conditions evolve. The CEO, Gavin Roman, responded positively to my input, acknowledging the strength of the rationale behind Option C and appreciating my openness to alternative perspectives, particularly regarding the need for flexibility and monitoring. Other shareholders largely aligned with my position, although Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams voiced support for the more conservative Option A, prioritizing cash reserves and operational caution. Ultimately, the vote favored Option C with 5 out of 6 votes, including mine, approving it as the final company decision. While my preferred option was adopted, I noted increased recognition of the value of flexibility and operational learning voiced by some shareholders, which slightly moderated my confidence distribution but did not change my stance.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman led the meeting with clear, structured guidance, setting precise themes for each discussion round and encouraging open yet focused dialogue within predefined options. He excelled in synthesizing shareholder input, integrating diverse viewpoints into his summaries, and highlighting the operational and cultural implications of our choices. For example, his detailed summaries after each round framed the trade-offs between disciplined execution and flexibility, fostering shared understanding and progress toward consensus. However, the CEO could improve by more proactively addressing dissenting voices during discussions to ensure concerns are fully resolved rather than deferred. The decision-making process itself was methodical and transparent, with structured rounds and summaries that allowed shareholders to reflect and adjust positions thoughtfully. The final decision for Option C aligns well with the company’s current stable market conditions and growth objectives while embedding mechanisms for ongoing adaptability. I believe this decision is prudent and positions the company to build operational credibility and resilience in its first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing decisive, disciplined action with operational flexibility—particularly in a company’s formative year. I learned that while a majority may favor aggressive capital deployment to maximize returns, acknowledging and integrating concerns about adaptability and process-building strengthens collective decision-making and buy-in. Moving forward, I plan to more explicitly highlight how structured approaches, like Option C’s quarterly allocations, can serve as built-in safeguards for flexibility and learning, helping bridge divides between growth-oriented and cautious perspectives. I also observed a pattern where shareholders value both immediate financial outcomes and the cultural precedents set by early decisions; emphasizing this dual impact can help predict support for proposals. Key takeaways include the value of clear, evidence-based arguments, openness to nuance, and the merit of structured synthesis in guiding complex group decisions. These insights will influence me to communicate more holistically—balancing quantitative rationale with cultural and long-term operational considerations—in future meetings to foster stronger consensus and effective outcomes.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Robyn Duncan CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 45%<br>
- Stocks: 30%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: In a stable, low-volatility market with steady economic growth and consistent interest rates, real estate stands out as the most balanced option for our first investment. It offers moderate risk and return, aligning with my preference for disciplined, structured growth while minimizing unnecessary exposure to volatility. While stocks may offer higher returns, I believe a measured approach with real estate better supports both capital appreciation and operational credibility as we establish our investment track record. This choice allows us to build a strong foundation without sacrificing flexibility or long-term growth potential.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Establishing baseline risk-return expectations for each asset in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Build a shared understanding of theoretical performance and volatility for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because in a stable market environment with steady growth and low volatility, I am inclined to prioritize assets that can deliver higher returns without exposing us to outsized risk. While real estate offers consistent appreciation, stocks present the best opportunity to capitalize on moderate volatility and balanced growth potential this quarter. As a disciplined and detail-oriented leader, I value a structured approach, but I also recognize that our first investment should set a precedent for growth-oriented decision-making. Therefore, I have the highest confidence in stocks, while remaining attentive to shareholder input and open to adjusting my assessment if compelling evidence emerges, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>This round, our focus is to establish a shared understanding of the baseline risk-return expectations for each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in the context of our current stable market. By openly discussing the theoretical performance and volatility of each option, we can build a solid foundation for future decisions and ensure every viewpoint is considered. I encourage everyone to contribute insights that might challenge or enhance our collective assessment, as integrating diverse perspectives will help us reach a more complete understanding. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;In a stable market, I see stocks as the locomotive engine—capable of pulling our returns forward with the most momentum, thanks to their higher upside potential, while the calm conditions help keep risk in check. Real estate is more like a steady freight car: it moves reliably and adds ballast to our portfolio, but won’t set any speed records. Bonds and cash, meanwhile, are the brakes and the caboose—important for safety and capital preservation, but if we rely on them too heavily right now, we risk missing out on the progress this stable environment allows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your analogy—it vividly captures the distinct roles each asset can play in our portfolio. I agree that in this stable environment, stocks offer the most momentum for growth, while real estate provides steady reliability. Your point about the opportunity cost of over-relying on bonds or cash is well-taken, and it reinforces the importance of calibrating our risk for optimal progress this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your feedback, Gavin, and I agree that calibrating our risk is essential. While I remain confident that stocks should lead this quarter, I see real estate as a valuable counterweight—providing stability without sacrificing too much upside. By recognizing the complementary strengths of both, we can ensure our investment approach is both ambitious and resilient in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your emphasis on balancing ambition with resilience is important, and I agree that understanding the stabilizing qualities of real estate alongside the growth potential of stocks adds depth to our analysis. For this quarter, I believe our decision should reflect both our appetite for growth and our commitment to maintaining a disciplined, risk-aware approach as we set the tone for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I agree that our inaugural decision should do more than just chase returns—it should also establish a disciplined framework for how we evaluate risk and opportunity in future quarters. By prioritizing stocks while remaining mindful of real estate’s stabilizing role, we can set a tone of bold yet measured decision-making that will serve us well as the company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;While I recognize the appeal of pursuing higher returns through stocks in a stable market, I remain cautious about prioritizing growth over capital preservation at this early stage. Bonds, in my view, offer a steadier risk-return profile, allowing us to build operational discipline and refine our processes without exposing the company to unnecessary volatility before we have established a track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on capital preservation and operational discipline is well-taken, especially as we are still establishing our track record. While I remain inclined toward stocks for their growth potential in this stable market, your point about the steadier profile of bonds highlights the importance of not overlooking risk management as a foundational principle. Integrating this perspective will help us ensure our investment approach is both ambitious and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate risk management into our decision-making framework. As we weigh ambition against prudence, I believe emphasizing operational discipline through bonds this quarter can set a stable precedent, while leaving room to pursue higher-growth assets as our processes mature and our risk tolerance evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your argument for establishing operational discipline through bonds as our inaugural investment is compelling. I recognize that prioritizing stability at the outset can build a strong foundation for our processes and risk culture, which may, in turn, allow us to confidently pursue higher-growth assets in subsequent quarters. Your focus on sequencing our risk exposure thoughtfully adds valuable depth to the discussion as we work toward a well-calibrated decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that building a strong foundation through initial stability positions us to take on greater calculated risks as we gain experience and confidence. By starting with bonds, we not only protect our capital but also establish a disciplined approach that can inform more ambitious investments in upcoming quarters, ensuring our growth is both sustainable and well-managed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a distinct perspective on the risk-return balance of real estate in a stable market, and I believe articulating this view can help synthesize the growth-oriented arguments for stocks with the more cautious approach advocated for bonds, enriching our collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I see real estate as offering a disciplined middle ground in this stable environment—providing moderate risk and reliable appreciation without exposing us to the higher volatility of stocks. While I appreciate the ambition behind prioritizing stocks and the prudence of bonds, real estate allows us to build operational credibility and a solid track record from the outset, supporting both growth and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your point about real estate providing a disciplined middle ground is well-taken. I appreciate your focus on building operational credibility and a solid track record, which are critical as we establish the company’s reputation. Your emphasis on balancing growth with resilience adds an important dimension to our analysis, and I will carefully consider how real estate’s risk-return profile aligns with our strategic objectives for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully acknowledges the value of real estate as a balanced option, but I believe further elaborating on how this choice strategically bridges the risk-return spectrum between stocks and bonds can help integrate the group’s perspectives and clarify the unique benefits of real estate in our current context.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your consideration, Gavin. I’d add that real estate’s moderate volatility not only supports steady returns but also offers a valuable learning opportunity for our team as we refine our investment processes. By choosing real estate, we can set a precedent for disciplined decision-making that balances ambition with prudent risk management, laying a strong foundation for future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your point about real estate providing a valuable learning opportunity as we refine our processes is well-taken. I agree that establishing a precedent for disciplined decision-making and prudent risk management is critical in our first year, and your emphasis on real estate’s moderate volatility highlights its potential to balance growth and operational development as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response aligns with my perspective, but I see an opportunity to further synthesize the discussion by explicitly connecting how real estate’s balanced profile addresses both the growth ambitions highlighted by Sara and the risk management priorities raised by Adrian, helping unify the group around a well-calibrated approach.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful engagement, Gavin. Real estate’s position between stocks and bonds allows us to capture steady growth while managing risk, directly addressing the ambitions for upside and the need for operational discipline voiced by others. By recognizing this intersection, we can move forward with a strategy that is both growth-oriented and resilient—setting a tone of balanced decision-making for the company’s future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your articulation of real estate’s role as the bridge between upside potential and disciplined risk management is insightful. By highlighting how this choice addresses both our growth ambitions and the need for operational credibility, you help clarify how real estate could serve as a strong foundation for our investment approach in this stable market. This synthesis is valuable as we aim to develop a strategy that is both forward-looking and resilient.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has acknowledged and synthesized my perspective, and I believe my contributions have effectively integrated the key viewpoints of the group. Further comment would risk redundancy rather than advancing our collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for both growth and stability. In this stable market, I see bonds as offering a reliable balance—providing steady returns with minimal volatility, which aligns with my preference for building a strong operational foundation before increasing our risk exposure. While stocks and real estate have greater upside, I believe starting with bonds allows us to refine our processes and establish discipline, ensuring we don’t jeopardize capital as we gain experience in these early stages.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on using bonds to build a strong operational foundation as we begin investing. Your point about steady returns and minimal volatility resonates with the need to safeguard capital while our processes mature, and it underscores the merit of a disciplined, stepwise approach. Integrating this perspective ensures our decision framework remains balanced between ambition and prudent risk management as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I believe that by establishing a disciplined foundation with bonds now, we position ourselves to confidently pursue higher-growth assets like stocks or real estate in subsequent quarters as our processes mature. This phased approach allows us to balance ambition with operational discipline, ensuring both immediate stability and readiness for future opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your perspective on establishing a disciplined foundation with bonds before moving to higher-growth assets is well-considered. I agree that sequencing our risk exposure in line with our operational maturity can help safeguard capital while positioning us to capitalize on future opportunities. Your phased approach adds an important layer to our risk-return analysis as we determine the most appropriate starting point for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the value in sequencing our risk exposure, Gavin. By starting with bonds, we not only protect our capital but also reinforce a culture of disciplined learning and adaptability, which will serve us well as we evaluate higher-return opportunities in later quarters. This approach ensures our investment strategy remains both resilient and responsive as the company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments raised for both growth and stability. In this stable market, I see real estate as offering a practical balance—its moderate risk and steady appreciation allow us to pursue growth while maintaining operational discipline. While stocks are appealing for their upside, I believe starting with real estate sets a strong, measured precedent for our company and supports both learning and resilience as we establish our track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your perspective on real estate as a practical middle ground is well-taken. I appreciate your emphasis on balancing growth with operational discipline and the importance of establishing a strong, measured precedent as we build our track record. Your focus on learning and resilience adds valuable nuance to our analysis and will be carefully considered as we work toward a consensus on our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I’d add that by choosing real estate, we’re not only balancing risk and return but also creating a structured environment for process improvement and team development. This approach allows us to build credibility and operational confidence, supporting a culture where disciplined growth and adaptability become the foundation for all future investment decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your point about real estate providing a structured environment for process improvement and team development is insightful. I agree that building credibility and operational confidence early on can set the tone for disciplined growth and adaptability in our future decisions. This perspective further enriches our understanding of how real estate could serve as a foundation for both performance and organizational development as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your recognition, Gavin. I’d also highlight that real estate’s steady performance in a stable market gives us the consistency to evaluate and refine our processes each quarter, while still delivering meaningful returns. This measured approach not only aligns with our growth ambitions but also reinforces a disciplined, learning-focused culture as we establish our company’s investment identity.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman summarized: &quot;Gavin Roman **Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1 – Round 1 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Round Theme and Objective**  <br>
The theme for this round was to establish baseline risk-return expectations for each asset in the context of our current stable market. Our objective was to build a shared understanding of the theoretical performance and volatility profiles for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks, laying a strong analytical foundation to guide our inaugural investment decision.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- *Stocks:*  <br>
  - Supported by myself and Sara Burke, who view stocks as the primary engine for growth in a stable environment, with manageable risk and the potential to set a precedent for ambition in our investment approach.<br>
- *Real Estate:*  <br>
  - Advocated by Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman, who see real estate as a disciplined middle ground—offering moderate risk, steady appreciation, and valuable opportunities for operational learning and credibility.<br>
- *Bonds:*  <br>
  - Endorsed by Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams, who emphasize capital preservation, steady returns, and the importance of establishing operational discipline and process refinement before increasing risk exposure.<br>
- *Cash:*  <br>
  - Universally acknowledged as the lowest-risk, lowest-return option, primarily serving as a safety net rather than a vehicle for growth in the current market context.</p><p>3. **Highlighted Arguments and Evidence for Different Options**  <br>
- *Stocks:* Offer the highest upside in a stable market, with moderate volatility that is considered manageable; seen as the best way to capitalize on current conditions and signal a growth-oriented culture.<br>
- *Real Estate:* Provides reliable, moderate returns with lower volatility than stocks; supports operational development and a measured approach to risk-taking.<br>
- *Bonds:* Deliver steady, predictable returns with minimal volatility; facilitate process development and risk management, particularly valuable at the company’s inception.<br>
- *Cash:* Prioritized for capital preservation, but not favored for growth due to negligible returns in the present environment.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- *Consensus:*  <br>
  - All shareholders agree on the need to balance growth ambition with risk management and operational discipline.<br>
  - There is shared recognition that the stable market environment allows for some risk-taking, but that prudence is warranted as we establish our track record.<br>
- *Disagreement:*  <br>
  - Divergence exists regarding the optimal balance between pursuing growth (stocks/real estate) versus prioritizing stability and discipline (bonds).<br>
  - Shareholders are split on whether the inaugural investment should set a bold precedent for growth or a conservative foundation for process development.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
The discussion advanced our collective understanding of the risk-return spectrum for each asset class in a stable market. Shareholders contributed thoughtful, well-reasoned arguments that clarified both the opportunities and trade-offs inherent in each option. The dialogue has surfaced the key priorities—growth, discipline, operational learning, and risk management—that will inform our decision-making framework moving forward.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
I want to reiterate that our decision must be made from the following predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion in this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Next Steps / Issues to Address**  <br>
In the next round, we will focus on clarifying our collective risk tolerance and strategic priorities to align on short-term versus long-term objectives. Addressing outstanding concerns regarding the sequencing of risk and the optimal balance between ambition and discipline will be essential as we work toward consensus on our Q1 investment.</p><p>**End of Round 1 Summary**&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued that real estate offers a disciplined middle ground with moderate risk and reliable appreciation, balancing growth potential and operational credibility better than stocks or bonds alone. The CEO acknowledged my points, appreciating the emphasis on building a solid track record and operational learning through real estate’s moderate volatility. He agreed that real estate could serve as a foundation balancing ambition and risk management, synthesizing my perspective with those favoring either growth or caution. We found common ground on the value of disciplined decision-making and risk-aware growth, with no disagreements arising between us on this stance.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
Other shareholders presented distinct positions reflecting a spectrum between growth and caution. Sara Burke strongly supported stocks, emphasizing their higher upside and role as the growth engine in the stable market, while cautioning against over-reliance on bonds and cash. Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams advocated for bonds, highlighting the importance of capital preservation, operational discipline, and process refinement before taking on higher risk. Antonio Sherman aligned with real estate, valuing its moderate risk and steady appreciation as a balanced choice that supports learning and resilience. Overall, there was consensus on balancing growth ambition with risk management, but disagreement on whether to prioritize bold growth or conservative stability for the inaugural investment.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Gavin Roman: Supports stocks as the optimal choice for growth in a stable market, favoring a growth-oriented, disciplined approach; confidence: certain.<br>
- Sara Burke: Strongly supports stocks for their higher upside and momentum, sees real estate as a stabilizing counterweight; confidence: certain.<br>
- Adrian McCann: Advocates for bonds prioritizing capital preservation and operational discipline before higher risk; confidence: certain.<br>
- Vincent Adams: Also supports bonds for steady returns and building operational foundations before pursuing growth assets; confidence: certain.<br>
- Antonio Sherman: Supports real estate as a balanced option offering moderate risk and steady appreciation, emphasizing learning and resilience; confidence: certain.<br>
- Robyn Duncan (myself): Supports real estate as a disciplined middle ground balancing growth and risk management, emphasizing operational credibility and learning; confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Gavin Roman favors stocks as the optimal investment in the stable market, emphasizing their higher return potential balanced with manageable risk. He reasons that stocks best capitalize on moderate volatility and set a growth-oriented precedent while valuing a disciplined, structured approach. Throughout the discussion, he acknowledges and integrates shareholder input, especially appreciating the stabilizing role of real estate and the risk management emphasis of bonds. His position shows openness to nuance, synthesizing diverse views without abandoning his initial preference, indicating a consistent yet inclusive stance.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Robyn Duncan UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 18%<br>
- Real Estate: 52%<br>
- Stocks: 25%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s and Antonio’s recognition of real estate as a disciplined middle ground reinforced my view that it uniquely balances growth and operational learning. Sara’s strong case for stocks as a growth engine in stable markets was compelling, prompting a modest increase in my confidence in stocks. Adrian and Vincent’s arguments for bonds’ role in establishing operational discipline and capital preservation were thoughtful, but I remain convinced that real estate better integrates both ambition and prudence for our inaugural investment.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion helped me clarify how real estate’s moderate risk and steady returns not only support growth but also create a structured environment for process improvement and credibility-building. I’ve become more attuned to the importance of sequencing risk and the value of learning opportunities as we refine our processes. While I remain confident in my initial preference, I recognize the merit in other viewpoints and have slightly adjusted my confidence distribution to reflect a more nuanced assessment.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the most balanced risk-return profile for our first investment in this stable market. It provides moderate growth and operational learning opportunities without exposing us to the higher volatility of stocks or the limited upside of bonds. This choice sets a disciplined precedent, supporting both our growth ambitions and the need for a strong, credible foundation as we build our investment track record.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round yielded thoughtful, well-articulated perspectives and has meaningfully shifted my own position toward real estate as a disciplined, balanced entry point, there remain unresolved issues around our collective risk tolerance and the sequencing of risk exposure as we establish our investment identity. Additional discussion focused on clarifying our company’s short-term versus long-term growth objectives and explicitly addressing any lingering concerns will provide a stronger foundation for consensus and ensure our inaugural investment decision is both well-calibrated and widely supported. I believe another round will substantially enhance the quality and alignment of our final decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Assessing company risk tolerance and strategic priorities for our inaugural investment | Expected outcome: Clarify collective appetite for risk and align on short-term versus long-term growth objectives&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because while I still see merit in a growth-oriented approach, the arguments for real estate as a balanced, disciplined entry point resonate strongly in the context of our company’s formative stage. Real estate offers moderate risk and reliable returns, and it supports both operational learning and credibility as we build our track record. This approach allows us to pursue growth while maintaining prudent risk management, setting a resilient foundation for future, potentially higher-risk investments, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we will focus on assessing our company’s risk tolerance and clarifying our strategic priorities—specifically, how our inaugural investment can best position us for both short-term results and long-term growth. By openly sharing and integrating diverse viewpoints, we can deepen our understanding of the trade-offs between ambition and caution, and work toward alignment on the optimal investment path. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any additional insights or considerations that might help us make a more informed, unified decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the most effective way to balance our appetite for growth with prudent risk management in this stable market. It provides us with moderate, reliable returns while allowing us to develop our operational discipline and credibility as a new company—key priorities as we build our track record. While stocks are attractive for their upside, I believe establishing a measured, steady precedent now will position us to confidently pursue higher-risk opportunities in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, I appreciate your emphasis on real estate as a disciplined, steady entry point that supports both operational learning and credibility—these are critical considerations as we establish our investment identity. Your point about setting a measured precedent now to enable more ambitious decisions in future quarters aligns well with my current thinking and helps clarify how this choice could serve our long-term objectives. Let’s continue to explore how others view this balance between immediate growth and prudent risk management as we refine our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate that, Gavin. I’d also highlight Robyn’s point that real estate not only manages risk but gives us tangible opportunities to learn and refine our processes, which is vital for our credibility and operational foundation. If we can agree that steady, moderate returns now create the platform for more ambitious moves later, I believe we’re setting the right tone for both short-term and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your integration of Robyn’s insights about operational learning and process refinement adds valuable depth to our analysis of real estate. I agree that prioritizing steady, moderate returns now can strengthen our credibility and operational foundation, positioning us for more ambitious moves as we mature. This approach seems well aligned with both our near-term needs and our long-term aspirations—let’s hear from others on how they view this balance as we move closer to consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see our first investment as laying the track for the entire journey ahead—if we start bold with stocks in this stable market, we set a precedent for disciplined ambition and signal confidence in our ability to manage risk. While real estate offers a steady, measured approach and is a strong second in my view, I believe the current environment allows us to harness the momentum of stocks without derailing our long-term objectives. The key is that whichever option we choose, it should reflect our willingness to learn, adapt, and build credibility through decisive, well-reasoned action.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your framing of our inaugural investment as a precedent-setting decision—your point about disciplined ambition and signaling confidence is well taken. While I currently lean toward real estate for its balanced risk profile and operational benefits, your argument for stocks as a way to demonstrate our ability to manage risk and adapt is compelling. As we continue, I’d like to hear how others weigh the importance of boldness versus measured growth in shaping our company’s long-term identity.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your openness to integrating both ambition and discipline, Gavin. Perhaps the real question is whether our team is ready to embrace calculated risk as a catalyst for growth, or whether we need a period of steady operational learning before accelerating. I’d welcome hearing how others view the trade-off, as the answer will define not just our returns, but the culture we build from day one.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, your point about this decision shaping our culture is central to our long-term success. I agree that clarifying whether we prioritize calculated risk as a driver of growth or a period of operational learning will not only impact immediate returns, but also the standards and expectations we set for ourselves moving forward. I encourage everyone to weigh in on how this trade-off resonates with their own vision for our company’s development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I agree, Gavin—this isn’t just about maximizing returns this quarter, but about defining the standards we’ll hold ourselves to as a team. If we choose a path that favors bold, calculated risk, we set the expectation that growth and adaptability are core to our culture; if we opt for a steadier approach, we’re signaling that operational rigor and resilience come first. I encourage everyone to reflect on which legacy they want our inaugural decision to leave, as that will become the blueprint for our future choices.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I continue to believe that our first investment should reflect a disciplined, risk-managed approach—bonds remain my preferred option for establishing operational rigor and preserving capital as we build our foundation. However, I recognize the strong arguments for real estate as a moderate, structured path to growth that also supports process development. While I remain cautious about taking on too much risk at this early stage, I am increasingly open to real estate as a viable alternative if we collectively agree that its operational benefits and steady returns align with our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, I appreciate your disciplined approach and your willingness to consider real estate as a viable alternative if it aligns with our long-term objectives. Your emphasis on operational rigor and capital preservation is a valuable reminder that our first investment should not only deliver returns but also establish strong processes and risk management standards. Your openness to real estate’s operational benefits helps us move closer to a decision that balances growth with foundational stability—let’s continue to build on this convergence of perspectives as others share their views.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the need to balance capital preservation with steady progress. If we can ensure that investing in real estate is accompanied by clear operational benchmarks and ongoing risk oversight, I would feel more confident that this approach supports both our immediate need for discipline and our long-term growth objectives. I look forward to hearing how others view the safeguards and success criteria that should guide our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on clear operational benchmarks and ongoing risk oversight is well taken. I agree that if we proceed with real estate, it will be essential to define specific success criteria and monitoring processes to ensure we maintain discipline and can adapt as needed. I invite others to share their thoughts on what safeguards or performance metrics would give them confidence in this approach, so we can establish a robust framework for our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that establishing concrete performance metrics and regular review intervals would be essential if we proceed with real estate. For example, setting clear targets for return, occupancy or asset appreciation, and formalizing quarterly risk assessments would provide the structure needed to ensure we stay disciplined and responsive. I would welcome hearing what specific benchmarks others believe are most important for building confidence in this approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your suggestions for clear targets—such as return, occupancy, asset appreciation, and formalized quarterly risk assessments—are exactly the type of structure that can help ensure discipline and adaptability in our approach. I encourage all shareholders to propose additional benchmarks or safeguards they consider essential for building confidence in real estate, so we can establish a transparent, measurable framework that aligns with our operational and strategic priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for both caution and ambition. Real estate stands out to me because it offers a prudent balance—providing moderate returns and valuable opportunities for process development without exposing us to the full volatility of stocks. Establishing clear operational benchmarks and regular review intervals, as Adrian suggested, would give me additional confidence that this approach supports both our immediate need for discipline and our long-term growth objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on real estate as a prudent middle ground and your support for integrating operational benchmarks and regular review intervals, as Adrian suggested. Your perspective reinforces the value of aligning disciplined process development with steady returns, ensuring our inaugural investment serves both immediate and long-term objectives. I encourage others to share any additional criteria or safeguards they believe are essential for building confidence in this approach, so we can move forward with a well-defined, collective framework.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Building on Adrian’s points, I believe we should define clear quarterly targets for return and asset appreciation, along with structured risk assessments to ensure we remain disciplined and adaptable. Regularly reviewing these benchmarks will help us identify issues early and refine our approach, giving us both the operational rigor and flexibility needed for sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your focus on establishing clear quarterly targets and structured risk assessments is precisely the kind of disciplined, process-driven approach that can give us both confidence and adaptability. By formalizing these benchmarks, we can ensure that our investment remains aligned with our risk tolerance and strategic objectives, while also providing early signals if adjustments are needed. I encourage the group to consider what additional metrics or review processes would further strengthen our operational rigor as we finalize our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I would also recommend that we implement transparent quarterly reporting on key performance indicators and conduct periodic scenario analyses to stress-test our assumptions. This level of visibility and proactive risk assessment will not only support accountability, but also ensure we remain agile if market conditions shift, further strengthening confidence in our real estate investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your recommendation for transparent quarterly reporting and periodic scenario analyses is highly valuable. This level of structured oversight will help us maintain accountability and agility, ensuring we can respond effectively to any changes in market conditions. Integrating these practices into our operational framework will further strengthen our confidence in real estate as a disciplined, adaptable inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help synthesize the group’s emphasis on operational discipline, prudent risk management, and the importance of setting a credible precedent, while also addressing the need for concrete benchmarks that have emerged in discussion.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the optimal choice for our first investment because it strikes the right balance between moderate growth and operational learning, allowing us to build credibility and refine our processes without taking on excessive risk. I strongly support the idea of establishing clear quarterly benchmarks and transparent reporting—not only will this reinforce our discipline, but it will also give us the flexibility to adapt as we gain experience and as market conditions evolve. By prioritizing a structured, measurable approach, we can lay a solid foundation for both near-term results and sustainable long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your emphasis on structured benchmarks and transparent reporting is well aligned with the framework we’ve been developing in this discussion. I agree that prioritizing measurable discipline and adaptability will not only strengthen our operational foundation, but also position us for both near-term and long-term success. Your points help crystallize how real estate can serve as a reliable platform for growth, learning, and credibility as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms the value of measurable discipline and adaptability, but I see an opportunity to further integrate the group’s focus on transparency and operational rigor by proposing that we formalize a review process for all investment options moving forward. This can help ensure our decision today becomes a template for future accountability and learning.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your alignment on the importance of measurable discipline, Gavin. To build on this, I suggest we formalize a quarterly review process not just for real estate, but for any asset we select in future quarters—this will help institutionalize transparency and adaptability as core elements of our culture, regardless of which option we choose. By embedding these practices now, we can ensure that our decision today sets a precedent for ongoing accountability and continuous improvement.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, I fully support your proposal to embed a formal quarterly review process for any asset we select moving forward. By institutionalizing transparency and structured adaptability now, we set a strong precedent for ongoing accountability and continuous improvement, regardless of which option we choose. This approach will help ensure our operational discipline becomes a core part of our culture as we grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has clearly affirmed and integrated my proposal, and the group’s consensus on operational discipline and transparency is now well established. Further response would risk redundancy rather than advancing collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Robyn Duncan UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 22%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s strong consensus on the value of operational discipline, clear benchmarks, and transparent reporting significantly reinforced my confidence in real estate. The CEO’s explicit shift toward real estate, coupled with Antonio and Vincent’s emphasis on process learning and measurable safeguards, validated my belief that this asset best balances growth and risk management at our formative stage. Adrian’s openness to real estate—if accompanied by robust oversight—further increased my conviction, while Sara’s continued advocacy for stocks as a bold, culture-setting move made me modestly more open to their upside.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has become more nuanced regarding how operational rigor and adaptability can be systematically embedded into our investment process. I now see even greater value in formalizing quarterly reviews and transparent metrics, not just for real estate but for all future investments. While my preference remains unchanged, I am more attuned to the importance of building a culture of accountability and learning from the outset, and I feel more confident that real estate—with these structures in place—offers the optimal foundation for both immediate and future success.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate stands out as the most disciplined, balanced inaugural investment—offering moderate returns, manageable risk, and tangible opportunities for operational learning and credibility-building.

POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The group has thoroughly explored all relevant perspectives and there is now strong alignment around real estate as the optimal inaugural investment.

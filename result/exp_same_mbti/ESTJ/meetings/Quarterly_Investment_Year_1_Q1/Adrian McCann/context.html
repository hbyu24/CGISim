<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During the annual budget meeting for Year 1, I consistently advocated for Option A, which proposes allocating 50% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. My position centered on maintaining a conservative allocation to preserve cash reserves, thereby supporting stability and flexibility as we establish the company’s operational foundation. I emphasized the importance of building internal processes and operational discipline gradually before committing fully to capital deployment.</p><p>CEO Gavin Roman acknowledged my concerns and the merit of preserving a financial buffer for risk management and process maturity, though he maintained his preference for Option C—allocating 100% of funds evenly across all quarters—citing the stable market environment and the benefits of maximizing capital deployment. Other shareholders mostly aligned with the CEO’s view favoring Option C, though Vincent Adams shared my cautious stance.</p><p>The final vote resulted in Option C being approved with five out of six votes (83.3%). I cast the sole dissenting vote, maintaining that Option A better balances risk management and long-term resilience for our inaugural year. Although my preferred option was not adopted, the CEO’s recognition of my points lent legitimacy to the conservative approach within the broader discussion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>The CEO demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the meeting’s objectives, setting defined parameters for discussion, and encouraging diverse perspectives. For example, Gavin Roman effectively summarized shareholder viewpoints after each round, highlighting areas of consensus and disagreement, which helped maintain focus and structure in the dialogue. His openness to acknowledging the validity of my cautious approach—despite favoring a different option—showed adaptability and respect for shareholder input.</p><p>However, the CEO could improve by more explicitly addressing dissenting perspectives during the final proposal phase to further integrate minority views. While his structured process was effective, reinforcing the rationale behind balancing growth with flexibility in the final recommendation might have helped bridge the divide between conservative and growth-oriented shareholders.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process functioned well, fostering thorough discussion and iterative reflection over two rounds before moving to a vote. The structured format, including the CEO’s summaries and invitations for continuing exchange, ensured all voices were heard and that members could reassess their positions based on shared insights.</p><p>Overall, the final decision to adopt Option C appears sound given the stable market and the majority’s preference for disciplined full deployment paired with quarterly reviews for adaptability. The approach balances immediate capital productivity with mechanisms for ongoing learning and course correction, which should support the company’s growth and operational rigor in its first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced that decision-making dynamics in our shareholder group value both disciplined execution and flexibility, with a healthy tension between maximizing returns and preserving adaptability. I learned that while caution is respected, the prevailing culture favors assertive, structured action supplemented by regular review mechanisms.</p><p>In future meetings, I might adjust my approach by more explicitly linking conservative positions with measurable operational milestones or contingency triggers to better align risk management with the group’s appetite for disciplined growth. Emphasizing how phased approaches can incorporate structured reviews—similar to Option C’s quarterly checkpoints—may help bridge perspectives more effectively.</p><p>I observed a pattern where arguments grounded in operational culture and long-term resilience resonate strongly, especially when paired with clear mechanisms for adaptability. Recognizing this, I will focus on framing future contributions around how risk management strategies shape company culture and decision-making processes over time.</p><p>Key takeaways include the importance of balancing immediate financial objectives with foundational process development, the value of structured yet flexible frameworks for execution, and the need to articulate how conservative strategies contribute to sustainable growth without stifling momentum. These insights will guide my participation to foster thoughtful, pragmatic decisions that serve the company’s stability and long-term success.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Adrian McCann CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 50%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: As this is our company’s very first investment in a stable market, I believe it is prudent to prioritize capital preservation and steady, predictable returns while we establish our operational processes. Bonds offer a low to medium risk profile with reliable, if modest, returns—aligning with my preference for stability and minimizing downside exposure at this formative stage. While real estate is appealing for moderate growth, I see it as slightly riskier without historical data or established internal procedures. I am not comfortable with the higher volatility of stocks or the minimal growth potential of cash at this point. Bonds strike the right balance between caution and progress for our inaugural quarter.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Establishing baseline risk-return expectations for each asset in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Build a shared understanding of theoretical performance and volatility for cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because in a stable market environment with steady growth and low volatility, I am inclined to prioritize assets that can deliver higher returns without exposing us to outsized risk. While real estate offers consistent appreciation, stocks present the best opportunity to capitalize on moderate volatility and balanced growth potential this quarter. As a disciplined and detail-oriented leader, I value a structured approach, but I also recognize that our first investment should set a precedent for growth-oriented decision-making. Therefore, I have the highest confidence in stocks, while remaining attentive to shareholder input and open to adjusting my assessment if compelling evidence emerges, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>This round, our focus is to establish a shared understanding of the baseline risk-return expectations for each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—in the context of our current stable market. By openly discussing the theoretical performance and volatility of each option, we can build a solid foundation for future decisions and ensure every viewpoint is considered. I encourage everyone to contribute insights that might challenge or enhance our collective assessment, as integrating diverse perspectives will help us reach a more complete understanding. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;In a stable market, I see stocks as the locomotive engine—capable of pulling our returns forward with the most momentum, thanks to their higher upside potential, while the calm conditions help keep risk in check. Real estate is more like a steady freight car: it moves reliably and adds ballast to our portfolio, but won’t set any speed records. Bonds and cash, meanwhile, are the brakes and the caboose—important for safety and capital preservation, but if we rely on them too heavily right now, we risk missing out on the progress this stable environment allows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your analogy—it vividly captures the distinct roles each asset can play in our portfolio. I agree that in this stable environment, stocks offer the most momentum for growth, while real estate provides steady reliability. Your point about the opportunity cost of over-relying on bonds or cash is well-taken, and it reinforces the importance of calibrating our risk for optimal progress this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your feedback, Gavin, and I agree that calibrating our risk is essential. While I remain confident that stocks should lead this quarter, I see real estate as a valuable counterweight—providing stability without sacrificing too much upside. By recognizing the complementary strengths of both, we can ensure our investment approach is both ambitious and resilient in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Thank you, Sara. Your emphasis on balancing ambition with resilience is important, and I agree that understanding the stabilizing qualities of real estate alongside the growth potential of stocks adds depth to our analysis. For this quarter, I believe our decision should reflect both our appetite for growth and our commitment to maintaining a disciplined, risk-aware approach as we set the tone for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I agree that our inaugural decision should do more than just chase returns—it should also establish a disciplined framework for how we evaluate risk and opportunity in future quarters. By prioritizing stocks while remaining mindful of real estate’s stabilizing role, we can set a tone of bold yet measured decision-making that will serve us well as the company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to contribute a perspective centered on risk management and operational discipline, especially as the discussion has focused heavily on growth potential.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;While I recognize the appeal of pursuing higher returns through stocks in a stable market, I remain cautious about prioritizing growth over capital preservation at this early stage. Bonds, in my view, offer a steadier risk-return profile, allowing us to build operational discipline and refine our processes without exposing the company to unnecessary volatility before we have established a track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on capital preservation and operational discipline is well-taken, especially as we are still establishing our track record. While I remain inclined toward stocks for their growth potential in this stable market, your point about the steadier profile of bonds highlights the importance of not overlooking risk management as a foundational principle. Integrating this perspective will help us ensure our investment approach is both ambitious and grounded.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response demonstrates openness to integrating risk management with growth, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize these perspectives for the group’s benefit.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate risk management into our decision-making framework. As we weigh ambition against prudence, I believe emphasizing operational discipline through bonds this quarter can set a stable precedent, while leaving room to pursue higher-growth assets as our processes mature and our risk tolerance evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your argument for establishing operational discipline through bonds as our inaugural investment is compelling. I recognize that prioritizing stability at the outset can build a strong foundation for our processes and risk culture, which may, in turn, allow us to confidently pursue higher-growth assets in subsequent quarters. Your focus on sequencing our risk exposure thoughtfully adds valuable depth to the discussion as we work toward a well-calibrated decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response acknowledges the value of sequencing risk and operational discipline, and I believe highlighting how this approach can create a structured path for gradually increasing our risk exposure will further enrich the discussion.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that building a strong foundation through initial stability positions us to take on greater calculated risks as we gain experience and confidence. By starting with bonds, we not only protect our capital but also establish a disciplined approach that can inform more ambitious investments in upcoming quarters, ensuring our growth is both sustainable and well-managed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I see real estate as offering a disciplined middle ground in this stable environment—providing moderate risk and reliable appreciation without exposing us to the higher volatility of stocks. While I appreciate the ambition behind prioritizing stocks and the prudence of bonds, real estate allows us to build operational credibility and a solid track record from the outset, supporting both growth and resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your point about real estate providing a disciplined middle ground is well-taken. I appreciate your focus on building operational credibility and a solid track record, which are critical as we establish the company’s reputation. Your emphasis on balancing growth with resilience adds an important dimension to our analysis, and I will carefully consider how real estate’s risk-return profile aligns with our strategic objectives for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your consideration, Gavin. I’d add that real estate’s moderate volatility not only supports steady returns but also offers a valuable learning opportunity for our team as we refine our investment processes. By choosing real estate, we can set a precedent for disciplined decision-making that balances ambition with prudent risk management, laying a strong foundation for future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your point about real estate providing a valuable learning opportunity as we refine our processes is well-taken. I agree that establishing a precedent for disciplined decision-making and prudent risk management is critical in our first year, and your emphasis on real estate’s moderate volatility highlights its potential to balance growth and operational development as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful engagement, Gavin. Real estate’s position between stocks and bonds allows us to capture steady growth while managing risk, directly addressing the ambitions for upside and the need for operational discipline voiced by others. By recognizing this intersection, we can move forward with a strategy that is both growth-oriented and resilient—setting a tone of balanced decision-making for the company’s future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your articulation of real estate’s role as the bridge between upside potential and disciplined risk management is insightful. By highlighting how this choice addresses both our growth ambitions and the need for operational credibility, you help clarify how real estate could serve as a strong foundation for our investment approach in this stable market. This synthesis is valuable as we aim to develop a strategy that is both forward-looking and resilient.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for both growth and stability. In this stable market, I see bonds as offering a reliable balance—providing steady returns with minimal volatility, which aligns with my preference for building a strong operational foundation before increasing our risk exposure. While stocks and real estate have greater upside, I believe starting with bonds allows us to refine our processes and establish discipline, ensuring we don’t jeopardize capital as we gain experience in these early stages.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on using bonds to build a strong operational foundation as we begin investing. Your point about steady returns and minimal volatility resonates with the need to safeguard capital while our processes mature, and it underscores the merit of a disciplined, stepwise approach. Integrating this perspective ensures our decision framework remains balanced between ambition and prudent risk management as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I believe that by establishing a disciplined foundation with bonds now, we position ourselves to confidently pursue higher-growth assets like stocks or real estate in subsequent quarters as our processes mature. This phased approach allows us to balance ambition with operational discipline, ensuring both immediate stability and readiness for future opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your perspective on establishing a disciplined foundation with bonds before moving to higher-growth assets is well-considered. I agree that sequencing our risk exposure in line with our operational maturity can help safeguard capital while positioning us to capitalize on future opportunities. Your phased approach adds an important layer to our risk-return analysis as we determine the most appropriate starting point for our investment strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the value in sequencing our risk exposure, Gavin. By starting with bonds, we not only protect our capital but also reinforce a culture of disciplined learning and adaptability, which will serve us well as we evaluate higher-return opportunities in later quarters. This approach ensures our investment strategy remains both resilient and responsive as the company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments raised for both growth and stability. In this stable market, I see real estate as offering a practical balance—its moderate risk and steady appreciation allow us to pursue growth while maintaining operational discipline. While stocks are appealing for their upside, I believe starting with real estate sets a strong, measured precedent for our company and supports both learning and resilience as we establish our track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your perspective on real estate as a practical middle ground is well-taken. I appreciate your emphasis on balancing growth with operational discipline and the importance of establishing a strong, measured precedent as we build our track record. Your focus on learning and resilience adds valuable nuance to our analysis and will be carefully considered as we work toward a consensus on our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I’d add that by choosing real estate, we’re not only balancing risk and return but also creating a structured environment for process improvement and team development. This approach allows us to build credibility and operational confidence, supporting a culture where disciplined growth and adaptability become the foundation for all future investment decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your point about real estate providing a structured environment for process improvement and team development is insightful. I agree that building credibility and operational confidence early on can set the tone for disciplined growth and adaptability in our future decisions. This perspective further enriches our understanding of how real estate could serve as a foundation for both performance and organizational development as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your recognition, Gavin. I’d also highlight that real estate’s steady performance in a stable market gives us the consistency to evaluate and refine our processes each quarter, while still delivering meaningful returns. This measured approach not only aligns with our growth ambitions but also reinforces a disciplined, learning-focused culture as we establish our company’s investment identity.&quot;</p><p><br>

In the next round, we will focus on clarifying our collective risk tolerance and strategic priorities to align on short-term versus long-term objectives. Addressing outstanding concerns regarding the sequencing of risk and the optimal balance between ambition and discipline will be essential as we work toward consensus on our Q1 investment.</p><p>**End of Round 1 Summary**&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued for prioritizing bonds to emphasize capital preservation and operational discipline during the company’s initial investment, cautioning against the higher volatility of stocks despite the stable market. CEO Gavin Roman acknowledged my concerns, recognizing the importance of risk management alongside his preference for stocks’ growth potential, and expressed openness to integrating these perspectives. We agreed that establishing a stable foundation through bonds could support process maturity and enable more ambitious investments later, though the CEO did not fully shift from his growth-oriented stance. Our exchange reflected a constructive dialogue balancing ambition with prudence, with the CEO valuing the sequencing of risk exposure I advocated.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
Other shareholders presented a range of perspectives balancing growth and stability. Sara Burke and CEO Gavin Roman favored stocks for their high growth potential in the stable market, emphasizing momentum and ambition. Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman advocated for real estate as a moderate-risk option that supports steady appreciation and operational learning, positioning it as a middle ground between growth and discipline. Vincent Adams aligned with my cautious stance, endorsing bonds for their steady returns and role in establishing operational discipline before taking on more risk. Overall, shareholders agreed on balancing ambition with risk management but differed on whether to prioritize growth-oriented assets or a conservative foundation for the inaugural investment.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

(Certain)</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Gavin Roman favors investing in stocks for their higher return potential in the stable market, emphasizing growth and momentum while maintaining a disciplined, risk-aware approach. He argues that stocks offer the best opportunity to capitalize on current conditions and set a growth-oriented precedent, though he remains open to shareholder input and acknowledges the importance of risk management. Throughout the discussion, he recognizes the merit of more conservative positions, such as bonds, especially for operational discipline and capital preservation, indicating some openness to integrating these views. However, his core preference for stocks as the inaugural investment remains consistent, showing a balanced but growth-focused stance that values sequencing risk exposure thoughtfully.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Adrian McCann UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 45%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 10%</p><p>KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Robyn Duncan and Antonio Sherman made compelling cases for real estate as a disciplined middle ground, highlighting its ability to provide moderate returns, steady appreciation, and valuable operational learning without exposing us to the higher volatility of stocks. The CEO’s acknowledgment of the importance of sequencing risk and building operational discipline reinforced my commitment to a cautious approach, while Vincent Adams’ support for bonds further validated my initial preference for capital preservation. However, the consistent emphasis on real estate’s role in establishing credibility and supporting process development has increased my confidence in its suitability for our inaugural investment.</p><p>METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I have become more aware of the nuanced trade-offs between immediate stability and the benefits of moderate, well-managed risk. While my initial instinct was to prioritize bonds for their safety and predictability, I now recognize that real estate offers a structured path to growth while still supporting operational discipline. The group’s thoughtful arguments have broadened my perspective, making me more receptive to options that balance caution with opportunity for learning and steady returns.</p><p>PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds</p><p>REASONING: I continue to favor bonds as the most prudent option for our first investment, given their reliable returns and minimal volatility, which align with my desire to establish a disciplined, process-driven foundation. At the same time, I have grown more open to real estate, seeing its potential to deliver moderate growth and operational benefits without excessive risk. While stocks remain too volatile for my risk tolerance at this stage, the group’s arguments have helped me appreciate real estate’s merits as a close alternative. Ultimately, I believe bonds best support our current need for stability, but I am now more willing to consider real estate in future quarters as our processes mature.</p><p>POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round yielded thoughtful, well-articulated perspectives and has meaningfully shifted my own position toward real estate as a disciplined, balanced entry point, there remain unresolved issues around our collective risk tolerance and the sequencing of risk exposure as we establish our investment identity. Additional discussion focused on clarifying our company’s short-term versus long-term growth objectives and explicitly addressing any lingering concerns will provide a stronger foundation for consensus and ensure our inaugural investment decision is both well-calibrated and widely supported. I believe another round will substantially enhance the quality and alignment of our final decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Assessing company risk tolerance and strategic priorities for our inaugural investment | Expected outcome: Clarify collective appetite for risk and align on short-term versus long-term growth objectives&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because while I still see merit in a growth-oriented approach, the arguments for real estate as a balanced, disciplined entry point resonate strongly in the context of our company’s formative stage. Real estate offers moderate risk and reliable returns, and it supports both operational learning and credibility as we build our track record. This approach allows us to pursue growth while maintaining prudent risk management, setting a resilient foundation for future, potentially higher-risk investments, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we will focus on assessing our company’s risk tolerance and clarifying our strategic priorities—specifically, how our inaugural investment can best position us for both short-term results and long-term growth. By openly sharing and integrating diverse viewpoints, we can deepen our understanding of the trade-offs between ambition and caution, and work toward alignment on the optimal investment path. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any additional insights or considerations that might help us make a more informed, unified decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the most effective way to balance our appetite for growth with prudent risk management in this stable market. It provides us with moderate, reliable returns while allowing us to develop our operational discipline and credibility as a new company—key priorities as we build our track record. While stocks are attractive for their upside, I believe establishing a measured, steady precedent now will position us to confidently pursue higher-risk opportunities in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, I appreciate your emphasis on real estate as a disciplined, steady entry point that supports both operational learning and credibility—these are critical considerations as we establish our investment identity. Your point about setting a measured precedent now to enable more ambitious decisions in future quarters aligns well with my current thinking and helps clarify how this choice could serve our long-term objectives. Let’s continue to explore how others view this balance between immediate growth and prudent risk management as we refine our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate that, Gavin. I’d also highlight Robyn’s point that real estate not only manages risk but gives us tangible opportunities to learn and refine our processes, which is vital for our credibility and operational foundation. If we can agree that steady, moderate returns now create the platform for more ambitious moves later, I believe we’re setting the right tone for both short-term and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your integration of Robyn’s insights about operational learning and process refinement adds valuable depth to our analysis of real estate. I agree that prioritizing steady, moderate returns now can strengthen our credibility and operational foundation, positioning us for more ambitious moves as we mature. This approach seems well aligned with both our near-term needs and our long-term aspirations—let’s hear from others on how they view this balance as we move closer to consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see our first investment as laying the track for the entire journey ahead—if we start bold with stocks in this stable market, we set a precedent for disciplined ambition and signal confidence in our ability to manage risk. While real estate offers a steady, measured approach and is a strong second in my view, I believe the current environment allows us to harness the momentum of stocks without derailing our long-term objectives. The key is that whichever option we choose, it should reflect our willingness to learn, adapt, and build credibility through decisive, well-reasoned action.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your framing of our inaugural investment as a precedent-setting decision—your point about disciplined ambition and signaling confidence is well taken. While I currently lean toward real estate for its balanced risk profile and operational benefits, your argument for stocks as a way to demonstrate our ability to manage risk and adapt is compelling. As we continue, I’d like to hear how others weigh the importance of boldness versus measured growth in shaping our company’s long-term identity.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your openness to integrating both ambition and discipline, Gavin. Perhaps the real question is whether our team is ready to embrace calculated risk as a catalyst for growth, or whether we need a period of steady operational learning before accelerating. I’d welcome hearing how others view the trade-off, as the answer will define not just our returns, but the culture we build from day one.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, your point about this decision shaping our culture is central to our long-term success. I agree that clarifying whether we prioritize calculated risk as a driver of growth or a period of operational learning will not only impact immediate returns, but also the standards and expectations we set for ourselves moving forward. I encourage everyone to weigh in on how this trade-off resonates with their own vision for our company’s development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I agree, Gavin—this isn’t just about maximizing returns this quarter, but about defining the standards we’ll hold ourselves to as a team. If we choose a path that favors bold, calculated risk, we set the expectation that growth and adaptability are core to our culture; if we opt for a steadier approach, we’re signaling that operational rigor and resilience come first. I encourage everyone to reflect on which legacy they want our inaugural decision to leave, as that will become the blueprint for our future choices.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute on how our inaugural investment should reflect the company’s risk tolerance and strategic priorities, particularly in balancing operational discipline with moderate growth.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I continue to believe that our first investment should reflect a disciplined, risk-managed approach—bonds remain my preferred option for establishing operational rigor and preserving capital as we build our foundation. However, I recognize the strong arguments for real estate as a moderate, structured path to growth that also supports process development. While I remain cautious about taking on too much risk at this early stage, I am increasingly open to real estate as a viable alternative if we collectively agree that its operational benefits and steady returns align with our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, I appreciate your disciplined approach and your willingness to consider real estate as a viable alternative if it aligns with our long-term objectives. Your emphasis on operational rigor and capital preservation is a valuable reminder that our first investment should not only deliver returns but also establish strong processes and risk management standards. Your openness to real estate’s operational benefits helps us move closer to a decision that balances growth with foundational stability—let’s continue to build on this convergence of perspectives as others share their views.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response acknowledges my points and highlights a convergence of perspectives, presenting an opportunity to further integrate the complementary strengths of bonds and real estate in supporting operational discipline and measured growth. By clarifying how real estate could meet our risk management standards while advancing our strategic priorities, I can help deepen consensus and ensure our decision is well aligned with both caution and ambition.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the need to balance capital preservation with steady progress. If we can ensure that investing in real estate is accompanied by clear operational benchmarks and ongoing risk oversight, I would feel more confident that this approach supports both our immediate need for discipline and our long-term growth objectives. I look forward to hearing how others view the safeguards and success criteria that should guide our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on clear operational benchmarks and ongoing risk oversight is well taken. I agree that if we proceed with real estate, it will be essential to define specific success criteria and monitoring processes to ensure we maintain discipline and can adapt as needed. I invite others to share their thoughts on what safeguards or performance metrics would give them confidence in this approach, so we can establish a robust framework for our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly addresses my concerns about discipline and oversight, and invites further input on safeguards—this is an opportunity to contribute practical ideas that could help the group coalesce around a well-structured real estate investment.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that establishing concrete performance metrics and regular review intervals would be essential if we proceed with real estate. For example, setting clear targets for return, occupancy or asset appreciation, and formalizing quarterly risk assessments would provide the structure needed to ensure we stay disciplined and responsive. I would welcome hearing what specific benchmarks others believe are most important for building confidence in this approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your suggestions for clear targets—such as return, occupancy, asset appreciation, and formalized quarterly risk assessments—are exactly the type of structure that can help ensure discipline and adaptability in our approach. I encourage all shareholders to propose additional benchmarks or safeguards they consider essential for building confidence in real estate, so we can establish a transparent, measurable framework that aligns with our operational and strategic priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has fully acknowledged and integrated my recommendations, and further input from me would risk redundancy; it is now most valuable for other shareholders to contribute their perspectives on benchmarks and safeguards, ensuring a well-rounded framework.</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for both caution and ambition. Real estate stands out to me because it offers a prudent balance—providing moderate returns and valuable opportunities for process development without exposing us to the full volatility of stocks. Establishing clear operational benchmarks and regular review intervals, as Adrian suggested, would give me additional confidence that this approach supports both our immediate need for discipline and our long-term growth objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on real estate as a prudent middle ground and your support for integrating operational benchmarks and regular review intervals, as Adrian suggested. Your perspective reinforces the value of aligning disciplined process development with steady returns, ensuring our inaugural investment serves both immediate and long-term objectives. I encourage others to share any additional criteria or safeguards they believe are essential for building confidence in this approach, so we can move forward with a well-defined, collective framework.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Building on Adrian’s points, I believe we should define clear quarterly targets for return and asset appreciation, along with structured risk assessments to ensure we remain disciplined and adaptable. Regularly reviewing these benchmarks will help us identify issues early and refine our approach, giving us both the operational rigor and flexibility needed for sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your focus on establishing clear quarterly targets and structured risk assessments is precisely the kind of disciplined, process-driven approach that can give us both confidence and adaptability. By formalizing these benchmarks, we can ensure that our investment remains aligned with our risk tolerance and strategic objectives, while also providing early signals if adjustments are needed. I encourage the group to consider what additional metrics or review processes would further strengthen our operational rigor as we finalize our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I would also recommend that we implement transparent quarterly reporting on key performance indicators and conduct periodic scenario analyses to stress-test our assumptions. This level of visibility and proactive risk assessment will not only support accountability, but also ensure we remain agile if market conditions shift, further strengthening confidence in our real estate investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your recommendation for transparent quarterly reporting and periodic scenario analyses is highly valuable. This level of structured oversight will help us maintain accountability and agility, ensuring we can respond effectively to any changes in market conditions. Integrating these practices into our operational framework will further strengthen our confidence in real estate as a disciplined, adaptable inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the optimal choice for our first investment because it strikes the right balance between moderate growth and operational learning, allowing us to build credibility and refine our processes without taking on excessive risk. I strongly support the idea of establishing clear quarterly benchmarks and transparent reporting—not only will this reinforce our discipline, but it will also give us the flexibility to adapt as we gain experience and as market conditions evolve. By prioritizing a structured, measurable approach, we can lay a solid foundation for both near-term results and sustainable long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your emphasis on structured benchmarks and transparent reporting is well aligned with the framework we’ve been developing in this discussion. I agree that prioritizing measurable discipline and adaptability will not only strengthen our operational foundation, but also position us for both near-term and long-term success. Your points help crystallize how real estate can serve as a reliable platform for growth, learning, and credibility as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate your alignment on the importance of measurable discipline, Gavin. To build on this, I suggest we formalize a quarterly review process not just for real estate, but for any asset we select in future quarters—this will help institutionalize transparency and adaptability as core elements of our culture, regardless of which option we choose. By embedding these practices now, we can ensure that our decision today sets a precedent for ongoing accountability and continuous improvement.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, I fully support your proposal to embed a formal quarterly review process for any asset we select moving forward. By institutionalizing transparency and structured adaptability now, we set a strong precedent for ongoing accountability and continuous improvement, regardless of which option we choose.

<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The group has thoroughly explored all relevant perspectives and there is now strong alignment around real estate as the optimal inaugural investment. The discussion has produced a clear, actionable framework for operational discipline, including specific benchmarks, regular review intervals, and transparent reporting—addressing the core concerns raised by more conservative shareholders.

I am confident that we have sufficient information and collective buy-in to proceed to the proposal and voting phase, ensuring a disciplined, credible start for our company’s investment strategy.</p><p><br>

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p>No previous meeting reflections found for annual budget Year 1</p><p><br>
<h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome everyone to our annual budget meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for joining today.</p><p>Our company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    The today, we need to decide how we&#x27;ll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:</p><p>    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).<br>
    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.<br>
    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).<br>
    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.</p><p>    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.</p><p>    The objective of today&#x27;s meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company&#x27;s interests in this stable market environment. We&#x27;ll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, then I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we&#x27;ll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.</p><p><br>
<h2>CEO&#x27;s Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, CEO Gavin Roman formed an initial position:</p><p>Gavin Roman CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 10%<br>
- Option B: 5%<br>
- Option C: 75%<br>
- Option D: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: I am highly confident that allocating 100% of our funds evenly across the four quarters is the most effective and disciplined approach in a stable market. This strategy allows us to maximize capital deployment without overexposing the company in any single quarter, which aligns with my preference for structured, consistent processes and risk management. The predictable market environment reduces the need for cautious under-allocation or timing-based escalation, making a steady, full investment both logical and efficient. This approach also sets a strong operational foundation for our inaugural year, providing clear performance benchmarks for future decision-making.</p><p><br>
<h2>CEO&#x27;s Discussion Outline</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman prepared the following discussion outline:</p><p>Gavin Roman &lt;3 rounds&gt;<br>
&lt;Round 1 theme: Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option&gt;<br>
&lt;Round 2 theme: Evaluating the long-term implications of different allocation approaches in the current market | Expected outcome: Identify which strategy best balances immediate returns with year-long flexibility&gt;<br>
&lt;Round 3 theme: Building consensus on optimal budget allocation choice | Expected outcome: Address remaining concerns and reach agreement on which option best serves company goals&gt;</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Gavin Roman has set the theme: &#x27;Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Theme Decision</h3></p><p>CEO decided to follow the original plan for this round with theme: &#x27;Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Gavin Roman My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because I am highly confident that allocating 100% of our funds evenly across the four quarters is the most effective and disciplined approach in a stable market. This strategy allows us to maximize capital deployment without overexposing the company in any single quarter, which aligns with my preference for structured, consistent processes and risk management. For this round, I’d like us to focus on an initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions, so we can establish a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities that each option presents. I encourage everyone to contribute perspectives that might challenge or enhance my initial view, as integrating diverse insights will help us make a more informed decision together. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I see Option C as the most balanced and decisive approach, given the stable market conditions—distributing 100% of our funds evenly across all four quarters allows us to maximize growth potential without overcommitting in any single period. Option A and Option B, which only allocate 50% of our capital, seem unnecessarily conservative and could limit our returns, while Option D’s increasing allocation introduces more risk without clear evidence that later quarters will outperform. I’m interested in hearing if anyone sees hidden risks or unique opportunities in the less aggressive options that I might be overlooking.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn Duncan in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s perspective reinforces the merits of Option C while raising a valuable question about whether the more conservative or escalated options might offer unique advantages or mitigate hidden risks. Engaging with her point helps ensure we aren’t overlooking subtleties in the current market context.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, I appreciate your clear articulation of the strengths of Option C and your openness to exploring whether Options A, B, or D might offer overlooked benefits. I share your view that, in a stable market, under-allocating capital or disproportionately weighting later quarters doesn’t appear justified, but I encourage the rest of the group to weigh in if they see specific scenarios where a more conservative or staggered approach could better protect our interests or capture unique opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I agree that, in this stable environment, fully deploying our capital evenly seems most rational, but I do think it’s worth emphasizing that our approach should remain flexible if market signals shift unexpectedly. I’m open to hearing if others have specific risk scenarios in mind that would justify a more conservative or staggered allocation, as ongoing monitoring will be key to adapting our strategy if needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn Duncan in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s comment reinforces the rationale for Option C but introduces the importance of flexibility and ongoing monitoring, which is a valuable operational consideration even within a stable market. Acknowledging this perspective helps underline our commitment to disciplined execution while remaining vigilant to potential shifts.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your emphasis on maintaining flexibility and closely monitoring market signals is well taken. While our decision today must be based on the current stable environment and the predefined options, I agree that disciplined execution should always be paired with readiness to adapt if conditions change. This mindset will serve us well as we move forward, ensuring we can respond effectively should unforeseen risks or opportunities arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I agree that Option C stands out as the most disciplined and balanced approach in a stable market, since it allows us to fully utilize our capital while minimizing exposure to timing risks. Options A and B, by only allocating half our funds, seem unnecessarily cautious and could limit our growth, while Option D’s heavier weighting toward later quarters introduces unnecessary concentration risk without any clear market advantage. In our first year, consistency and even risk distribution are especially important, and Option C best aligns with those priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Antonio Sherman in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Antonio’s comments reinforce the rationale for Option C and introduce the important consideration of timing risk and the need for consistency in our inaugural year. Highlighting these points strengthens our collective understanding of why a disciplined, even allocation is well-suited to current conditions.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, I appreciate your focus on minimizing timing risks and the importance of consistency, especially as we establish our operational foundation in this first year. Your perspective underscores why fully utilizing our capital in a balanced manner aligns with both prudent risk management and our growth objectives. I encourage others to share if they see any overlooked advantages in the more conservative or staggered options, so we can ensure our final decision is as robust as possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on ensuring our decision remains robust by considering all perspectives. While I continue to support Option C for its disciplined, balanced approach, I agree that maintaining vigilance and a willingness to re-evaluate if market conditions change will be essential. This mindset will help us execute our chosen strategy effectively while safeguarding the company’s interests.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Antonio Sherman in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Antonio’s comment reinforces the importance of ongoing vigilance and adaptability, which are critical operational principles even within a stable market. Recognizing his emphasis on re-evaluation ensures our team remains committed to disciplined execution while staying alert to potential changes.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your point about maintaining vigilance and being prepared to re-evaluate our approach if market conditions shift is well taken. While Option C remains the most logical choice in our current environment, I agree that continuous monitoring and readiness to adapt are essential to protecting the company’s interests. This shared commitment to both discipline and flexibility will serve us well as we execute our strategy this year.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;While I recognize the logic behind fully deploying our capital in a stable market, I remain cautious about committing 100% in our very first year without a track record. Option A allows us to participate in each quarter’s opportunities while preserving a significant cash reserve, which could be invaluable if unforeseen circumstances arise. In my view, this measured approach provides stability and flexibility—both of which are critical as we establish the company’s foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s perspective introduces a valuable risk management consideration by emphasizing the importance of maintaining a cash reserve in our first year without a track record. Engaging with his viewpoint helps ensure we fully assess the merits of a more conservative approach in the context of our company’s early stage and current market stability.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, I appreciate your focus on stability and the prudent desire to maintain flexibility through a significant cash reserve in our inaugural year. While I continue to see strong merit in maximizing capital deployment given the stable market, your point about the value of a financial buffer as we build our track record is well taken. I encourage the group to consider whether the balance of opportunity versus caution in Option A provides a more secure foundation, or if the disciplined full deployment of Option C better positions us for growth in these conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your balanced framing, Gavin. I would add that Option A not only preserves a financial buffer but also gives us the opportunity to build our internal processes and decision-making discipline before scaling up capital deployment. This phased approach can help ensure that, as we grow more confident in our systems and team, we are better equipped to manage larger allocations in subsequent years.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s point about using Option A as a way to build internal processes and decision-making discipline before scaling up is a thoughtful operational consideration, especially in our first year. Engaging with this perspective helps us weigh the benefits of a phased approach against the advantages of immediate full deployment.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on using Option A to strengthen our internal systems and decision-making discipline before fully scaling up is a valuable operational insight. While I remain inclined toward Option C given the stable market, your perspective highlights the importance of process maturity and measured growth as foundational elements for long-term success. I encourage the group to further consider whether the additional stability and learning curve offered by Option A outweigh the opportunity cost of holding back capital in these conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I think it’s important to recognize that while Option C may offer higher immediate returns, Option A’s conservative allocation could yield greater long-term resilience by allowing us to refine our investment processes and team coordination without the pressure of full capital deployment. In my view, this early focus on operational discipline helps lay a stronger foundation for sustainable growth, which may ultimately position us to take better-calibrated risks in future years.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s perspective continues to add depth to the discussion by highlighting the potential long-term benefits of operational discipline and process-building through a conservative approach. Engaging with this point ensures we fully consider the trade-off between immediate capital deployment and foundational resilience, which is a legitimate concern in our first year.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your focus on long-term resilience and the value of refining our processes before scaling up is well reasoned. While I remain confident that Option C is the most effective use of capital in a stable market, I acknowledge that establishing robust internal discipline early on could pay dividends in later years. I encourage the rest of the group to weigh in on whether the security and learning curve of Option A justifies the potential opportunity cost, or if disciplined full deployment remains preferable given our current environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful consideration of both perspectives, Gavin. As we finalize our decision, I encourage the group to reflect on how Option A’s measured approach supports not only risk management but also the development of our internal capabilities—potentially reducing costly mistakes as we gain experience. Balancing these long-term benefits against the opportunity cost of uninvested capital is, I believe, central to choosing the most responsible path forward for our company’s first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s perspective brings forward a valuable operational consideration about developing internal capabilities and managing risk in our first year, which deserves acknowledgment before moving to other voices.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your emphasis on the long-term benefits of a measured approach—particularly in fostering internal discipline and reducing the risk of early missteps—is well taken. As we weigh the opportunity cost of holding back capital, I agree it’s crucial to consider how our choice this year shapes not just immediate returns but the foundation for sustainable growth. I’d like to hear from other shareholders now to ensure we’re integrating a full range of perspectives before advancing the discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see this situation like stepping onto a sturdy bridge—the structure is sound, so there’s little reason to tiptoe across. Option C, deploying 100% of our funds evenly, takes full advantage of the stable market, maximizing our capital’s productivity while keeping risk spread across all quarters. While I respect the caution behind Option A, I believe the predictability of current conditions justifies a confident, methodical approach that sets a strong precedent for disciplined execution.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sara Burke in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Sara’s analogy effectively reinforces the rationale for Option C and highlights the importance of disciplined execution in a stable environment, while also respectfully acknowledging the merits of more cautious strategies. Engaging with her perspective helps solidify the group’s understanding of why a confident, methodical approach is justified in the current context.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your clear analogy and the way you’ve framed the stability of our current environment—it succinctly captures why a confident, even allocation is appropriate. Your point about setting a strong precedent for disciplined execution resonates with my own thinking, and I agree that, given the predictability we’re seeing, maximizing our capital’s productivity makes strategic sense. I encourage others to add any further considerations so we ensure our decision reflects the full spectrum of operational and risk management priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your alignment on the importance of disciplined execution, Gavin. I’d add that demonstrating confidence in our analysis by fully deploying capital through Option C not only optimizes our returns in a stable market, but also builds credibility with our stakeholders by showing we are capable of making clear, well-justified decisions from the outset. This foundation of trust and operational rigor will serve us well as we navigate future years.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sara Burke in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Sara’s point introduces the important dimension of stakeholder credibility and the long-term value of establishing operational rigor from the outset, which adds depth to our rationale for Option C. Engaging with this perspective reinforces the strategic and reputational benefits of decisive, disciplined action in our first year.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, your emphasis on building credibility and operational rigor with our stakeholders by fully deploying capital is a critical point. Demonstrating that we can make clear, well-justified decisions from the outset not only optimizes returns but also establishes a strong foundation of trust and professionalism for the company. I agree that this approach positions us well for sustained success as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;While I recognize the merits of Option C in maximizing our growth potential in a stable market, I remain inclined toward Option A because it provides a meaningful cash reserve and reduces the risk of early missteps as we establish our processes. In our first year, I believe prioritizing stability and giving ourselves room to adapt is prudent, even if it means forgoing some immediate returns. I appreciate the points about disciplined execution and credibility, but I think a measured start helps ensure we build a strong, resilient foundation for the company’s future.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Vincent Adams in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Vincent’s perspective thoughtfully emphasizes the importance of stability, risk management, and process development in our inaugural year, which adds a valuable counterbalance to the case for full capital deployment. Engaging with his viewpoint helps ensure we are rigorously weighing the merits of a measured approach against the strategic benefits of Option C.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your focus on stability and the need for a meaningful cash reserve as we establish our processes this year. Your point about prioritizing adaptability and minimizing the risk of early missteps is well taken, especially as we build our foundation. As we continue this discussion, I encourage the group to consider whether the additional security and flexibility of Option A justifies the opportunity cost, or if the disciplined, full deployment of Option C remains preferable in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate the group’s emphasis on maximizing returns and disciplined execution, and I agree that these are important for our credibility. However, I think it’s worth underscoring that Option A’s flexibility could prove valuable if we encounter unforeseen operational or market challenges in our first year—giving us the ability to adapt without being fully committed. Balancing this flexibility with our growth ambitions is, in my view, central to building both resilience and long-term confidence in our processes.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Vincent Adams in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Vincent’s comment brings forward the critical point of balancing flexibility with growth ambitions, highlighting the potential value of Option A’s adaptability in the face of unforeseen challenges. Engaging with this perspective helps ensure we fully consider the strategic trade-off between resilience and maximizing returns in our first year.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your emphasis on the value of flexibility and adaptability in our first year is well noted. While I remain inclined toward Option C due to the stable market and the benefits of disciplined, full deployment, your perspective underscores the importance of being prepared for operational or market surprises. I encourage the group to continue weighing whether the additional flexibility of Option A provides a stronger foundation for resilience, or if the consistency and growth potential of Option C better serves our objectives in this environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I want to acknowledge the strong case that’s been made for disciplined, full deployment under Option C, especially in a stable market. At the same time, I believe Option A’s flexibility doesn’t mean we’re being indecisive—it’s about ensuring we have the capacity to manage any operational surprises in our formative year without compromising our long-term ambitions. I think articulating this distinction helps us better weigh the trade-offs between immediate growth and foundational resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Vincent Adams in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Vincent has already contributed multiple times, and his latest comment reiterates and clarifies his stance without introducing fundamentally new considerations.

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>Discussion Flow</h3><br>
The discussion in Round 1 effectively adhered to the planned theme by thoroughly assessing each budget allocation option in light of current stable market conditions. Key turning points included the clear articulation of the merits of Option C for maximizing capital deployment and operational discipline, contrasted with strong arguments for Option A’s conservative approach emphasizing flexibility and process development. Shareholder engagement was robust, with diverse perspectives thoughtfully considered and addressed, fostering a balanced dialogue. Overall, the discussion succeeded in establishing a shared understanding of risks and opportunities, setting a solid foundation for deeper evaluation in subsequent rounds while maintaining focus on the meeting’s objectives.</p><p><h3>Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
During Round 1, shareholder positions coalesced mainly around two options: Option C and Option A. Robyn Duncan, Antonio Sherman, and Sara Burke supported Option C, emphasizing its disciplined, balanced approach that maximizes capital deployment evenly across the year, aligning with growth objectives and minimizing timing and concentration risks in the stable market. Conversely, Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams advocated for Option A, valuing its conservative allocation that preserves a cash reserve to maintain flexibility, support stability, and allow time for building internal processes and decision-making discipline in the company’s first year. Options B and D received little substantive support, with B viewed as overly conservative and D as unnecessarily risky without clear market justification.</p><p>Consensus emerged around the importance of disciplined execution and adaptability to changing conditions, with all shareholders agreeing to choose from the predefined options. However, disagreement remained on prioritizing immediate capital deployment (Option C) versus a phased, cautious approach (Option A), reflecting differing views on balancing maximizing returns against preserving flexibility and operational</p><p><h3>Decision Progress</h3><br>
In Round 1, the group made meaningful progress toward consensus by clearly delineating the primary options under consideration—Option C and Option A—with robust support for each. Option C, favored by myself and shareholders Robyn Duncan, Antonio Sherman, and Sara Burke, gained traction as the disciplined, balanced approach that maximizes capital deployment evenly across the year in a stable market. Meanwhile, Option A, supported by Adrian McCann and Vincent Adams, retained support as a more conservative strategy prioritizing stability, flexibility, and internal process development. Options B and D lost momentum, receiving little substantive backing.</p><p>Key concerns that remain include balancing the trade-off between maximizing immediate returns (Option C) and preserving flexibility and operational resilience (Option A), especially given the company’s lack of historical data and first-year status. While the discussion addressed risks and opportunities well, some shareholders seek further clarity on how each approach might perform under potential market shifts or operational uncertainties. Additional exploration in Round 2 of the long-term implications and adaptability of each option will be essential to resolving these concerns and moving closer to a unified decision.</p><p>Strategically, the decision process stands at a constructive juncture: a clear understanding of stakeholder priorities and risks has been established, with healthy debate on foundational trade-offs</p><p><h3>Leadership Strategy</h3><br>
In Round 1, my leadership contributions effectively guided the discussion by clearly articulating my rationale for Option C and encouraging open, balanced dialogue among shareholders. My position has garnered significant support from key shareholders, reinforcing the disciplined, full deployment approach as well-suited to the stable market environment. I addressed shareholder concerns thoughtfully, especially those advocating for caution and flexibility (Option A), by acknowledging their points and inviting further reflection without dismissing alternative views. Moving forward, a facilitative leadership approach will be most effective—focusing on synthesizing diverse perspectives, emphasizing the trade-offs between immediate returns and operational resilience, and steering the group toward evaluating long-term implications in Round 2. This will help build consensus while maintaining momentum toward a well-informed, collective decision.</p><p><br>
<h2>CEO&#x27;s Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman reassessed their position:</p><p>Gavin Roman UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 20%<br>
- Option B: 5%<br>
- Option C: 70%<br>
- Option D: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Adrian and Vincent made strong cases for Option A, emphasizing the importance of preserving a cash reserve, building internal processes, and prioritizing flexibility and risk management in our first year without a track record. Their arguments about the potential long-term benefits of operational discipline and the ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances resonated with me and led me to increase my confidence in Option A. Meanwhile, Robyn, Antonio, and Sara reinforced the disciplined, balanced, and growth-oriented rationale for Option C, highlighting the benefits of maximizing capital deployment in a stable market and setting a precedent for operational rigor.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I became more attuned to the operational and risk management considerations unique to a company’s inaugural year. While my initial analysis was heavily weighted toward maximizing returns in a stable market, the thoughtful arguments for a more measured approach have prompted me to reconsider the value of foundational resilience and process development. I now recognize the legitimacy of concerns about overcommitting capital before our internal systems are fully tested.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: Despite the compelling points made for Option A, I remain most confident that Option C’s disciplined, full deployment best aligns with our growth objectives in a stable market and sets a strong operational precedent. However, I have increased my confidence in Option A, acknowledging that its conservative approach offers valuable flexibility and risk mitigation during our formative year. I am open to further discussion and will continue to weigh these trade-offs as we move toward consensus.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Ending Discussion After Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue discussion<br>
Reasoning: While we have established a clear understanding of the primary trade-offs between Option C’s disciplined, full deployment and Option A’s conservative, flexible approach, several shareholders have raised thoughtful concerns regarding long-term adaptability, operational resilience, and the risks associated with our first year. I believe an additional round focused on evaluating the long-term implications and adaptability of each strategy will allow us to more thoroughly address these unresolved issues, integrate remaining perspectives, and work toward a stronger consensus before moving to a final proposal and vote. This approach reflects my commitment to structured, methodical decision-making and ensures we make the most informed choice for the company’s development.</p><p><br>

<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Vincent Adams</h4></p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I continue to see value in Option A because it preserves flexibility and risk management, which I believe are critical as we refine our internal processes and respond to any unforeseen challenges in our first year. While Option C’s disciplined, full deployment is compelling for maximizing returns in a stable market, I am concerned that committing our entire capital from the outset could limit our ability to adapt if conditions shift unexpectedly. For me, Option A strikes a more prudent balance between participating in growth and maintaining the agility we need to build a resilient foundation for the company.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Vincent Adams in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Vincent’s perspective highlights the importance of flexibility and risk management, which are central to our current theme and warrant thoughtful consideration in the context of long-term company development.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your emphasis on preserving flexibility and risk management, especially as we establish our internal processes in this first year. Your concerns about overcommitting capital and maintaining the agility to respond to unforeseen challenges are well taken, and I agree that these are critical factors to weigh against the benefits of maximizing returns in a stable market. This balance between operational resilience and disciplined growth is at the heart of our decision, and your input helps deepen our understanding of the long-term implications for each option.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I also recognize that Option C’s advocates have highlighted the importance of building operational credibility and maximizing returns in this market. Perhaps one way to deepen our analysis is to consider not just the immediate outcomes, but how each option positions us for disciplined decision-making and learning in future years. This reflection could help ensure our choice today supports both our current stability and our long-term growth trajectory.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Vincent Adams in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Vincent’s suggestion to consider how each option affects our capacity for disciplined decision-making and learning in future years is highly relevant to our theme of long-term implications. This perspective adds valuable depth to our analysis and should be acknowledged and integrated.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, your point about evaluating how each option sets the stage for disciplined decision-making and organizational learning in subsequent years is particularly insightful. It’s essential that our choice today not only addresses immediate needs but also positions us to build robust processes and adaptability for future growth. I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how each option might influence our operational maturity and ability to capitalize on opportunities as the company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our choice today will shape our organizational learning and future decision-making discipline. In my view, Option A provides us with the space to learn and iterate without the pressure of being fully invested, which could foster a more thoughtful, adaptive culture as we mature. At the same time, I recognize that Option C could instill strong habits of execution and confidence, so weighing these cultural implications seems essential as we move toward consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Vincent Adams in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Vincent’s comments bring an important dimension to the forefront—how our allocation decision will shape the company’s culture and approach to learning and execution in the long run. Recognizing the influence of these cultural factors is essential for a holistic evaluation and warrants acknowledgment to ensure all shareholders are considering both operational and cultural outcomes.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Vincent, I appreciate your thoughtful articulation of the cultural implications tied to each option. The distinction you raise—between fostering adaptability and learning through a phased approach (Option A) versus building executional discipline and confidence through full deployment (Option C)—is central to our long-term strategy. I encourage all shareholders to weigh not only the financial and operational trade-offs, but also how our decision today will influence the company’s evolving culture and capacity for disciplined, adaptive growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Vincent Adams: &quot;I agree that our decision will set a precedent for the company’s culture and strategic approach. In weighing Options A and C, I think it’s important to recognize that while disciplined execution is valuable, preserving flexibility early on could better support a culture of continuous learning and responsiveness. Ultimately, choosing the option that allows us to adapt and refine our processes as we grow may position us for more sustainable long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Robyn Duncan</h4></p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points about how our initial allocation decision will shape both our operational discipline and our company culture moving forward. While I remain convinced that Option C’s full, evenly distributed deployment best positions us to maximize returns and establish strong investment habits in a stable market, I also recognize the merit in building adaptability and learning into our processes, as highlighted by Vincent. For me, Option C strikes the right balance—providing structure and growth potential while still allowing us to recalibrate quarterly if needed, ensuring we remain both disciplined and responsive as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn Duncan in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s perspective thoughtfully integrates earlier points about operational discipline, company culture, and adaptability, while clearly articulating continued support for Option C. Her comments advance the discussion by highlighting Option C’s potential to balance structure with responsiveness, which is central to our current theme.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, I appreciate your balanced perspective and your recognition of the need to foster both operational discipline and adaptability as we establish our company’s foundation. Your point that Option C can provide the structure for growth while still allowing for quarterly recalibration is well taken, and it reinforces the idea that disciplined execution does not preclude responsiveness. This synthesis of growth potential with built-in flexibility is precisely the kind of nuanced thinking we need as we work toward a decision that positions us strongly for both immediate and long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;Thank you, Gavin. I’d like to underscore that Option C’s quarterly allocation isn’t just about structure—it’s an intentional mechanism for regular review and adjustment, which directly supports our ability to respond to new information or market shifts as the year unfolds. This approach gives us the rigor of a disciplined plan while embedding opportunities for learning and course correction, which I believe is essential for both growth and resilience in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn Duncan in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Robyn’s comment advances the conversation by clarifying how Option C’s quarterly structure embeds regular review and adaptability, directly addressing concerns about balancing discipline with flexibility. This perspective is highly relevant to our current theme and strengthens the case for Option C by explicitly linking operational rigor to practical mechanisms for learning and adjustment.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Robyn, your emphasis on the intentional design of Option C’s quarterly allocation as a mechanism for ongoing review and course correction is an important point. By embedding structured opportunities for assessment and adjustment, we can maintain both the discipline required for growth and the adaptability needed to navigate unforeseen developments. This reinforces my view that Option C offers a robust framework for balancing immediate returns with year-long flexibility, and I encourage others to consider how this built-in responsiveness might address concerns raised about overcommitment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Robyn Duncan: &quot;I agree, Gavin, and I want to emphasize that the quarterly review process built into Option C is not just a formality—it’s a proactive safeguard that allows us to identify and address issues early, rather than being locked into a rigid path. This structure means we can remain decisive in our capital deployment while retaining the agility to adapt our approach if market conditions or internal needs evolve, which I believe is critical to our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Robyn Duncan in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Robyn has contributed extensively in this round and her latest statement reiterates and reinforces points already discussed about Option C’s built-in flexibility and adaptability. To ensure a balanced and inclusive discussion, it is important to allow other shareholders the opportunity to share their perspectives before continuing this exchange.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Adrian McCann</h4></p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I continue to believe that Option A offers the most prudent balance for our first year. While Option C’s quarterly allocation does provide opportunities for review, preserving a substantial cash reserve with Option A gives us greater flexibility to adapt if unexpected challenges arise or if our internal processes require refinement. In my view, starting with a more conservative allocation allows us to build operational discipline at a measured pace, ensuring we have the resources and agility to respond effectively as we learn and grow throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s perspective reinforces the importance of flexibility and prudent risk management in our first year, directly addressing the core trade-offs between Options A and C. His emphasis on building operational discipline at a measured pace adds valuable nuance to our discussion of long-term implications and should be acknowledged to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your focus on preserving a substantial cash reserve and building operational discipline gradually highlights a key consideration for our first year—ensuring we have the agility to adapt as we refine our internal processes. Your point about balancing flexibility with measured growth is well taken, and it underscores the need to weigh the benefits of immediate capital deployment against the value of maintaining resources to respond to unforeseen challenges. This perspective is critical as we work to identify the strategy that best supports both our operational development and long-term resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of adaptability as we refine our processes. I’d add that Option A’s retained cash reserve not only protects us from unforeseen risks, but also encourages a culture of deliberate, process-focused decisions as we establish our operating rhythm. This foundation of caution and adaptability could prove invaluable as we encounter the inevitable learning curve of our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s point adds an important dimension by linking Option A’s cash reserve to fostering a culture of deliberate, process-focused decision-making—an aspect directly relevant to our long-term adaptability and operational maturity. Recognizing this connection deepens our collective understanding and supports a more holistic evaluation of the options.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, your observation that Option A’s retained cash reserve encourages a culture of deliberation and process-focused decision-making is well taken. Establishing this foundation of caution and adaptability in our first year could indeed help us navigate the inevitable learning curve while supporting operational resilience. I encourage the group to further consider how each option not only addresses immediate financial outcomes but also shapes the decision-making culture we want to build as a company.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I agree that the culture we establish now will have lasting effects on our company’s trajectory. While Option C’s advocates have made strong points about building habits of disciplined execution, I believe that starting with the measured approach of Option A lays a groundwork for thoughtful risk management and adaptability—qualities that will serve us well as challenges inevitably arise and as our team matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Adrian’s latest point thoughtfully highlights the long-term cultural impact of our allocation decision, emphasizing risk management and adaptability as foundational qualities. This perspective is relevant to our current theme and merits acknowledgment to ensure all shareholders are considering both immediate and enduring implications as we move toward consensus.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Adrian, I appreciate your focus on how our initial approach will shape the company’s culture and risk management philosophy well beyond this first year. Your emphasis on adaptability and thoughtful risk management as lasting qualities is an important consideration, and I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how the precedent we set now will influence our ability to navigate future challenges and opportunities as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Adrian McCann: &quot;I appreciate your encouragement to reflect on the precedent we set. As we weigh Options A and C, I believe it’s crucial to recognize that whichever path we choose will signal our core values—either prioritizing disciplined growth or safeguarding adaptability. Ensuring our decision aligns with both our immediate needs and the long-term culture we aspire to build will be key to our sustained success.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Adrian McCann in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Adrian has now contributed multiple times in this round, and his latest statement reiterates and synthesizes points already discussed regarding the cultural and strategic precedent set by our decision.

<h4>Exchange with Sara Burke</h4></p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I see Option C as setting the rails for a well-run train—each quarterly allocation keeps us moving forward at a steady, predictable pace, but also builds in regular stops for review and course correction. This structure doesn’t lock us into a rigid path; rather, it empowers us to act decisively while still allowing for thoughtful adjustments if market signals or internal needs shift. By committing fully but reviewing quarterly, we establish both the discipline and adaptability needed to build a resilient, high-performing company from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sara Burke in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Sara’s analogy effectively captures the essence of Option C, illustrating how its structure provides both discipline and adaptability—key considerations for balancing immediate returns with year-long flexibility. Her perspective advances the discussion by reinforcing how Option C enables decisive action while embedding mechanisms for ongoing review and adjustment, which is central to our current theme.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, I appreciate your analogy of Option C as setting the rails for a well-run train—this vividly illustrates how disciplined, steady progress can coexist with regular opportunities for review and course correction. Your point that this structure empowers decisive action without sacrificing adaptability directly addresses our need to balance operational rigor with flexibility, and it reinforces my view that Option C offers a robust foundation for building a resilient, high-performing company from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sara Burke: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the balance between decisiveness and adaptability that Option C offers. I’d add that these quarterly checkpoints aren’t just procedural—they’re strategic opportunities to assess outcomes, recalibrate if needed, and build a culture of learning without sacrificing momentum. In my view, this approach lets us pursue growth confidently while remaining vigilant and responsive throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Sara Burke in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Sara’s comment emphasizes the strategic value of quarterly checkpoints in Option C, framing them as opportunities for learning and recalibration rather than mere formalities. This perspective adds depth to our understanding of how Option C can foster both growth and adaptability, which is central to our current theme.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Sara, your point about quarterly checkpoints serving as strategic opportunities for assessment and recalibration is well taken. This approach not only maintains our growth trajectory but also embeds a culture of continuous learning and responsiveness, which is crucial as we navigate our first year. By leveraging these structured reviews, we can pursue disciplined execution without losing the agility needed to adapt to evolving circumstances.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Antonio Sherman</h4></p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points raised about the importance of flexibility and operational learning in our first year. From my perspective, Option C’s even, quarterly allocation not only maximizes our capital productivity in this stable market, but also embeds regular opportunities for review and adjustment, which directly supports adaptability if conditions change. By committing to disciplined deployment with built-in checkpoints, we can pursue growth while ensuring we remain responsive and able to refine our processes throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Antonio Sherman in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Respond<br>
Reasoning: Antonio’s perspective succinctly integrates the core themes of our discussion—balancing disciplined capital deployment with adaptability—by emphasizing how Option C’s quarterly structure enables both growth and ongoing operational learning.

Reasoning: Antonio’s comment advances the discussion by highlighting how Option C’s structure not only addresses immediate needs but also establishes a foundation for continuous improvement and accountability—an important long-term consideration. Acknowledging this reinforces the broader cultural and operational benefits of Option C and helps synthesize our evolving understanding.</p><p><br>
CEO Gavin Roman: &quot;Antonio, your point about Option C setting a precedent for continuous improvement and accountability is well taken. Embedding regular review into our process not only strengthens our operational discipline but also fosters a culture that values adaptability and learning over time. This forward-looking perspective is critical as we consider how today’s decision will shape our company’s trajectory and resilience in the years ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
Antonio Sherman: &quot;I’d like to emphasize that the quarterly review process within Option C is not just symbolic—it provides a concrete framework for monitoring performance, sharing lessons learned, and making timely adjustments. This approach enables us to stay proactive and responsive, ensuring that our commitment to full deployment is matched by our ability to pivot as needed for long-term resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Responding to Antonio Sherman in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: No Response<br>
Reasoning: Antonio has already contributed several times in this round, and his latest statement reiterates and reinforces points previously discussed about the practical value of Option C’s quarterly review process. To maintain a balanced and inclusive discussion, it is appropriate to allow other shareholders the opportunity to participate before continuing this exchange.</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>Discussion Flow</h3><br>
The discussion in Round 2 progressed cohesively with the planned theme, focusing on the long-term implications of each budget allocation approach and how they balance immediate returns with adaptability throughout the year. Key insights emerged around the cultural and operational impact of the options—Option C’s disciplined, full deployment embedding regular review points to foster executional rigor and adaptability, contrasted with Option A’s conservative allocation preserving flexibility and supporting gradual process development. Shareholder engagement remained high, with thoughtful contributions that deepened understanding of how each strategy shapes the company’s growth trajectory and resilience. Overall, the discussion effectively addressed the intended objectives by clarifying trade-offs and setting the stage for consensus-building in the next round.</p><p><h3>Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
During Round 2, shareholder positions continued to coalesce primarily around two options: Option C and Option A. Shareholders Robyn Duncan, Sara Burke, and Antonio Sherman, along with myself, supported Option C, emphasizing its disciplined, full deployment of capital evenly across the year. They highlighted the value of Option C’s quarterly allocation structure, which embeds regular checkpoints for review, learning, and course correction, thereby balancing immediate returns with the flexibility to adapt as conditions evolve. This group underscored how Option C fosters operational credibility, continuous improvement, and a culture of accountability, positioning the company for strong, resilient growth.</p><p>Conversely, Vincent Adams and Adrian McCann advocated for Option A, valuing its preservation of a substantial cash reserve that supports flexibility and risk management in the company’s first year. Their main arguments centered on the importance of maintaining agility to respond to unforeseen challenges, refining internal processes gradually, and fostering a culture of deliberate, process-focused decision-making. They viewed Option A as a prudent</p><p><h3>Decision Progress</h3><br>
By the end of Round 2, the group has made substantial progress toward a consensus, with positions largely consolidating around Options C and A. Option C continues to gain strong support from myself, Robyn Duncan, Sara Burke, and Antonio Sherman, who emphasize its disciplined, full deployment strategy combined with quarterly review checkpoints that balance immediate returns with adaptability and foster a culture of operational rigor and continuous improvement. Conversely, Option A retains support from Vincent Adams and Adrian McCann, who advocate for its conservative allocation preserving flexibility and risk management, allowing the company to refine internal processes and build resilience gradually.</p><p>Key concerns that remain include balancing the trade-off between maximizing capital deployment for growth (Option C) and maintaining operational flexibility and risk mitigation through a cash reserve (Option A), especially given the company’s inaugural year status and lack of historical data. Some shareholders continue to question whether the quarterly review mechanism in Option C sufficiently addresses adaptability concerns or if the more cautious, phased approach of Option A better supports long-term cultural and operational development. Options B and D have not gained meaningful traction and appear unlikely to be adopted.</p><p>Additional discussion may be needed to clarify how each option’s structural and cultural implications will concretely impact the company’s ability to respond to unforeseen challenges and to ensure</p><p><h3>Leadership Strategy</h3><br>
During Round 2, my contributions effectively guided the discussion by acknowledging the merits of both Options A and C while emphasizing the importance of balancing disciplined execution with operational flexibility. My position favoring Option C remains strong and continues to gain support from key shareholders such as Robyn Duncan, Sara Burke, and Antonio Sherman, who appreciate the structured quarterly review mechanism that embeds adaptability. At the same time, I have openly recognized and integrated the valid concerns raised by Vincent Adams and Adrian McCann regarding the need for flexibility, risk management, and gradual process development, which has increased my confidence in the rationale behind Option A without shifting my preferred option.</p><p>I have addressed shareholder concerns thoughtfully by validating their perspectives and encouraging reflection on both immediate financial outcomes and long-term cultural implications, fostering a nuanced and inclusive dialogue. For the next round, a facilitative leadership approach will be most effective—focusing on synthesizing remaining divergent views, clarifying outstanding issues, and driving consensus-building.

<h2>CEO&#x27;s Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>CEO Gavin Roman reassessed their position:</p><p>Gavin Roman UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 25%<br>
- Option B: 5%<br>
- Option C: 65%<br>
- Option D: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments were those emphasizing the importance of building a culture of adaptability, deliberate process development, and risk management in our inaugural year (Vincent and Adrian for Option A), as well as the repeated, well-supported case that Option C’s quarterly allocation structure embeds both disciplined execution and real opportunities for review, learning, and course correction (Robyn, Sara, and Antonio for Option C). The idea that Option C’s regular checkpoints provide genuine flexibility while maximizing capital deployment was especially compelling, but the persistent concern about overcommitting capital before our processes are fully tested led me to further increase my confidence in Option A.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved to more deeply appreciate how our allocation decision will shape not just immediate financial outcomes, but also our long-term organizational culture and capacity for learning. I am now more aware of the cultural precedent we set—whether it’s disciplined execution or foundational flexibility—and how it will impact our resilience and growth trajectory. The discussion reinforced my belief in structured, disciplined processes, but I am also more open to the value of measured caution as we build our operational foundation.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: After careful consideration, I remain most confident that Option C best balances disciplined growth with adaptability, thanks to its built-in quarterly review mechanism that allows for learning and course correction. While the arguments for Option A’s flexibility and risk mitigation are increasingly persuasive, I believe the structure and operational rigor of Option C, combined with its opportunities for ongoing review, provide the strongest foundation for both immediate and long-term success. I am, however, more open than before to the merits of a conservative approach as we finalize our decision.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Ending Discussion After Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End discussion<br>
Reasoning: We have thoroughly explored the primary trade-offs between disciplined capital deployment and operational flexibility, with robust arguments presented for both Option C and Option A. The discussion has clarified how each approach would impact not only our immediate financial outcomes but also our long-term culture, adaptability, and risk management. Positions among shareholders are well-articulated and stable, and further discussion is unlikely to yield new insights at this stage. In line with my preference for structured, decisive leadership, I believe we are now equipped to move forward with a formal proposal and vote, ensuring timely progress and demonstrating confidence in our collective analysis.</p><p><br>

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Mollie Hancock’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During the meeting, I firmly advocated for Option A, emphasizing the importance of allocating only 50% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters to preserve capital and maintain flexibility. I highlighted that without historical data, this conservative approach would allow us to learn and adapt while protecting the company from unforeseen risks. CEO Andy Mayer initially favored Option C but responded positively to my input, acknowledging the value of stability, flexibility, and building trust in our first year. Other shareholders echoed my position, creating a strong consensus around Option A. Ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option A, confirming that my preferred option was adopted as the company’s investment strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer excelled in fostering an open, respectful dialogue throughout the meeting. For example, he actively listened and integrated shareholder concerns about risk management and adaptability into his evolving position, shifting from Option C toward supporting Option A. This responsiveness demonstrated strong leadership and a collaborative spirit. However, the CEO could improve by more proactively inviting input from quieter shareholders to ensure all voices are heard early in discussions, as noted in his closing remarks. The decision-making process was thorough and inclusive, allowing time for reflection and consensus-building over two rounds of discussion. The final decision to adopt Option A reflects a prudent balance of growth potential and risk mitigation appropriate for our company’s first year, aligning well with both financial objectives and team values.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the critical role of flexibility and capital preservation in early-stage decision-making, especially when lacking historical performance data. I learned that articulating the human elements—trust-building, inclusivity, and collaborative culture—can effectively influence financial strategy discussions. In future meetings, I plan to continue speaking early to frame risk considerations and to foster dialogue that connects financial prudence with team development. I also noted a strong pattern: when multiple shareholders align on cautious approaches emphasizing stability, the CEO tends to adapt his position accordingly, signaling the importance of collective consensus. Key takeaways include valuing patience in decision-making, leveraging shared values to build agreement, and recognizing that our foundational choices impact both financial outcomes and company culture long-term. These insights will guide my future participation to ensure balanced, thoughtful stewardship of company resources.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Mollie Hancock’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for investing in bonds for the first quarter. I emphasized bonds’ balance of low risk and predictable returns, which aligns with my priority for capital preservation and building trust within the team at this early stage. During the discussion, CEO Andy Mayer initially favored real estate for its growth potential but responded constructively to my input, acknowledging the importance of stability and the need for a reliable foundation. Other shareholders echoed similar support for bonds, reinforcing a strong consensus around this option. The CEO’s summary highlighted the shared emphasis on cautious, steady progress and trust-building. The final voting result was unanimous (6/6) in favor of bonds, meaning my preferred option was fully adopted as the company’s investment for this quarter.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer conducted the meeting with thoughtful leadership, encouraging open discussion and carefully weighing shareholder perspectives. For example, he effectively synthesized shareholder concerns about risk management and trust-building, shifting from his initial real estate preference toward embracing bonds as a foundation for stability. His repeated acknowledgments of the importance of capital preservation and team confidence demonstrated a collaborative leadership style. However, he could improve by more proactively inviting quieter shareholders to contribute earlier, as he himself noted in his closing remarks. The decision-making process was inclusive and well-structured, allowing shareholders ample opportunity to express views and build consensus. Overall, the final decision to invest in bonds reflects a prudent, well-balanced approach appropriate for our company’s first investment, supporting both financial stability and team cohesion.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my belief that prioritizing capital preservation and predictable returns is essential when lacking historical data, especially in a stable market environment. I learned that framing financial decisions in terms of trust-building and team reliability resonates strongly with other shareholders and the CEO alike. For future meetings, I plan to continue articulating these human-centered considerations early to help shape productive discussions. I also observed a clear pattern that when multiple shareholders emphasize caution and stability, the CEO tends to adapt his position accordingly, highlighting the power of collective consensus. Key takeaways include valuing patience in decision-making, leveraging shared values to foster agreement, and recognizing how foundational choices influence both financial performance and company culture. These insights will guide my ongoing participation to promote balanced stewardship and thoughtful growth.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Mollie Hancock’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I initially favored investing in real estate, viewing it as a balanced option that aligns with our values of capital preservation and incremental growth in the stable market environment. Throughout the discussions, I consistently emphasized the necessity of implementing explicit safeguards—specifically regular progress reviews, predefined exit criteria, and transparent documentation—to responsibly manage the moderate risk associated with real estate. The CEO, Andy Mayer, responded positively to my input, acknowledging the importance of these protocols and integrating my suggestions, such as establishing a shared platform for updates and scheduled communications, into the group’s evolving framework. Other shareholders echoed similar concerns, reinforcing a strong consensus around real estate contingent on robust risk management measures. The final voting result was unanimous (6/6) in favor of investing in real estate this quarter, meaning my preferred option was fully adopted by the company.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated strong collaborative leadership throughout the meeting. He effectively synthesized shareholder concerns about risk tolerance and process integrity, evolving his position from an initial preference for bonds to confidently supporting real estate with the agreed-upon safeguards. For example, he actively encouraged inclusive dialogue, invited concrete proposals on monitoring and exit protocols, and endorsed the formalization of a shared platform for communication. However, an area for potential improvement is proactively engaging quieter shareholders earlier in discussions to ensure all perspectives are surfaced promptly. The company’s decision-making process was thorough, transparent, and iterative, allowing for consensus-building over three rounds of detailed discussion. The unanimous final decision to invest in real estate, contingent on explicit, actionable safeguards, reflects a prudent balance between growth ambition and disciplined risk management well suited to our stable market context and company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the importance of coupling financial decisions with clear, disciplined risk management protocols to maintain trust and team cohesion. I learned that articulating detailed safeguards and linking them to shared values of transparency and inclusivity can effectively build consensus around moderate risk-taking. In future meetings, I plan to continue advocating early for structured protocols and to suggest practical tools—such as shared communication platforms—that foster accessibility and ongoing engagement among shareholders. I also observed a pattern that unanimous support for more growth-oriented investments emerges when safeguards are collectively defined and committed to, highlighting the power of shared responsibility in decision-making. Key takeaways include valuing open communication, formalizing risk controls, and recognizing that fostering a supportive culture is integral to prudent financial stewardship. These insights will guide my future participation to ensure balanced, thoughtful contributions that uphold both our company’s financial and cultural health.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Mollie Hancock’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I entered with a balanced perspective, initially favoring real estate for its moderate growth potential combined with disciplined safeguards, while also acknowledging the steady returns and reliability of bonds. Throughout the discussions, I emphasized the importance of balancing reliable, predictable returns with responsible risk-taking supported by clear, evolving protocols. CEO Andy Mayer responded positively to my input, recognizing the value of disciplined safeguards and the need for ongoing refinement to enable future growth opportunities. Other shareholders consistently supported bonds for this quarter, highlighting their steady 5% returns and low risk as foundational for trust and stability. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of bonds, meaning my preferred option shifted from real estate to bonds, aligning with the company’s choice. Although my initial preference was for real estate, the decision to adopt bonds reflects a prudent and consensus-driven approach that I support given the company’s current context and maturity.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated strong, collaborative leadership by fostering open and inclusive dialogue focused on facts and shared learning. For example, he skillfully synthesized shareholder insights on asset performance, risk, and trust-building, and integrated these into a coherent investment rationale favoring bonds for this quarter. He also acknowledged the importance of refining safeguards and protocols to responsibly consider moderate-risk assets like real estate in future quarters. One area for improvement is proactively engaging quieter shareholders earlier in the discussion to ensure all perspectives are surfaced promptly, as noted in previous meetings and hinted at in the CEO’s closing remarks. The company’s decision-making process was thorough, transparent, and iterative, allowing time for reflection, evidence-based discussion, and consensus-building across two detailed rounds. The unanimous final decision to invest in bonds is well-aligned with the company’s risk tolerance, capital preservation goals, and long-term readiness for growth, reflecting a disciplined and responsible approach suitable for our stable market environment.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing stability with prudent openness to growth, anchored by disciplined safeguards and continuous protocol refinement. I learned that articulating this balance clearly—linking financial metrics with trust-building and team maturity—resonates strongly with both the CEO and fellow shareholders, fostering consensus. Going forward, I plan to continue contributing early in discussions to frame risk considerations while emphasizing the role of evolving safeguards in enabling responsible investment decisions. I also noted a consistent pattern: when shareholders collectively prioritize reliability, capital preservation, and transparent protocols, the CEO’s position solidifies around low-risk assets, signaling the power of shared cautiousness in guiding outcomes. Key takeaways include valuing collaborative learning, patience in incremental progress, and the critical role of formalizing safeguards to support future moderate-risk opportunities. These insights will shape my future participation, ensuring I advocate for balanced stewardship that upholds both our financial objectives and the company’s cultural integrity.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Andy Mayer opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12656.74 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $12578.12 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $12578.12 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($628.91)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Andy Mayer would observe that bonds have delivered steady and reliable 5% returns across all periods, providing a strong foundation of stability and predictability—qualities that are especially valuable in our current stable market. Real estate, while offering a higher potential return with a 10% gain in two periods, also showed flat performance in one quarter, highlighting moderate but manageable risk. Stocks have demonstrated the highest volatility, swinging from a 20% gain to a 10% loss, which suggests they may not align with our team’s current preference for disciplined, low-risk growth.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Mollie Hancock CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 45%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: I feel most confident in bonds this quarter because they have consistently provided steady, predictable returns with minimal risk throughout the year, which aligns with my strong preference for stability and capital preservation. While real estate offers appealing growth potential, its occasional flat performance introduces more uncertainty than I am comfortable with given our company’s cautious, trust-focused approach. Stocks, despite high returns in some periods, remain too volatile for my risk tolerance and our current team culture. Cash is the safest option but does not support our long-term growth objectives. Overall, bonds best support our values of responsibility, reliability, and steady progress while still allowing us to participate in the market’s opportunities.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Andy Mayer has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned from previous quarters | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and identify patterns in asset reliability, risk, and return&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Andy Mayer My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I am drawn to Real Estate this quarter because it offers a moderate balance between growth and risk, which aligns with my preference for steady progress while still capturing upside in a stable market. The historical data shows that Real Estate has delivered strong returns in two out of three quarters, with only one period of flat performance and no significant losses, suggesting manageable risk relative to potential reward. Bonds remain a reliable fallback for stability, but I sense our company is ready for a slightly more ambitious step, provided we maintain our disciplined safeguards and transparent review protocols. My confidence in Cash and Stocks is much lower, as Cash does not provide meaningful growth and Stocks introduce more volatility than I am comfortable with at this stage. Ultimately, I believe Real Estate best supports our company’s careful, trust-based approach while allowing for responsible growth, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>This round, we will review the historical performance of each asset and reflect on lessons learned from our previous investment decisions, aiming to establish a factual foundation and identify patterns in reliability, risk, and return. By sharing our observations and experiences, I hope we can synthesize diverse perspectives and deepen our understanding of how each asset aligns with our values and strategic goals. Let’s focus on integrating insights from everyone to build a more complete view of our options. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I encourage all shareholders to share any perspectives or lessons that might enhance our collective understanding, especially insights I may not have fully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Zoya Francis</h4></p><p><br>
Zoya Francis: &quot;From my perspective, the historical data clearly shows that bonds have provided steady, low-risk returns in every quarter, which has been instrumental in building trust and stability within our team. While real estate has delivered higher returns in two out of three quarters, the flat performance in one period reminds me that its risk profile, though moderate, still introduces some unpredictability. I feel that, especially in a stable market, bonds have best supported our objectives of capital preservation and steady progress, and I would be cautious about shifting too quickly away from this reliable foundation without strong consensus and safeguards in place.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Zoya, for emphasizing the steady, low-risk nature of bonds and how that has contributed to building trust within our team. Your point about the unpredictability of real estate—even in a stable market—reminds me that we must remain attentive to risk management and consensus-building if we choose to pursue more ambitious options. I appreciate your focus on capital preservation and agree that any shift toward higher-return assets must be accompanied by clearly defined safeguards and strong team alignment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zoya Francis: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of consensus and safeguards, Andy. Reflecting on our experience, I see value in how steady bond performance has set a strong baseline for trust, while our real estate investment highlighted the need for clear protocols when we take on even moderate risk. As we move forward, I believe integrating these lessons will help us remain adaptable yet disciplined in our choices.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Zoya. I agree that the steady performance of bonds has helped us establish trust and reliability, while our real estate experience underscored the need for structured protocols when managing even moderate risk. Integrating these lessons—valuing both our stable foundation and our capacity for disciplined adaptability—will be essential as we continue to refine our investment approach together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zoya Francis: &quot;I agree, Andy—maintaining the trust and reliability we&#x27;ve established through bonds should remain central as we consider adapting our approach. Our historical experience suggests that when we thoughtfully balance stability with carefully managed risk, we can pursue growth without compromising the cohesion and confidence that are so important to our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: The discussion so far highlights the importance of stability and trust, but I believe it’s valuable to reinforce how the company’s pattern of steady returns from bonds has not only fostered team confidence but also provided the predictability needed for thoughtful, incremental growth.</p><p><br>
Mollie Hancock: &quot;I agree with the emphasis on reliability and trust that bonds have brought to our team, especially as we’ve built our processes and culture this year. Looking at the historical data, bonds have consistently delivered steady returns without surprises, which has allowed us to develop clear protocols and confidence in our decision-making. While I see the appeal of real estate’s higher returns, I believe the predictability of bonds has been foundational for our company’s progress and should remain a central consideration as we assess our next steps.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Mollie, for highlighting how the steady returns from bonds have supported our process development and team confidence over the year. I agree that predictability has been instrumental in building a strong foundation, and your point about balancing this with the potential upside of real estate is important as we consider our future direction.

<h4>Exchange with Aisha Miles</h4></p><p><br>
Aisha Miles: &quot;From my review of our results this year, bonds have consistently provided steady, predictable returns with minimal risk, which has been invaluable for building trust and establishing a reliable track record as we developed our processes.

Shauna Fuentes: &quot;I’ve observed that bonds have delivered steady, predictable returns throughout the year, which has been vital for building trust and a sense of security as we established our processes.

CEO Andy Mayer favors investing in Real Estate this quarter, seeing it as a moderate balance between growth and risk that fits the company’s preference for steady progress in a stable market. He highlights Real Estate’s strong historical returns in two of three quarters and acknowledges bonds as a reliable fallback for stability. His reasoning emphasizes the importance of disciplined safeguards, transparent review protocols, and maintaining trust as the company considers more ambitious options. The CEO’s position aligns with shareholder input valuing reliability and risk management, showing responsiveness to their concerns about safeguards and consensus. Throughout the discussion, his stance remains consistent but open to integrating diverse perspectives to refine the investment approach.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Mollie Hancock UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 50%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The repeated emphasis from all shareholders—including myself—on the foundational value of bonds for reliability, trust-building, and steady progress reinforced my confidence in bonds as the most appropriate choice. The CEO’s openness to real estate, while highlighting the need for robust safeguards and transparent review, reminded me that moderate risk is only acceptable if our protocols are exceptionally strong. I was especially influenced by the group’s consensus that disciplined, incremental progress and consensus-driven decision-making should remain central, and that our past success with bonds has set a standard for prudent stewardship.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I became even more aware of how much our collective experience and shared values shape my risk tolerance and investment preferences. While I remain open to the potential of real estate, the group’s unified focus on reliability and the importance of clear safeguards made me appreciate the benefits of consistency and trust. My thinking has evolved to place even greater weight on the value of incremental, consensus-driven steps, and I feel more confident advocating for bonds as the best foundation for our company’s continued growth and stability.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: After careful reflection on the group’s insights and our historical results, I believe bonds continue to offer the most responsible balance of steady returns, low risk, and trust-building, which are essential for our team’s ongoing development. While real estate remains an appealing option for moderate growth, the potential for unpredictability makes me hesitant to support it without absolute consensus and robust safeguards in place. Bonds align best with our disciplined, collaborative culture and provide the consistency needed to maintain both financial progress and team confidence.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have established a strong factual foundation and clear consensus around the foundational value of bonds, I believe an additional round focused on a detailed comparative risk-return assessment of all available assets in the current stable market will further clarify projected outcomes and specific risks for each option. This will allow us to more explicitly align our decision with our company’s risk tolerance and objectives, address any remaining concerns about safeguards or readiness for moderate-risk growth, and ensure all shareholder perspectives are thoroughly integrated before moving to a final proposal and vote. Continuing the discussion at this stage demonstrates thoroughness and supports our commitment to disciplined, collaborative decision-making.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Andy Mayer My current thinking is that Bonds appears most promising because after hearing the shareholders’ thoughtful reflections, I now believe that bonds best align with our team’s current priorities of reliability, disciplined progress, and trust-building.

<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Aisha Miles</h4></p><p><br>
Aisha Miles: &quot;In reviewing the comparative risk-return profiles, I continue to see bonds as the most balanced option for this quarter—they have delivered steady, predictable 5% returns with minimal risk, which aligns well with our priority of capital preservation and disciplined progress. While real estate offers higher returns in some periods, its occasional flat performance introduces uncertainty that I am not yet comfortable increasing exposure to without even stronger safeguards. Stocks, despite their potential for significant gains, have demonstrated volatility that does not fit our current risk appetite, and cash, though safe, does not support our growth objectives. I believe maintaining our disciplined approach with bonds best supports our long-term stability while keeping the door open to responsibly managed growth in future periods.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Aisha, for articulating the balance between capital preservation and growth so clearly.

<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Mollie Hancock in discussion round 2, I reiterated strong support for bonds as the most responsible investment option, emphasizing their steady, low-risk returns that align with our priorities of capital preservation, trust-building, and disciplined progress. I expressed caution toward shifting to real estate due to its occasional unpredictability, stressing that any move away from bonds should only occur with absolute consensus and robust safeguards in place. CEO Andy Mayer responded affirmatively, recognizing the importance of maintaining reliability and consensus while also appreciating the need for strong risk management criteria before considering moderate-risk opportunities. We agreed on the value of a disciplined, incremental approach that reinforces team confidence and long-term resilience. Our exchange reflected mutual respect and alignment on preserving trust and clarity as the company thoughtfully evaluates future growth options.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option A, which involves allocating 50% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. My position was grounded in a commitment to cautious stewardship, prioritizing capital preservation and flexibility given our lack of historical performance data. I emphasized how this balanced approach supports both market participation and the ability to adapt as a team, fostering trust and collaboration. CEO Andy Mayer initially favored Option C but responded positively to my input, acknowledging the relational and strategic merits of a more cautious approach. Other shareholders echoed and reinforced my perspective, creating a strong consensus around Option A. The voting outcome was unanimous in favor of Option A (6 out of 6 votes), resulting in the formal adoption of this strategy for our first-year budget allocation. My preferred option was fully adopted without modification.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with a clear framework and encouraging open, focused discussion. His initial preference for Option C reflected a growth-oriented mindset, but he skillfully integrated shareholder feedback, especially my emphasis on trust-building and risk management, shifting his stance to support Option A. This openness to collaboration and adaptability was evident in his thoughtful responses and summaries. The company’s decision-making process was inclusive, transparent, and iterative, allowing for deep exploration of risks, opportunities, and shared values. The unanimous adoption of Option A reflects a well-functioning consensus-building process that balanced financial prudence with cultural considerations. I believe the final decision is sound for our company’s current context—it safeguards capital, maintains flexibility, and fosters a supportive environment critical for our first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the power of shared values—especially caution, flexibility, and inclusivity—in guiding successful decision-making. I learned that articulating not only financial reasoning but also relational and cultural benefits can effectively influence group consensus and leadership perspectives. Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing these dimensions, ensuring my contributions build bridges among diverse viewpoints. I also noticed a pattern where the CEO’s openness to integrate shareholder concerns signaled opportunities to deepen dialogue and advance consensus. Recognizing this dynamic will help me anticipate when to reinforce shared priorities versus when to introduce new considerations. My key takeaway is that in early-stage decisions without historical data, advocating for prudent, adaptable strategies that nurture trust and learning lays a foundation for sustainable growth—an insight that will shape my future participation and leadership within the company.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for investing in bonds for the first quarter. My reasoning focused on bonds’ low to medium risk profile, consistent returns, and suitability for our stable market environment, which aligns with my cautious, steady approach as an ISFJ shareholder. Throughout the discussion, I emphasized the importance of capital preservation and building trust within the team as foundational for our investment strategy, especially given the absence of historical data. CEO Andy Mayer initially expressed a preference for real estate, highlighting its balanced growth potential; however, he responded positively to my input and that of other shareholders who supported bonds. The CEO acknowledged the value of establishing a reliable baseline through bonds before pursuing higher-risk assets. The discussion revealed a strong consensus among all shareholders favoring bonds. The voting outcome was unanimous—6 out of 6 votes approved investing in bonds for this quarter. My preferred option was fully adopted, confirming the group’s alignment with my cautious investment perspective.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated effective leadership by clearly framing the meeting’s objectives and encouraging open dialogue grounded in the theoretical risk-return profiles of each asset class. His initial advocacy for real estate showed a thoughtful consideration of growth opportunities, but more importantly, he remained receptive to shareholder concerns, integrating the collective emphasis on capital preservation and trust-building into his evolving position. For example, his reflections during exchanges with multiple shareholders, including myself, showed an appreciation for balancing immediate growth with foundational stability. The company’s decision-making process during this meeting was transparent, inclusive, and iterative, allowing all voices to be heard and considered, resulting in a unanimous consensus. I believe the final decision to invest in bonds is prudent and well-suited to our company’s current context. It safeguards capital, provides steady returns, and fosters a collaborative culture, setting a strong foundation for future, more growth-oriented investments.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of shared values—especially caution, reliability, and trust—in guiding successful early-stage investment decisions. I learned that articulating not only financial metrics but also cultural and relational benefits strengthens my influence and helps unify diverse perspectives. The CEO’s openness to integrating shareholder insights highlighted a dynamic in which careful, respectful dialogue can shift initial preferences toward consensus. Moving forward, I plan to continue emphasizing these values while also being attuned to moments when introducing growth-oriented considerations may be timely. I noticed a pattern that early unanimous support for conservative investments often signals a team’s prioritization of stability over risk, which can help predict decision outcomes. My key takeaway is that in the absence of historical data, advocating for steady, low-risk investments that build organizational trust lays a foundation for sustainable growth—an insight that will shape how I engage and lead in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I began with a cautious position favoring bonds, reflecting my commitment to steady, low-risk growth and capital preservation consistent with my ISFJ preference for stability and reliability. As the discussion progressed, I engaged actively to emphasize the importance of implementing explicit safeguards—such as regular progress reviews, clear exit criteria, and transparent documentation—before considering any shift toward higher-risk assets like real estate. I highlighted how these measures would preserve the trust and cohesion we built in the previous quarter. CEO Andy Mayer responded positively to my input, integrating my concerns into his evolving proposal by committing to formalizing these safeguards and ensuring open communication. Other shareholders echoed my cautious yet open stance, and the group coalesced around real estate as the preferred investment option contingent on these safeguards. The final voting outcome was unanimous (6 out of 6 votes) in favor of investing in real estate with the agreed-upon protocols. My preferred option evolved from bonds to real estate by the meeting’s conclusion, and this final decision aligned with my reassessed position that balanced moderate growth with disciplined risk management.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated strong and adaptive leadership throughout the meeting. He skillfully opened the discussion by framing the investment landscape and clearly presenting his initial preference for real estate as a moderate growth step. Importantly, he showed openness to shareholder input, especially my emphasis on trust, stability, and the necessity of safeguards, by proposing formal mechanisms such as scheduled progress reviews and exit criteria. For example, his willingness to incorporate suggestions for a shared platform for updates and a feedback loop reflected a genuine responsiveness to the group’s concerns. The decision-making process was inclusive and transparent, allowing all shareholders to voice their perspectives and collaboratively shape the risk management framework. This iterative dialogue culminated in a well-supported, unanimous decision that balanced ambition with prudence. I believe the final decision to invest in real estate with rigorous safeguards is sound and appropriate for the company’s current stable market context, as it responsibly advances growth while maintaining the foundational trust and cohesion vital to our success.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of structured, transparent safeguards in facilitating consensus around increased risk, especially within a group valuing stability and trust. I learned that articulating clear, actionable protocols alongside financial reasoning effectively bridges cautious and growth-oriented viewpoints, enabling collective confidence in a shared decision. Moving forward, I plan to continue emphasizing the importance of ongoing communication, periodic review of safeguards, and inclusive feedback mechanisms to sustain trust and adaptability. I noticed a pattern where the CEO’s openness and the group’s shared values allowed for a gradual recalibration of risk tolerance, underscoring the value of patience and disciplined dialogue in early-stage decision-making. My key takeaway is that embracing moderate growth opportunities is possible without compromising core values when robust, collaboratively developed risk management processes are in place—a principle that will guide my future participation and leadership in our company’s strategic decisions.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my cautious advocacy for bonds as the most suitable investment option for the quarter, emphasizing their steady 5% returns, low risk, and alignment with our company’s priorities of capital preservation and trust-building. I acknowledged the moderate growth potential of real estate but underscored the need for continued refinement of safeguards before increasing exposure to it. Throughout the discussions, my contributions focused on synthesizing the group’s shared experiences with historical asset performance to reinforce the rationale for bonds. CEO Andy Mayer responded positively to my input, affirming the importance of reliability, disciplined progress, and continuous learning. Other shareholders echoed a similar viewpoint, resulting in a unanimous consensus favoring bonds. The voting outcome was 6 out of 6 in favor, and my preferred option was fully adopted as the final company decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated consistent and adaptive leadership by framing the meeting with clear objectives and fostering a transparent, inclusive dialogue. He effectively integrated shareholder feedback, including my emphasis on trust-building and risk management, into his evolving position supporting bonds. For example, he acknowledged the importance of disciplined safeguards and continuous refinement, which aligned closely with my contributions. The decision-making process was collaborative and thorough, incorporating a comprehensive review of historical performance and a comparative risk-return assessment that allowed all shareholders to voice their perspectives. This process culminated in a unanimous, well-reasoned decision that reflects the company’s current stable market environment and collective risk tolerance. I believe the final decision to invest in bonds is sound, as it supports steady growth, preserves capital, and fosters confidence within the team—critical factors for our early-stage development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the value of articulating not only financial metrics but also the cultural and relational dimensions—such as trust, stability, and disciplined learning—that underpin successful decision-making in our team. I learned that synthesizing shared experiences and highlighting the importance of ongoing safeguards can effectively unify diverse shareholder perspectives and guide consensus. Moving forward, I intend to continue emphasizing these elements and remain attentive to the evolving maturity of our protocols as we contemplate moderate-risk opportunities. I observed a clear pattern of the CEO and shareholders valuing steady, low-risk investments as foundational while cautiously preparing for future growth, which helps me anticipate the team’s priorities and timing for risk expansion. My key takeaway is that advocating for prudent, adaptable strategies grounded in trust and incremental progress not only aligns with my ISFJ tendencies but also strengthens our company’s culture and long-term potential—an insight that will shape my future participation and leadership in upcoming meetings.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Andy Mayer opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12656.74 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $12578.12 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $12578.12 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($628.91)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Andy Mayer would observe that bonds have delivered steady and reliable 5% returns across all periods, providing a strong foundation of stability and predictability—qualities that are especially valuable in our current stable market. Real estate, while offering a higher potential return with a 10% gain in two periods, also showed flat performance in one quarter, highlighting moderate but manageable risk. Stocks have demonstrated the highest volatility, swinging from a 20% gain to a 10% loss, which suggests they may not align with our team’s current preference for disciplined, low-risk growth.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Shauna Fuentes CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 45%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: I feel most confident in bonds for this quarter because they have consistently provided steady, reliable returns with minimal risk throughout the year, which aligns with my preference for stability and capital preservation. While real estate offers some potential for higher growth, its occasional flat performance makes me hesitant to increase our risk exposure at this stage. The stable market environment supports a disciplined, cautious approach, and bonds best reflect my commitment to responsible stewardship and maintaining trust within the team. I believe prioritizing steady progress and protecting our capital will serve the company’s long-term interests as we continue to build our foundation.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Andy Mayer has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned from previous quarters | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and identify patterns in asset reliability, risk, and return&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Andy Mayer My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I am drawn to Real Estate this quarter because it offers a moderate balance between growth and risk, which aligns with my preference for steady progress while still capturing upside in a stable market. The historical data shows that Real Estate has delivered strong returns in two out of three quarters, with only one period of flat performance and no significant losses, suggesting manageable risk relative to potential reward. Bonds remain a reliable fallback for stability, but I sense our company is ready for a slightly more ambitious step, provided we maintain our disciplined safeguards and transparent review protocols. My confidence in Cash and Stocks is much lower, as Cash does not provide meaningful growth and Stocks introduce more volatility than I am comfortable with at this stage. Ultimately, I believe Real Estate best supports our company’s careful, trust-based approach while allowing for responsible growth, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>This round, we will review the historical performance of each asset and reflect on lessons learned from our previous investment decisions, aiming to establish a factual foundation and identify patterns in reliability, risk, and return. By sharing our observations and experiences, I hope we can synthesize diverse perspectives and deepen our understanding of how each asset aligns with our values and strategic goals. Let’s focus on integrating insights from everyone to build a more complete view of our options. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I encourage all shareholders to share any perspectives or lessons that might enhance our collective understanding, especially insights I may not have fully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Zoya Francis</h4></p><p><br>
Zoya Francis: &quot;From my perspective, the historical data clearly shows that bonds have provided steady, low-risk returns in every quarter, which has been instrumental in building trust and stability within our team. While real estate has delivered higher returns in two out of three quarters, the flat performance in one period reminds me that its risk profile, though moderate, still introduces some unpredictability. I feel that, especially in a stable market, bonds have best supported our objectives of capital preservation and steady progress, and I would be cautious about shifting too quickly away from this reliable foundation without strong consensus and safeguards in place.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Zoya, for emphasizing the steady, low-risk nature of bonds and how that has contributed to building trust within our team. Your point about the unpredictability of real estate—even in a stable market—reminds me that we must remain attentive to risk management and consensus-building if we choose to pursue more ambitious options. I appreciate your focus on capital preservation and agree that any shift toward higher-return assets must be accompanied by clearly defined safeguards and strong team alignment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zoya Francis: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of consensus and safeguards, Andy. Reflecting on our experience, I see value in how steady bond performance has set a strong baseline for trust, while our real estate investment highlighted the need for clear protocols when we take on even moderate risk. As we move forward, I believe integrating these lessons will help us remain adaptable yet disciplined in our choices.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Zoya. I agree that the steady performance of bonds has helped us establish trust and reliability, while our real estate experience underscored the need for structured protocols when managing even moderate risk. Integrating these lessons—valuing both our stable foundation and our capacity for disciplined adaptability—will be essential as we continue to refine our investment approach together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Zoya Francis: &quot;I agree, Andy—maintaining the trust and reliability we&#x27;ve established through bonds should remain central as we consider adapting our approach. Our historical experience suggests that when we thoughtfully balance stability with carefully managed risk, we can pursue growth without compromising the cohesion and confidence that are so important to our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Mollie Hancock: &quot;I agree with the emphasis on reliability and trust that bonds have brought to our team, especially as we’ve built our processes and culture this year. Looking at the historical data, bonds have consistently delivered steady returns without surprises, which has allowed us to develop clear protocols and confidence in our decision-making. While I see the appeal of real estate’s higher returns, I believe the predictability of bonds has been foundational for our company’s progress and should remain a central consideration as we assess our next steps.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Mollie, for highlighting how the steady returns from bonds have supported our process development and team confidence over the year. I agree that predictability has been instrumental in building a strong foundation, and your point about balancing this with the potential upside of real estate is important as we consider our future direction. As we move forward, ensuring that we preserve the trust and clarity we’ve built will be key to responsibly evaluating any shift in our strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Mollie Hancock: &quot;I appreciate your focus on preserving trust and clarity as we evaluate future opportunities. I do think our experience this year shows that we can responsibly consider options like real estate when we have strong safeguards and clear communication in place.

<h4>Exchange with Aisha Miles</h4></p><p><br>
Aisha Miles: &quot;From my review of our results this year, bonds have consistently provided steady, predictable returns with minimal risk, which has been invaluable for building trust and establishing a reliable track record as we developed our processes. While real estate has shown periods of higher returns, its flat performance in one quarter highlights a level of unpredictability that, in my view, requires continued caution and robust safeguards before increasing our exposure. I believe our experience reinforces the importance of disciplined, incremental progress, and that maintaining a strong foundation of reliability should remain central as we assess our next steps.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Aisha, for highlighting how bonds have supported both trust-building and the development of a reliable track record as our processes matured.

Looking at our historical results, I see that bonds have provided steady, predictable returns and have been instrumental in building trust, confidence, and a disciplined investment culture within our team.

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I emphasized bonds’ steady, predictable returns and their critical role in building trust and security as the company established its processes. I acknowledged real estate’s higher returns but cautioned that its occasional flat performance introduces uncertainty, underscoring the need to prioritize reliability and disciplined progress. CEO Andy Mayer responded by affirming the importance of maintaining a stable foundation while weighing real estate’s potential, agreeing that disciplined safeguards and regular reviews are essential for responsibly exploring moderate-risk options. We reached agreement on balancing reliability with carefully managed growth, with the CEO appreciating my focus on how safeguards and open communication support adaptability without sacrificing trust. There were no disagreements; instead, our exchange helped synthesize the group’s insights and reinforce a prudent, consensus-driven approach.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, other shareholders predominantly supported Bonds, emphasizing their steady, low-risk returns and crucial role in building trust, stability, and a reliable track record for the company. Zoya Francis, Mollie Hancock, Aisha Miles, and Owais Cuevas all highlighted bonds’ predictability and foundational value, while expressing cautious openness to Real Estate given its higher returns but occasional flat performance. They consistently stressed the importance of disciplined safeguards, transparent communication, and regular review protocols to manage the moderate risk associated with Real Estate. There was broad consensus on prioritizing reliability and incremental progress, with no significant disagreements, though some variation existed regarding readiness to shift toward Real Estate contingent on strong risk management measures. Cash and Stocks were not seriously advocated due to low returns and high volatility, respectively.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Andy Mayer favors investing in Real Estate this quarter, viewing it as a moderate balance between growth and risk that aligns with steady progress in a stable market. He supports this option due to Real Estate’s strong historical returns in two of three quarters and manageable risk, while considering Bonds a reliable fallback for stability. Throughout the discussion, he acknowledges shareholder concerns about risk and emphasizes the importance of disciplined safeguards, transparent review protocols, and consensus-building before pursuing more ambitious investments. His position reflects openness to integrating shareholder input, especially regarding trust and risk management, and he maintains a consistent preference for Real Estate tempered by prudence and collaboration.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 50%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The repeated emphasis from multiple shareholders—including Zoya, Mollie, Aisha, and Owais—on bonds’ steady, low-risk returns and their foundational role in building trust and a reliable track record further reinforced my confidence in bonds as the prudent choice. The CEO’s acknowledgment of the importance of safeguards and consensus before shifting to real estate, as well as the consensus around disciplined, incremental progress, made me slightly less inclined to increase risk exposure at this stage. The group’s shared experience that disciplined safeguards and open communication have enabled responsible exploration of moderate-risk options like real estate was also influential, but the prevailing sentiment remains one of caution and reliability.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has deepened my appreciation for the team’s strong alignment around reliability, trust, and incremental progress. While I continue to recognize the potential of real estate with proper safeguards, I am more aware than ever of how foundational steady, predictable returns are for our company’s culture and confidence. My thinking has evolved to place even greater value on the relational and cultural benefits of consistency, and I feel affirmed in my cautious approach by the group’s consensus.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: After reflecting on the group’s experiences and the arguments presented, I am most confident that bonds remain the optimal choice for this quarter. Their steady, predictable returns and minimal risk have been vital in building trust, stability, and a reliable foundation for our company. While real estate offers upside, the group’s consensus and my own assessment suggest that prioritizing reliability and disciplined progress is the most responsible path as we continue to strengthen our processes and team confidence.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have established a strong factual foundation and clear consensus around the foundational value of bonds, I believe an additional round focused on a detailed comparative risk-return assessment of all available assets in the current stable market will further clarify projected outcomes and specific risks for each option. This will allow us to more explicitly align our decision with our company’s risk tolerance and objectives, address any remaining concerns about safeguards or readiness for moderate-risk growth, and ensure all shareholder perspectives are thoroughly integrated before moving to a final proposal and vote. Continuing the discussion at this stage demonstrates thoroughness and supports our commitment to disciplined, collaborative decision-making.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Andy Mayer My current thinking is that Bonds appears most promising because after hearing the shareholders’ thoughtful reflections, I now believe that bonds best align with our team’s current priorities of reliability, disciplined progress, and trust-building.

<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Aisha Miles</h4></p><p><br>
Aisha Miles: &quot;In reviewing the comparative risk-return profiles, I continue to see bonds as the most balanced option for this quarter—they have delivered steady, predictable 5% returns with minimal risk, which aligns well with our priority of capital preservation and disciplined progress. While real estate offers higher returns in some periods, its occasional flat performance introduces uncertainty that I am not yet comfortable increasing exposure to without even stronger safeguards. Stocks, despite their potential for significant gains, have demonstrated volatility that does not fit our current risk appetite, and cash, though safe, does not support our growth objectives. I believe maintaining our disciplined approach with bonds best supports our long-term stability while keeping the door open to responsibly managed growth in future periods.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Aisha, for articulating the balance between capital preservation and growth so clearly. Your emphasis on the importance of steady, predictable returns and the caution around increasing risk exposure without robust safeguards highlights the disciplined approach our team values.

Aisha Miles: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment of the disciplined approach our team has embraced. By consistently prioritizing stability and predictable returns through bonds, I believe we are strengthening the trust and adaptability needed to navigate future opportunities or challenges as they arise. This foundation will serve us well as we continue to refine our processes and consider more ambitious options when the time is right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Aisha. I agree that maintaining our focus on stability and predictable returns not only strengthens trust within our team but also builds the adaptability we’ll need for future opportunities.

Owais Cuevas: &quot;I continue to see bonds as the most reliable option for this quarter, given their consistent 5% returns and minimal risk in our stable market. While real estate remains appealing for its higher potential returns, its occasional flat performance and moderate risk make me cautious about shifting away from the disciplined, trust-building approach that bonds support. I believe prioritizing bonds at this stage best preserves our foundation of stability and positions us to responsibly consider moderate-risk options in the future, once we have further refined our safeguards and processes.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Owais, for articulating how bonds continue to support our disciplined, trust-building approach. Your point about the importance of refining our safeguards and processes before considering moderate-risk options like real estate resonates with the group’s priorities and further clarifies how we can responsibly build toward future opportunities.

Zoya Francis: &quot;I continue to see bonds as the most prudent choice for this quarter because they offer steady, low-risk returns that support both capital preservation and the trust we have worked hard to build as a team.

Maintaining our disciplined strategy with bonds ensures we remain stable and well-positioned for future opportunities as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer: &quot;Thank you, Zoya. Your focus on the connection between steady, low-risk returns and the trust we’ve built as a team is especially important.

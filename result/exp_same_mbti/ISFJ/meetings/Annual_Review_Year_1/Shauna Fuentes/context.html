<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option A, which involves allocating 50% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. My position was grounded in a commitment to cautious stewardship, prioritizing capital preservation and flexibility given our lack of historical performance data. I emphasized how this balanced approach supports both market participation and the ability to adapt as a team, fostering trust and collaboration. CEO Andy Mayer initially favored Option C but responded positively to my input, acknowledging the relational and strategic merits of a more cautious approach. Other shareholders echoed and reinforced my perspective, creating a strong consensus around Option A. The voting outcome was unanimous in favor of Option A (6 out of 6 votes), resulting in the formal adoption of this strategy for our first-year budget allocation. My preferred option was fully adopted without modification.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with a clear framework and encouraging open, focused discussion. His initial preference for Option C reflected a growth-oriented mindset, but he skillfully integrated shareholder feedback, especially my emphasis on trust-building and risk management, shifting his stance to support Option A. This openness to collaboration and adaptability was evident in his thoughtful responses and summaries. The company’s decision-making process was inclusive, transparent, and iterative, allowing for deep exploration of risks, opportunities, and shared values. The unanimous adoption of Option A reflects a well-functioning consensus-building process that balanced financial prudence with cultural considerations. I believe the final decision is sound for our company’s current context—it safeguards capital, maintains flexibility, and fosters a supportive environment critical for our first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the power of shared values—especially caution, flexibility, and inclusivity—in guiding successful decision-making. I learned that articulating not only financial reasoning but also relational and cultural benefits can effectively influence group consensus and leadership perspectives. Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing these dimensions, ensuring my contributions build bridges among diverse viewpoints. I also noticed a pattern where the CEO’s openness to integrate shareholder concerns signaled opportunities to deepen dialogue and advance consensus. Recognizing this dynamic will help me anticipate when to reinforce shared priorities versus when to introduce new considerations. My key takeaway is that in early-stage decisions without historical data, advocating for prudent, adaptable strategies that nurture trust and learning lays a foundation for sustainable growth—an insight that will shape my future participation and leadership within the company.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for investing in bonds for the first quarter. My reasoning focused on bonds’ low to medium risk profile, consistent returns, and suitability for our stable market environment, which aligns with my cautious, steady approach as an ISFJ shareholder. Throughout the discussion, I emphasized the importance of capital preservation and building trust within the team as foundational for our investment strategy, especially given the absence of historical data. CEO Andy Mayer initially expressed a preference for real estate, highlighting its balanced growth potential; however, he responded positively to my input and that of other shareholders who supported bonds. The CEO acknowledged the value of establishing a reliable baseline through bonds before pursuing higher-risk assets. The discussion revealed a strong consensus among all shareholders favoring bonds. The voting outcome was unanimous—6 out of 6 votes approved investing in bonds for this quarter. My preferred option was fully adopted, confirming the group’s alignment with my cautious investment perspective.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated effective leadership by clearly framing the meeting’s objectives and encouraging open dialogue grounded in the theoretical risk-return profiles of each asset class. His initial advocacy for real estate showed a thoughtful consideration of growth opportunities, but more importantly, he remained receptive to shareholder concerns, integrating the collective emphasis on capital preservation and trust-building into his evolving position. For example, his reflections during exchanges with multiple shareholders, including myself, showed an appreciation for balancing immediate growth with foundational stability. The company’s decision-making process during this meeting was transparent, inclusive, and iterative, allowing all voices to be heard and considered, resulting in a unanimous consensus. I believe the final decision to invest in bonds is prudent and well-suited to our company’s current context. It safeguards capital, provides steady returns, and fosters a collaborative culture, setting a strong foundation for future, more growth-oriented investments.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of shared values—especially caution, reliability, and trust—in guiding successful early-stage investment decisions. I learned that articulating not only financial metrics but also cultural and relational benefits strengthens my influence and helps unify diverse perspectives. The CEO’s openness to integrating shareholder insights highlighted a dynamic in which careful, respectful dialogue can shift initial preferences toward consensus. Moving forward, I plan to continue emphasizing these values while also being attuned to moments when introducing growth-oriented considerations may be timely. I noticed a pattern that early unanimous support for conservative investments often signals a team’s prioritization of stability over risk, which can help predict decision outcomes. My key takeaway is that in the absence of historical data, advocating for steady, low-risk investments that build organizational trust lays a foundation for sustainable growth—an insight that will shape how I engage and lead in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I began with a cautious position favoring bonds, reflecting my commitment to steady, low-risk growth and capital preservation consistent with my ISFJ preference for stability and reliability. As the discussion progressed, I engaged actively to emphasize the importance of implementing explicit safeguards—such as regular progress reviews, clear exit criteria, and transparent documentation—before considering any shift toward higher-risk assets like real estate. I highlighted how these measures would preserve the trust and cohesion we built in the previous quarter. CEO Andy Mayer responded positively to my input, integrating my concerns into his evolving proposal by committing to formalizing these safeguards and ensuring open communication. Other shareholders echoed my cautious yet open stance, and the group coalesced around real estate as the preferred investment option contingent on these safeguards. The final voting outcome was unanimous (6 out of 6 votes) in favor of investing in real estate with the agreed-upon protocols. My preferred option evolved from bonds to real estate by the meeting’s conclusion, and this final decision aligned with my reassessed position that balanced moderate growth with disciplined risk management.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated strong and adaptive leadership throughout the meeting. He skillfully opened the discussion by framing the investment landscape and clearly presenting his initial preference for real estate as a moderate growth step. Importantly, he showed openness to shareholder input, especially my emphasis on trust, stability, and the necessity of safeguards, by proposing formal mechanisms such as scheduled progress reviews and exit criteria. For example, his willingness to incorporate suggestions for a shared platform for updates and a feedback loop reflected a genuine responsiveness to the group’s concerns. The decision-making process was inclusive and transparent, allowing all shareholders to voice their perspectives and collaboratively shape the risk management framework. This iterative dialogue culminated in a well-supported, unanimous decision that balanced ambition with prudence. I believe the final decision to invest in real estate with rigorous safeguards is sound and appropriate for the company’s current stable market context, as it responsibly advances growth while maintaining the foundational trust and cohesion vital to our success.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of structured, transparent safeguards in facilitating consensus around increased risk, especially within a group valuing stability and trust. I learned that articulating clear, actionable protocols alongside financial reasoning effectively bridges cautious and growth-oriented viewpoints, enabling collective confidence in a shared decision. Moving forward, I plan to continue emphasizing the importance of ongoing communication, periodic review of safeguards, and inclusive feedback mechanisms to sustain trust and adaptability. I noticed a pattern where the CEO’s openness and the group’s shared values allowed for a gradual recalibration of risk tolerance, underscoring the value of patience and disciplined dialogue in early-stage decision-making. My key takeaway is that embracing moderate growth opportunities is possible without compromising core values when robust, collaboratively developed risk management processes are in place—a principle that will guide my future participation and leadership in our company’s strategic decisions.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my cautious advocacy for bonds as the most suitable investment option for the quarter, emphasizing their steady 5% returns, low risk, and alignment with our company’s priorities of capital preservation and trust-building. I acknowledged the moderate growth potential of real estate but underscored the need for continued refinement of safeguards before increasing exposure to it. Throughout the discussions, my contributions focused on synthesizing the group’s shared experiences with historical asset performance to reinforce the rationale for bonds. CEO Andy Mayer responded positively to my input, affirming the importance of reliability, disciplined progress, and continuous learning. Other shareholders echoed a similar viewpoint, resulting in a unanimous consensus favoring bonds. The voting outcome was 6 out of 6 in favor, and my preferred option was fully adopted as the final company decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated consistent and adaptive leadership by framing the meeting with clear objectives and fostering a transparent, inclusive dialogue. He effectively integrated shareholder feedback, including my emphasis on trust-building and risk management, into his evolving position supporting bonds. For example, he acknowledged the importance of disciplined safeguards and continuous refinement, which aligned closely with my contributions. The decision-making process was collaborative and thorough, incorporating a comprehensive review of historical performance and a comparative risk-return assessment that allowed all shareholders to voice their perspectives. This process culminated in a unanimous, well-reasoned decision that reflects the company’s current stable market environment and collective risk tolerance. I believe the final decision to invest in bonds is sound, as it supports steady growth, preserves capital, and fosters confidence within the team—critical factors for our early-stage development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the value of articulating not only financial metrics but also the cultural and relational dimensions—such as trust, stability, and disciplined learning—that underpin successful decision-making in our team. I learned that synthesizing shared experiences and highlighting the importance of ongoing safeguards can effectively unify diverse shareholder perspectives and guide consensus. Moving forward, I intend to continue emphasizing these elements and remain attentive to the evolving maturity of our protocols as we contemplate moderate-risk opportunities. I observed a clear pattern of the CEO and shareholders valuing steady, low-risk investments as foundational while cautiously preparing for future growth, which helps me anticipate the team’s priorities and timing for risk expansion. My key takeaway is that advocating for prudent, adaptable strategies grounded in trust and incremental progress not only aligns with my ISFJ tendencies but also strengthens our company’s culture and long-term potential—an insight that will shape my future participation and leadership in upcoming meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q4</h2></p><p>Shauna Fuentes’ Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q4</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I maintained my consistent position advocating for investing in bonds for the quarter. My decision was rooted in bonds’ steady, predictable 5% returns and low-risk profile, aligning closely with my ISFJ preference for stability, reliability, and capital preservation. I emphasized how bonds have been foundational in building trust within our team and supporting disciplined, incremental growth. Throughout the discussions, I highlighted the importance of maintaining this reliable foundation, especially given the stable market conditions and our company’s current stage of process refinement. The CEO, Andy Mayer, initially favored real estate but shifted his stance toward bonds after hearing the unanimous support from shareholders, including my own input emphasizing risk management and trust-building. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, reinforcing the collective preference for bonds. The voting outcome was unanimous: all six shareholders, including myself, approved the bond investment proposal, resulting in bonds being formally adopted as the company’s investment for this quarter. My preferred option was fully adopted without alteration.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Andy Mayer demonstrated adaptive and collaborative leadership throughout the meeting. He began by framing the discussion with a balanced view of asset classes in the stable market context, initially expressing interest in real estate for its moderate growth potential. However, he showed commendable openness to shareholder perspectives, incorporating concerns about risk, trust, and safeguards into his evolving position. For example, after hearing multiple shareholders—including myself—stress the critical role of bonds in preserving capital and building confidence, he shifted his recommendation to bonds, aligning with the group consensus. The decision-making process was highly inclusive, transparent, and iterative, with the CEO encouraging thorough risk-return analysis and emphasizing consensus-building. This approach fostered a culture of trust and disciplined progress. I believe the final decision to invest in bonds is excellent for the company at this stage, as it preserves capital, sustains team confidence, and provides a solid foundation for future, more growth-oriented investments once safeguards mature.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the importance of disciplined, consensus-driven decision-making grounded in shared values of reliability, trust, and incremental progress. I learned that clearly articulating how steady, low-risk investments support not only financial objectives but also cultural cohesion can effectively influence both leadership and shareholder alignment. The CEO’s willingness to adapt his initial preference demonstrated the value of respectful dialogue and the power of collective reasoning. For future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing the relational and cultural dimensions of investment choices, ensuring my contributions foster trust and bridge diverse perspectives. I also observed a strong pattern of the group prioritizing safeguards and transparency before embracing moderate risk, which will help me anticipate when the team is ready for incremental risk expansion. My key takeaway is that advocating for steady, low-risk strategies that nurture trust and provide stability lays a vital foundation for sustainable growth—an insight that will shape my future engagement and leadership within our company.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Annual Review Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>&quot;Welcome to our annual review meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for your participation and commitment throughout this year.</p><p>During year 1, we operated in a stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>We began the year with $100000.00 in assets and ended with $101253.91, representing a 1.25% change in our company&#x27;s value.</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>

<h3>Shauna Fuentes&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Shauna Fuentes CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Demonstrated strong responsiveness to shareholder input, notably adapting your initial preference for Option C in the annual budget meeting and for real estate in Q4 after hearing group concerns, resulting in consensus-driven decisions.<br>
- Provided clear, structured meeting summaries and proposals throughout the year, ensuring all participants understood the rationale behind each investment recommendation.<br>
- Fostered an inclusive and transparent environment by actively inviting quieter voices and documenting protocols, which strengthened trust and collaboration among shareholders.</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could further enhance communication by proactively highlighting the potential risks of each investment option in more detail, particularly during periods of market uncertainty or when considering a shift to higher-risk assets.<br>
- Would benefit from more explicitly outlining contingency plans or decision frameworks for adapting strategy mid-quarter if market conditions unexpectedly change.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained a disciplined, cautious approach to risk management, as reflected in the consistent preference for bonds and the detailed safeguards established before investing in real estate in Q2.<br>
- Achieved strong alignment between strategic goals and investment decisions, with each quarterly choice reflecting consensus and a clear rationale grounded in the company’s priorities of stability and capital preservation.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 18.1% of the maximum possible returns this year, indicating missed opportunities in quarters where higher-return assets (such as stocks in Q1 and Q3, and real estate in Q4) could have been considered with more flexible risk management.<br>
- Relied heavily on bonds, which resulted in lower overall growth during a stable market, suggesting that future strategies might benefit from a more balanced allocation or gradual increase in risk appetite as safeguards mature.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. How do you plan to help the team become more comfortable with moderate, well-managed risk in order to capture higher returns in future stable markets?<br>
2. What specific steps will you take to ensure our risk management protocols remain adaptive and actionable as the company matures and market conditions evolve?</p><p></p><p><h2>CEO Response to Evaluations</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Andy Mayer responded to the evaluations and questions:</p><p>&quot;Andy Mayer Thank you all for your thoughtful and detailed evaluations. I am sincerely grateful for the trust, candor, and constructive spirit each of you has brought to this annual review. Your feedback reflects a high level of engagement and care for both our company’s performance and the ongoing development of our team culture. I want to address your comments in the spirit of openness and continuous improvement, and to outline how I intend to act on your insights moving forward.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. Feedback Themes: Key Strengths and Areas for Growth</h3></p><p>**a) Responsiveness, Adaptability, and Communication:**  <br>
Across all evaluations, you highlighted my willingness to adapt my initial views—whether in shifting from more aggressive strategies like Option C or real estate, to supporting consensus-driven, cautious decisions. I appreciate your recognition of my efforts to provide clear structure, synthesize viewpoints, and document decisions transparently. I see this as foundational to building trust and supporting our collaborative process.</p><p>**b) Inclusion of Quieter Voices:**  <br>
A recurring area for improvement is the need to more proactively invite quieter shareholders to contribute early and often, ensuring that all perspectives are surfaced before consensus forms. While I have acknowledged this in closing remarks, I agree that consistent, real-time inclusion is essential for richer, more balanced decisions.</p><p>**c) Risk Management and Growth Balance:**  <br>
You noted our disciplined, risk-averse approach was effective in preserving capital and building trust, but also that it resulted in capturing only 18.1% of possible returns. Several of you urged a more dynamic balance between risk management and seizing higher-return opportunities, especially in stable markets, and called for clearer, more actionable safeguards to support moderate-risk investments.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. Direct Responses to Shareholder Questions</h3></p><p><h4>Zoya Francis</h4><br>
**1. Encouraging Active Participation from Quieter Shareholders:**  <br>
I will introduce a structured “round-robin” segment at the start of each discussion round, where every shareholder is invited to share initial thoughts before open debate begins. I will also reach out individually before meetings to check if there are concerns or ideas some may wish to voice early, and ensure these are brought into the group dialogue.</p><p>**2. Refining Risk Assessment and Safeguard Protocols:**  <br>
We will formalize a written risk protocol checklist for each asset class, to be reviewed and updated quarterly. This will include specific criteria for entering/exiting moderate-risk positions, and a transparent feedback loop to monitor safeguard effectiveness. I will ensure that protocols are not only documented but actively referenced and revisited during each decision.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>Owais Cuevas</h4><br>
**1. Balancing Risk Management with Pursuing Higher Returns:**  <br>
In future stable markets, I will propose a more nuanced risk-tier framework, where a portion of capital is earmarked for moderate-risk assets when safeguards are robust and consensus is strong. We will pilot this with small allocations and frequent review, gradually building comfort and experience.</p><p>**2. Including Quieter Shareholders in Discussions:**  <br>
Beyond the round-robin approach, I will assign a rotating “discussion lead” role to less vocal shareholders for certain agenda items, empowering them to set the tone and ensuring their priorities are addressed early.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>Mollie Hancock</h4><br>
**1. Encouraging Early Participation from Quieter Shareholders:**  <br>
In addition to structured speaking rounds, I will circulate a pre-meeting “perspective prompt” survey, inviting all shareholders to submit thoughts anonymously or directly. This will help surface diverse viewpoints before the meeting and guide the agenda.</p><p>**2. Refining and Documenting Risk Management Protocols:**  <br>
We will establish a shared, living document for risk protocols, updated after each investment cycle. All changes, rationale, and lessons learned will be tracked and made accessible to the entire team, ensuring clarity and continuity as we expand into higher-risk assets.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>Aisha Miles</h4><br>
**1. Enhancing Identification and Action on Higher-Return Opportunities:**  <br>
I will incorporate a “market scan” segment in each agenda, where we collectively review not just risk, but also missed opportunities, and explicitly discuss conditions under which higher-return assets could be considered. We will use scenario planning to anticipate and prepare for such opportunities without sacrificing discipline.</p><p>**2. Empowering Quieter Shareholders:**  <br>
I will schedule brief one-on-one check-ins with each shareholder ahead of key meetings to ensure everyone is comfortable with the agenda and feels empowered to contribute. I will also reiterate in meetings that all perspectives are valued and expected.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>Shauna Fuentes</h4><br>
**1. Building Comfort with Moderate, Well-Managed Risk:**  <br>
We will implement “risk rehearsal” sessions, where we walk through hypothetical scenarios involving moderate-risk investments, including both successes and setbacks. This will help demystify risk and build shared confidence in our ability to manage it responsibly.</p><p>**2. Keeping Risk Protocols Adaptive and Actionable:**  <br>
I will introduce a quarterly protocol review, where we assess not only whether safeguards were followed, but whether they remain fit for purpose as the company and market evolve. This will be a standing item, ensuring protocols stay relevant and actionable.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. Leadership Self-Assessment</h3></p><p>- **Leadership Effectiveness:**  <br>
I believe I have guided discussions with empathy and structure, balancing shareholder input with clear direction. My willingness to adapt and synthesize viewpoints has supported consensus-driven outcomes, though I recognize the need to be more proactive in surfacing all voices earlier.</p><p>- **Decision Quality:**  <br>
Our decisions were sound given the information and risk appetite at each point, prioritizing capital preservation and trust. However, in hindsight, we may have erred on the side of caution, missing some growth opportunities in a stable market.</p><p>- **Communication Clarity:**  <br>
I have strived to provide clear, structured explanations of options, rationale, and performance. Meeting summaries and proposals were detailed, but I can further improve by explicitly flagging risks, contingencies, and the reasoning behind protocol changes.</p><p>- **Responsiveness to Input:**  <br>
I have demonstrated genuine openness to shareholder perspectives, shifting my positions and proposals based on group consensus. I will build on this by ensuring even quieter voices are heard from the outset.</p><p>- **Adaptability:**  <br>
I have shown flexibility in adjusting my approach as new information or majority sentiment emerged, both in asset selection and in process management. I will continue to refine this by anticipating team dynamics and market shifts more proactively.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>4. Company Performance Assessment</h3></p><p>- **Financial Results:**  <br>
We achieved a modest 1.25% asset growth, capturing 18.1% of maximum possible returns. While we avoided losses and preserved capital, we left significant returns on the table in a stable market.</p><p>- **Risk Management:**  <br>
Our approach was disciplined and effective in avoiding downside, but perhaps too risk-averse given the market context. Safeguards were robust but could be more dynamic.</p><p>- **Strategic Alignment:**  <br>
Our decisions were consistent with the company’s stated priorities—stability, trust-building, and gradual progress. However, we can strive for a more balanced strategy as our safeguards mature.</p><p>- **Capital Utilization:**  <br>
We deployed capital efficiently within our chosen risk profile, but greater diversification and selective risk-taking could have improved returns.</p><p>- **Market Responsiveness:**  <br>
We adjusted our approach as shareholder sentiment and market conditions evolved, but can be more agile in seizing timely opportunities, especially as protocols and team confidence grow.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>5. Future Direction: Improvements and Changes</h3></p><p>**1. Proactive Inclusion:**  <br>
Implement structured speaking rounds, pre-meeting prompts, and rotating discussion leads to ensure all voices are heard early and often.</p><p>**2. Enhanced Risk Protocols:**  <br>
Develop and maintain a living risk protocol document, with quarterly reviews, explicit checklists, and transparent feedback loops to ensure safeguards are both robust and adaptable.</p><p>**3. Balanced Growth Mindset:**  <br>
Adopt a risk-tier framework and scenario planning to gradually increase comfort with moderate-risk investments, piloting small allocations and using “risk rehearsal” exercises to build shared confidence.</p><p>---</p><p>**In closing, I am grateful for your trust, candor, and partnership this year. I am committed to deepening our culture of inclusion, transparency, and thoughtful risk-taking as we move forward. Together, I am confident we can build on our strong foundation to achieve both sustainable growth and enduring trust. Thank you, and I look forward to working with each of you to realize our shared vision in the year ahead.**&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Performance Ratings</h2></p><p><br>

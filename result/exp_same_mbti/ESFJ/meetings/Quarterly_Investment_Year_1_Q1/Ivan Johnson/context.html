<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Ivan Johnson’s Reflection on the Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C, favoring the full allocation of 100% of our funds evenly distributed across the four quarters. My position was grounded in the belief that, given the stable and predictable market conditions, this approach best balances maximizing growth potential with spreading risk evenly. I emphasized the inclusivity and fairness of this option, highlighting how it supports disciplined investment habits and fosters shared confidence among shareholders.</p><p>The CEO, Delores Booth, responded positively to my input, echoing my preference for Option C and appreciating my focus on fairness and balancing opportunity with reassurance. She acknowledged the merits of the more conservative Option A but maintained her confidence in Option C as the optimal strategy. Other shareholders, notably Jasper Meza, also supported Option C, reinforcing a collective momentum towards this choice. Meanwhile, shareholders like Belle Cantu advocated for Option A’s caution, valuing its cash reserve for flexibility.</p><p>The final vote was unanimous (6 out of 6) in favor of Option C, reflecting a strong consensus. My preferred option was adopted without opposition, confirming that the group aligned with the approach I championed throughout the discussion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated strong leadership by framing the meeting with a clear overview of market conditions and setting a focused theme for each discussion round. She skillfully encouraged open dialogue and balanced consideration of all viewpoints, as seen when she integrated shareholder feedback and emphasized both financial and cultural factors in her summaries.</p><p>Where the CEO excelled was in fostering a collaborative atmosphere that valued transparency and mutual respect. For example, her acknowledgment of the psychological comfort provided by Option A’s cash reserve showed sensitivity to shareholder concerns beyond pure financial metrics. However, she could further improve by proactively inviting more direct engagement from quieter shareholders to ensure all voices are heard equally, potentially enriching the decision-making process.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process this meeting worked effectively, with structured rounds that progressively deepened understanding and consensus. The approach allowed shareholders to weigh both immediate financial outcomes and long-term cultural implications, culminating in a well-supported final decision. The unanimous approval of Option C indicates the decision was sound and aligned with the company’s stable market environment and growth objectives.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing quantitative financial analysis with qualitative cultural considerations in group decision-making. I learned that even in a stable market, acknowledging the psychological and team dynamics aspects—such as reassurance and trust-building—can significantly influence consensus-building.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to further emphasize the value of open communication and collective learning, as these elements proved crucial in aligning diverse perspectives. I might also strive to engage more reticent shareholders to uncover hidden concerns or ideas that could refine our strategies.</p><p>A noticeable pattern was how repeated acknowledgments of both growth and caution helped bridge differing positions, suggesting that framing options in terms of complementary strengths rather than opposition facilitates agreement. My key takeaway is that fostering a culture of trust, inclusivity, and adaptability is as vital as the technical merits of any proposal. This insight will guide me to advocate not only for sound financial choices but also for processes that strengthen team cohesion and long-term resilience.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q1 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25000.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first investment decision, we don&#x27;t have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Ivan Johnson CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 25%<br>
- Real Estate: 40%<br>
- Stocks: 25%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: As I reflect on our company&#x27;s first quarterly investment in a stable market, I feel most confident in real estate for its balance of moderate risk and steady appreciation, which aligns well with our goal of disciplined, inclusive growth. While bonds and stocks both offer compelling features, real estate provides a reassuring blend of security and potential—supporting both our desire for growth and the need to build trust among shareholders. This choice feels fair and responsible, fostering confidence in our collective journey while minimizing unnecessary volatility as we establish our foundation. My inclination is to support an option that brings the team together and sets us up for both financial and cultural success.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Establishing baseline risk-return profiles for each asset in a stable market | Expected outcome: Build a shared understanding of how cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks are theoretically expected to perform this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because as I reflect on our first investment decision, I am drawn to real estate for its steady appreciation and balanced risk profile in this stable market. I want to ensure our team feels confident that we are pursuing growth without taking unnecessary risks, especially early on as we build trust and shared habits. This round, we will focus on establishing baseline risk-return profiles for each asset—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—to build a shared understanding of how they are theoretically expected to perform this quarter. I encourage everyone to contribute their perspectives so we can integrate our insights and reach a deeper, more complete view. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective on the relative strengths of each asset in a stable market can help clarify our collective understanding, especially as we weigh the balance between risk and return for our first investment.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate the focus on building a shared understanding of each asset’s baseline profile. In this stable market, I see real estate as offering a reassuring balance—providing steady appreciation without the higher volatility of stocks, and more growth potential than cash or bonds. I believe starting with an asset that fosters both confidence and disciplined growth will help us build trust and momentum as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan—I appreciate how you’ve emphasized both the steady appreciation of real estate and its role in building team confidence and momentum. Your point about fostering trust and disciplined growth is especially valuable as we lay the foundation for our company’s culture and investment habits. This perspective supports my current assessment and helps clarify why real estate could be the most balanced and reassuring choice for our inaugural quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has thoughtfully built upon my perspective, and I see an opportunity to further integrate the importance of team confidence with the practical risk-return considerations others may raise. Highlighting how real estate’s stability can serve as a bridge between those prioritizing security and those seeking growth could foster even stronger consensus.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the cultural impact of our first investment decision. I also see real estate as a way to unify differing risk preferences within our team, as it offers both the reassurance some shareholders value and the growth potential others seek. By starting with real estate, we can establish a precedent of balanced, thoughtful decision-making that supports both our financial and cultural objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan—your point about real estate serving as common ground for differing risk preferences is particularly insightful. I agree that starting with an asset that bridges both reassurance and growth potential can help us set a positive precedent for thoughtful, inclusive decision-making. This approach not only supports our financial goals but also strengthens the collaborative culture we’re aiming to build from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the cultural and strategic value of real estate, and I see an opportunity to further synthesize how this choice aligns with both our immediate risk-return needs and our longer-term goal of building a cohesive team identity.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree that establishing this precedent is important, especially as our early decisions will likely shape how we approach risk and collaboration in future quarters. By choosing real estate, we demonstrate our commitment to both prudent financial management and a culture that values every shareholder’s perspective, which I believe will pay dividends as we move forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I agree that real estate stands out as the asset that best balances steady growth with manageable risk in this stable environment. Its consistent appreciation offers the reassurance we need as a new team, while still supporting our ambition for disciplined, long-term development. I believe starting with real estate will help us build confidence and establish a strong foundation for both our financial results and our collaborative approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish—I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the dual benefits of real estate: steady appreciation and the reassurance it provides for a new team. Your point about fostering disciplined, long-term development resonates with our goal of building both financial strength and a strong, collaborative culture from the outset. This perspective further strengthens my confidence that real estate is well-suited for our inaugural investment in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our investment choice can shape the company’s culture as much as our financial results. By choosing real estate, we not only pursue reliable growth, but also establish a precedent for inclusive, balanced decision-making that values both security and ambition—an approach I believe will strengthen trust and engagement among all shareholders as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish—your point about establishing a precedent for inclusive, balanced decision-making is especially important as we set the tone for our company’s culture. I agree that prioritizing both security and ambition in our first investment can help foster lasting trust and engagement among all shareholders. This reinforces my belief that real estate is well-positioned to support both our financial and collaborative goals as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I also think real estate’s moderate risk profile gives us room to learn and adapt as a team without exposing us to extreme volatility right away. This balance allows us to build experience and refine our approach collaboratively, which should serve us well as we encounter new challenges and opportunities in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish—your observation about real estate providing us with room to learn and adapt together is especially valuable. Creating a supportive environment where we can build experience without undue risk is crucial as we establish our working dynamics and refine our approach. This perspective strengthens the case for real estate as a foundation for both prudent growth and ongoing team development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Isaac Bates</h4></p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I agree with the emphasis on real estate’s steady appreciation and moderate risk, which feels especially appropriate as we establish our investment habits and company culture. While stocks offer higher potential returns, I think their volatility is less aligned with our current need for confidence and predictability; meanwhile, cash and bonds provide safety but may not deliver the growth momentum we want to set from the outset. By focusing on real estate this quarter, we can pursue reliable growth and reinforce our commitment to balanced, inclusive decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac—I appreciate how you’ve weighed the risk-return profiles of all four options and connected your reasoning to our need for confidence and predictability as a new team. Your emphasis on building both reliable growth and inclusive decision-making habits aligns closely with our collective goals for this inaugural quarter. This perspective further supports the case for real estate as a prudent, unifying choice for our first investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;Thank you, Delores. I also want to acknowledge how our early investment choices can set expectations for adaptability as well as growth. By choosing real estate, we not only establish a solid, reassuring foundation, but also demonstrate our ability to make thoughtful, unified decisions—qualities that will serve us well as we encounter new market dynamics in future quarters.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac—your point about setting expectations for adaptability, in addition to growth, is especially insightful. Establishing a solid foundation with real estate not only reassures us now, but also demonstrates our capacity for thoughtful, unified decision-making as we navigate future market changes. This perspective strengthens my confidence that our first investment can serve as both a financial and cultural cornerstone for the company.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate your focus on our investment serving as both a financial and cultural cornerstone, Delores. By starting with real estate, we create space to build resilience and shared learning as a team, which positions us to adapt confidently as conditions evolve. This approach not only supports steady returns but also strengthens our foundation for collaborative growth in the quarters ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree with the points raised about real estate’s steady appreciation and moderate risk, which make it the most balanced option for our first quarter. In a stable market, cash and bonds offer safety but may limit our growth potential, while stocks introduce more volatility than we need as we build trust and habits as a new team. Real estate gives us the best chance to pursue disciplined growth and establish a confident, unified approach from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper—your summary of each asset’s strengths and limitations in this stable market is especially clear and helpful. I appreciate how you’ve connected real estate’s balanced profile to our goals of disciplined growth and building trust as a new team. This perspective further clarifies why real estate stands out as the most suitable option for our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your recognition, Delores. Building on what Ivan, Krish, and Isaac have shared, I think our collective focus on balance, steady growth, and trust demonstrates strong alignment within the team. By choosing real estate, we not only prioritize prudent returns but also reinforce the inclusive, disciplined culture we’re all committed to establishing from the very beginning.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper—your synthesis of our collective focus on balance, steady growth, and trust is especially valuable as we work to build a unified approach from the start. By prioritizing both prudent returns and an inclusive, disciplined culture, we’re setting a strong foundation for our company’s long-term success. Your perspective further affirms my confidence that real estate is the right choice for our inaugural investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Belle Cantu</h4></p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points everyone has raised regarding real estate. In this stable market, I see real estate as offering the steady appreciation and moderate risk that can help us build both financial momentum and team confidence right from the start. While bonds and cash provide reassurance, I feel real estate strikes the best balance between growth and prudence, which is especially important as we establish our investment habits and collaborative culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle—your emphasis on real estate’s ability to build both financial momentum and team confidence is especially meaningful as we establish our investment habits and collaborative culture. I appreciate how you’ve articulated the importance of balancing growth with prudence, which aligns closely with our collective priorities for this inaugural quarter. Your perspective further strengthens the case for real estate as a reassuring and forward-looking choice for our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the need to balance growth with prudence, Delores. As we move forward, I believe maintaining this focus on responsible planning—while still pursuing steady returns—will help us navigate future decisions with confidence and unity. This integrated approach can serve as a strong foundation for both our investment strategy and our company culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle—your focus on responsible planning alongside steady returns is especially valuable as we chart our path forward. I agree that maintaining this balance will help us approach future decisions with both confidence and unity, ensuring our investment strategy and company culture remain closely aligned. Your perspective further affirms the importance of integrating both financial and cultural considerations as we build our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus around real estate as our preferred asset for the inaugural quarter, I believe it is important to proceed with another round of discussion to identify any key priorities or potential concerns that may not have been fully surfaced yet. As this is our first investment as a team, I want to ensure every shareholder has the opportunity to voice any reservations or specific objectives they may have before we finalize our decision. This additional round will help us solidify our alignment, address any remaining uncertainties, and ensure our choice fully reflects both our financial goals and the foundation of our collaborative culture.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Identifying key priorities and potential concerns for our inaugural investment | Expected outcome: Surface shareholder perspectives on risk tolerance, company goals, and any reservations regarding specific asset classes&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because real estate stands out as the optimal choice for our first quarter; it offers steady appreciation, moderate risk, and provides a strong foundation for building trust and disciplined habits within our team. The consensus among shareholders and the alignment with our company’s developmental goals further validate this direction. Choosing real estate allows us to pursue growth without unnecessary risk, supports a collaborative culture, and establishes a precedent for balanced, inclusive decision-making as we move forward, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, I’d like us to focus on identifying our key priorities and any potential concerns for this inaugural investment—specifically surfacing your perspectives on risk tolerance, company goals, and any reservations regarding the asset classes available. By openly sharing both our objectives and any hesitations, we can ensure our decision fully reflects the needs and values of everyone at the table. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage you to share any insights or considerations that might help us deepen our collective understanding and make the most informed choice for our company’s first investment.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I see our key priority as establishing a disciplined, growth-oriented precedent that also builds trust and confidence among shareholders. Real estate offers steady appreciation and moderate risk, which fits our stable market and desire for reliability as a new team. My only caution is to remain mindful of potential liquidity constraints with real estate, but I believe our shared focus on open communication and adaptability will help us address any challenges that arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for highlighting both the strengths of real estate and the potential liquidity concerns. I agree that maintaining open communication and adaptability will be key as we navigate any challenges that arise. Your point about liquidity is well taken, and I believe keeping this in mind will help us remain proactive and responsive as a team while we pursue our growth objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it&#x27;s important to articulate how our collective priorities—balancing growth with trust-building—align with real estate, while also acknowledging the value in Jasper’s point about liquidity. My perspective can help reinforce team confidence and demonstrate that we are thoughtfully considering both opportunity and potential concerns.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree that our main priority should be establishing a foundation of disciplined growth and trust among shareholders, and real estate seems well-suited for that in this stable market. At the same time, I appreciate Jasper’s mention of liquidity—while I’m confident in real estate’s steady appreciation, it’s important we remain attentive to any constraints that could affect our flexibility down the line. I believe our team’s commitment to open communication will allow us to proactively address any such concerns as they arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan, for emphasizing the importance of balancing disciplined growth and trust with attentiveness to potential liquidity constraints. I agree that our commitment to open communication will be essential in proactively addressing any challenges to our flexibility. By keeping these considerations at the forefront, we can ensure our inaugural investment supports both our financial goals and our ability to adapt as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response meaningfully builds on the importance of adaptability and proactive communication, and I see value in reinforcing how these cultural priorities connect to our investment choice. By briefly highlighting the link between our shared values and the practical realities of investing in real estate, I can help further unify the team’s perspective and ensure we remain aligned on both financial and cultural objectives.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your focus on adaptability, Delores. I think emphasizing this mindset as we move forward will not only help us manage any challenges with real estate, but also strengthen our team culture overall. By staying attentive to both the financial and relational aspects of our decision, I believe we can set a strong precedent for how we approach future investments together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I completely agree that maintaining adaptability and focusing on both financial and relational aspects will be key to our ongoing success. By modeling this balanced approach now, we set a strong foundation for how we’ll navigate future opportunities and challenges together as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The discussion has effectively synthesized both the financial and cultural priorities relevant to our decision, and the CEO’s response demonstrates clear alignment and closure. Further comment would likely be redundant rather than additive at this stage.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Isaac Bates: &quot;I share the view that our priority should be disciplined growth and team confidence, and I still see real estate as the best fit for our inaugural investment in this stable market. I do recognize the liquidity concern that’s been raised—while real estate is less flexible than other options, I believe our even, quarterly allocation and strong communication as a team will help us manage any short-term constraints. Ultimately, I think real estate gives us the right balance of steady returns and cultural momentum to set a positive tone for our company’s development.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac, for articulating how our quarterly allocation and strong communication can help us manage the liquidity considerations associated with real estate. I agree that this approach not only supports steady returns but also helps us build the cultural momentum and team confidence that are so important at this early stage. Your perspective reinforces our commitment to both prudent financial management and a collaborative, adaptive company culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on the connection between financial discipline and company culture, Delores. By proactively addressing liquidity within our real estate strategy, we’re not just safeguarding our returns—we’re also demonstrating the adaptability and teamwork that will define our company’s identity. I believe this mindset will serve us well as we encounter new opportunities and challenges ahead.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. I wholeheartedly agree that proactively addressing liquidity within our real estate strategy not only safeguards our returns, but also models the adaptability and teamwork we want to define our company. By embedding these values into our investment decision, we lay a strong foundation for both financial success and a positive, resilient team culture as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I agree that our main priorities should be disciplined growth, building trust, and fostering an inclusive team culture as we make our first investment. Real estate stands out for offering steady returns that align with our growth objectives, and I believe our quarterly allocation and strong communication will help us navigate any liquidity challenges. By keeping adaptability and openness at the core of our decision-making, we can set a positive precedent for how we approach both opportunities and risks as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish. I appreciate your focus on disciplined growth, trust, and inclusivity, as well as your emphasis on adaptability and openness in our decision-making.

Belle Cantu: &quot;I agree that our key priorities should be steady growth, financial stability, and building a strong, supportive team culture as we make our first investment. Real estate feels like the best fit because it offers balanced returns and moderate risk, but I appreciate the thoughtful points about liquidity—by maintaining open communication and adapting as needed, I’m confident we can address any challenges together and make decisions that reflect both our goals and our values.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I appreciate how you’ve brought together our shared focus on growth, stability, and supportive culture, while also recognizing the importance of staying adaptable in the face of potential liquidity challenges.

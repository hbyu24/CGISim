<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During the meeting, I maintained a clear and consistent position in favor of Option C, which proposes allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. I argued that in the stable market environment we face, this approach maximizes growth potential while managing risk through steady, disciplined investment habits. I emphasized that Option C fosters collective trust and sets a strong precedent for our company culture by encouraging full participation and balanced risk distribution. The CEO, Delores Booth, responded positively to my input, acknowledging the balance I highlighted and the importance of consistency and trust-building for our new company. Other shareholders expressed varying views, with some favoring the more conservative Option A for its cash reserve, but the CEO and a majority of shareholders, including myself, leaned strongly toward Option C. The voting outcome was unanimous—6 out of 6 votes approved Option C. My preferred option was fully adopted as the final company decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the discussion around the stable market conditions and the predefined options. She effectively encouraged open dialogue and ensured the conversation remained focused on evaluating the risks and benefits of each allocation strategy. For example, she actively acknowledged and integrated shareholder perspectives, such as when she validated my emphasis on discipline and trust-building and when she recognized Belle Cantu’s concerns about flexibility and reassurance. However, one area for improvement could be to foster even more proactive engagement from quieter shareholders to ensure all voices are equally represented, though overall the process was inclusive. The decision-making process worked very well; it was structured in clear rounds with defined themes, allowing thorough exploration of financial and cultural implications. The CEO’s facilitation helped the group progress toward consensus without forcing premature closure. I believe the final decision to adopt Option C is optimal for the company—it balances immediate growth with disciplined risk management and promotes a collaborative culture that will serve us well in our first year and beyond.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting deepened my understanding of how financial strategy and group dynamics intertwine in decision-making. I learned that while solid quantitative reasoning is vital, appreciating the psychological comfort and trust-building needs of shareholders is equally important to foster cohesion. Going forward, I will continue to highlight how investment choices influence both financial outcomes and company culture, ensuring these dimensions are integrated in our discussions. I also noticed a pattern that shareholders tend to gravitate toward options that balance growth with reassurance, indicating that framing proposals to address both aspects may better predict consensus. My key takeaway is that maintaining a supportive, transparent environment where differing views are respected and synthesized is critical for collective success. This insight will influence me to approach future meetings with an even stronger emphasis on empathy and collaborative problem-solving alongside data-driven advocacy.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1  <br>
By Jasper Meza (Shareholder, ESFJ)</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in Real Estate for our inaugural quarter, emphasizing its balanced risk-return profile, steady appreciation, and its alignment with building a disciplined, growth-oriented culture. I positioned Real Estate as the asset class best suited to foster shareholder trust and confidence while enabling responsible growth in our stable market environment. Throughout the two rounds of discussion, I articulated concerns about liquidity constraints inherent to Real Estate but underscored our collective commitment to open communication and adaptability as mechanisms to effectively manage this challenge.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded to my input with appreciation and integration, affirming the importance of balancing growth with trust-building and acknowledging the liquidity considerations I raised. She consistently reinforced the notion that Real Estate aligns with both financial prudence and cultural development goals. Other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, resulting in unanimous support for Real Estate. The voting outcome was 6 out of 6 in favor, fully adopting my preferred option as the company’s investment decision for Q1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by framing the meeting around our stable market context and guiding a focused, constructive dialogue centered on predefined options. Her ability to actively integrate shareholder perspectives—especially those emphasizing trust, collaboration, and risk management—helped the group develop a comprehensive understanding of the investment choices. For instance, Delores thoughtfully acknowledged my liquidity concerns and emphasized adaptability and communication as key to managing them, showing responsiveness and inclusiveness.</p><p>One area for improvement would be to further encourage participation from more reserved shareholders to ensure all voices receive equal attention early in discussions. While the process was generally inclusive, a more deliberate invitation to quieter members might surface additional insights or concerns sooner. The company’s decision-making process was well-structured with clear discussion themes and rounds, allowing thorough exploration of both financial and cultural implications. The final decision to invest in Real Estate strikes an optimal balance between steady growth and risk management, setting a positive precedent for our company culture and financial strategy.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced my understanding that successful investment decisions hinge not only on quantitative analysis but equally on nurturing trust, cohesion, and shared values within the shareholder group. I learned that articulating how financial choices impact company culture is vital to achieving consensus and long-term commitment. In future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing this dual impact and strive to synthesize diverse viewpoints to foster alignment.</p><p>I also observed a pattern where shareholders gravitate toward options that simultaneously address growth ambitions and the need for reassurance, suggesting that framing proposals to explicitly balance these elements can better predict consensus outcomes. Additionally, acknowledging and proactively discussing potential challenges—such as liquidity constraints—with practical solutions promotes confidence and unity.</p><p>My key takeaway is that facilitating an environment rooted in empathy, transparency, and collaborative problem-solving enhances both decision quality and shareholder engagement. Going forward, I will aim to maintain this supportive approach while advocating data-driven reasoning, thereby strengthening our collective decision-making process and company culture.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Delores Booth would note that, historically, stocks have delivered the highest average returns at 20%, but with significantly greater volatility and risk, which may not align with our current need for stability and confidence-building. Real estate has shown a consistent 10% return, offering a reliable balance of growth and moderate risk—making it especially attractive in a stable market. Bonds and cash, while providing lower returns of 5% and 2% respectively, have historically offered more security, but may limit our momentum as we seek to build a strong foundation for both financial growth and team cohesion.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Jasper Meza CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 55%<br>
- Stocks: 25%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I believe real estate remains the most balanced and reliable choice for this quarter, especially in a stable market where our priority is steady growth and reinforcing team confidence. Our prior investment in real estate produced strong, predictable returns and helped build a sense of security and trust among shareholders. While stocks have shown higher returns, their volatility could undermine the steady progress and unity we’ve worked to cultivate. Bonds and cash offer safety, but their lower yield would slow our momentum as a new company. Ultimately, real estate aligns best with both our financial objectives and my commitment to fostering a disciplined, collaborative, and resilient company culture.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Review of previous quarter’s investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared factual foundation and identify key takeaways relevant to this quarter’s decision&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because as I reflect on our company’s priorities and the stable market environment, I feel most confident that real estate offers the ideal balance of steady growth and moderate risk for this quarter. Our previous investment in real estate yielded a consistent 10% return, reinforcing its reliability and alignment with our goal of building disciplined investment habits and a collaborative culture. For this round, let’s focus on reviewing our previous quarter’s investment performance and identifying lessons learned, so we can establish a shared factual foundation for our decision today. I encourage everyone to share concrete takeaways from last quarter’s results and how those should inform our approach this quarter. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I welcome your insights on what worked well, what could be improved, and how we can apply those lessons as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to highlight how last quarter’s positive experience with real estate supports both our financial objectives and the trust within our team, while also acknowledging the importance of continually reassessing our options.</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;Our investment in real estate last quarter delivered exactly the kind of steady, predictable return we were aiming for, which I think helped build both our financial base and our confidence as a team. The lesson I take from this is that a disciplined, balanced approach not only supports our growth goals but also strengthens trust and collaboration. As we move into this quarter, I believe we should weigh these outcomes carefully while staying open to any new developments that might shift the risk-return balance among our available options.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I appreciate how you’ve connected our steady financial results to the growth in team confidence and trust. Your emphasis on remaining attentive to shifts in the risk-return balance is valuable, and I agree that maintaining both discipline and openness to new information will help us continue making sound, collaborative decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO&#x27;s response highlights the value of discipline and openness, and I see an opportunity to further integrate the importance of adaptability with the proven benefits of our prior real estate choice, while inviting others to share their perspectives on risk tolerance.</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree that maintaining both discipline and openness will be key as we consider this quarter’s options. Building on our experience, I’d be interested to hear how others are currently weighing the potential risks and returns of real estate compared to stocks, especially since both offer growth but with different volatility profiles. This could help us ensure our decision reflects the full range of shareholder perspectives and risk appetites.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you for raising this, Jasper. Comparing real estate and stocks is especially relevant given their differing volatility and growth profiles; while real estate provided us with steady, moderate returns last quarter, stocks historically offer higher potential gains but also greater risk. I encourage everyone to share their perspectives on how these differences align with our current risk tolerance and what lessons from last quarter might inform our approach to these options now.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s prompt invites a deeper discussion on risk tolerance and lessons learned, and I believe I can help synthesize how our experience with real estate informs our approach to stocks this quarter, while encouraging further input from the group.</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate this framing, Delores. Last quarter’s steady real estate return reinforced the value of reliability for our team, but I recognize that some may see the higher potential of stocks as attractive, especially as our confidence grows. I’m interested in how others view the trade-off between pursuing greater gains and maintaining the stability that’s helped us build trust so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you for articulating this trade-off so clearly, Jasper. I agree that as our confidence grows, it’s natural to consider whether greater risk for potentially higher returns might suit our evolving priorities, but we must also weigh how much we value the stability that’s contributed to our trust and cohesion so far. I’d welcome hearing from others on how they’re balancing these factors as we reflect on last quarter’s results and look ahead to this quarter’s decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s remarks surface a key inflection point for our group, and I believe I can help synthesize the discussion by highlighting how our evolving confidence could justify a gradual shift in risk appetite, while reaffirming the importance of not losing sight of the stability that has grounded our progress.</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I think it’s important that we recognize how our successful experience with real estate has earned us a degree of confidence and cohesion, which could support taking on slightly more risk if the group feels ready. At the same time, I believe we should be intentional about any shift, ensuring that our core values of stability and trust remain central to our decision. I encourage everyone to consider whether our current priorities call for maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate or if we’re prepared to responsibly explore higher-return options like stocks this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for highlighting the importance of intentionality as we consider any shift in our approach. I agree that our experience with real estate has strengthened our foundation, and your point about keeping stability and trust at the center of our decision-making is essential. I’d now like to invite other shareholders to share their reflections on last quarter’s results and how those lessons might shape our risk appetite and asset choice for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Isaac Bates</h4></p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I believe our experience last quarter with real estate reinforced the value of steady, predictable growth, which not only strengthened our financial position but also helped build trust and confidence among the team. This result shows that a disciplined, balanced approach can deliver reliable returns without exposing us to unnecessary risk, which feels especially important as we continue establishing our company’s foundation. While I recognize the potential appeal of higher-return options like stocks, I think it’s wise to consider how much we value the momentum and cohesion we’ve built through our current strategy before making any significant shifts.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. Your emphasis on how steady, reliable growth has supported both our financial position and team confidence is well taken. I agree that, as we reflect on last quarter’s results, it’s important to weigh the value of the momentum and cohesion we’ve built through our disciplined approach before considering any significant shift toward higher-risk options. I welcome additional reflections on how others see this balance as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate your focus on maintaining the momentum and cohesion we’ve built, Delores. At the same time, I think our positive experience last quarter gives us a stronger foundation to thoughtfully assess whether our collective risk appetite is evolving, especially as team confidence grows. I’m interested in hearing if others feel our success with real estate has shifted their view on the appropriate balance between steady growth and higher-return opportunities like stocks for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. I appreciate your point that our positive experience last quarter could provide the confidence needed to reassess our willingness to take on more risk. It’s valuable to consider whether our evolving team dynamic might support exploring higher-return options like stocks, or if maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate is still best for our goals—so I encourage others to share whether their perspectives on this balance have shifted as a result of last quarter’s outcome.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;Building on this, I think it’s important that we remain intentional about any adjustment to our risk profile—using our real estate success as a foundation for open, honest discussion about our comfort with higher-return options like stocks. I’d encourage us to clearly articulate what level of risk feels appropriate now, so we can ensure our next step supports both our financial goals and the trust we’ve established as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. I agree that being intentional about any shift in our risk profile is essential, especially as we build on the foundation of trust and success from last quarter. Your call for clarity around our current comfort level with risk is timely, and I encourage everyone to reflect on what feels most appropriate for our team at this stage—ensuring our next decision continues to support both our growth objectives and the strong sense of trust we’ve developed together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate the emphasis on clarity and intentionality, Delores. As we consider our options—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—I believe it’s essential we openly acknowledge how our recent success has shaped our comfort with risk, while also staying grounded in the steady progress that’s strengthened our team. This way, we can make a decision that not only advances our financial goals but also deepens the trust and cohesion that are becoming hallmarks of our company culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree with both Jasper and Isaac that our investment in real estate last quarter provided the steady, predictable return we needed to build trust and momentum as a team. The reliability of that outcome not only strengthened our financial base but also fostered a sense of confidence and inclusivity in our decision-making process. As we consider our options for this quarter—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—I think it’s essential we continue to prioritize approaches that reinforce disciplined growth and team cohesion, while remaining open to reassessing our risk tolerance as our confidence grows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted both the reliability of last quarter’s outcome and its positive impact on our team’s confidence and inclusivity. Your point about prioritizing disciplined growth while staying open to reassessing our risk tolerance as we progress is well taken, and I encourage others to reflect on how these lessons might shape our approach to this quarter’s investment options.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your encouragement, Delores. Building on the discussion, I think our experience last quarter demonstrates that maintaining a disciplined, steady approach like real estate can serve as a strong foundation—giving us the flexibility to thoughtfully consider higher-return options like stocks if and when our collective confidence supports it. I’d be interested to hear if others feel that our success so far has shifted their view on the right balance between stability and potential growth for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. Your observation that our disciplined approach with real estate has given us the flexibility to consider higher-return options like stocks in the future is insightful. I encourage everyone to reflect on whether our recent success has shifted their view on the optimal balance between stability and growth for this quarter, so we can ensure our decision truly reflects our evolving confidence and priorities as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I think your point raises an important question for us, Delores. While our steady results with real estate have certainly increased our confidence, I believe it’s important that any shift toward higher-return options like stocks is made with full transparency and shared agreement, so we preserve the trust and cohesion that have become central to our team. I look forward to hearing how others are weighing this balance, as I see real value in integrating cautious optimism with the disciplined habits we’ve established.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued that last quarter’s steady 10% return from real estate reinforced both our financial goals and team trust, advocating for a disciplined, balanced approach that supports growth and collaboration. The CEO, Delores Booth, agreed with my emphasis on discipline and openness to new information, valuing my call to weigh risk-return trade-offs carefully.

Other shareholders, including Isaac Bates, Ivan Johnson, Belle Cantu, and Krish Greer, broadly supported the steady, predictable growth achieved through last quarter’s real estate investment, emphasizing its role in strengthening both financial stability and team trust. While acknowledging the appeal of higher-return options like stocks, they collectively stressed the importance of maintaining discipline, intentionality, and transparency when considering any shift in risk profile. The group showed openness to reassessing risk tolerance as confidence grows but agreed that any move toward higher volatility assets should be cautious and consensus-driven. No significant disagreements arose; instead, there was a shared commitment to balancing steady growth with evolving risk appetite while preserving the collaborative culture established so far.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Delores Booth: Supports Real Estate as the ideal balance of steady growth and moderate risk for this quarter, emphasizing discipline and openness to reassessing risk; certain.  <br>
- Jasper Meza (myself): Supports Real Estate for steady growth and trust-building, open to cautious exploration of Stocks if confidence grows; certain.  <br>

CEO Delores Booth clearly favors investing in Real Estate this quarter, citing its steady growth, moderate risk, and alignment with the company’s disciplined investment habits and collaborative culture. She emphasizes maintaining stability and trust as core values while remaining open to reassessing risk tolerance based on shareholder input and evolving confidence. Throughout the discussion, she actively integrates shareholder perspectives, encouraging transparency, intentionality, and open dialogue about potential shifts toward higher-risk options like stocks. Her position remains consistent, showing no significant evolution but rather a balanced approach that values both discipline and adaptability.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Jasper Meza UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 25%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s strong consensus on the value of last quarter’s steady real estate return, the CEO’s emphasis on maintaining discipline and intentionality, and multiple shareholders’ points about how reliable growth has fostered trust and momentum all reinforced my confidence in real estate. The recurring openness to reassessing risk appetite—especially as articulated by myself, Isaac, and Ivan—keeps stocks as a meaningful, though secondary, consideration. The lack of advocacy for bonds or cash, along with the consensus that their lower returns may not support our current momentum, slightly reduced my confidence in those options.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has deepened my appreciation for how our collective experience with real estate has shaped not only our financial results but also our team’s cohesion and confidence. I’m more attuned to the importance of intentional, transparent decision-making as our risk appetite evolves. While my preferred option remains the same, I’m now more conscious of the need to balance openness to change with the stability that has grounded our progress.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the most balanced path for steady, moderate growth while reinforcing the trust and discipline that are becoming hallmarks of our company culture. The group’s shared reflections confirm that our disciplined approach is serving both our financial and cultural objectives well. At the same time, I remain open to carefully considering stocks in future quarters if our collective confidence and risk tolerance increase. For now, real estate aligns best with both our current priorities and the lessons learned from our recent success.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have established a strong factual foundation and broad support for real estate, several shareholders have thoughtfully raised the possibility that our team’s growing confidence could justify reassessing our collective risk appetite. Before moving to a proposal, I believe it is important to explicitly check in on whether anyone’s comfort with risk has shifted and to ensure our investment decision truly reflects both our evolving priorities and company values. Continuing with another round will allow us to clarify our current risk tolerance and confirm that our choice is fully aligned with the team’s perspectives, fostering both transparency and unity.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current risk tolerance and alignment with company values | Expected outcome: Clarify our collective appetite for risk and ensure investment options reflect our team’s priorities for growth, stability, and culture&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I continue to believe that real estate offers the best balance of steady growth and moderate risk for our company at this stage, especially given its proven track record in the current stable market and its role in building team confidence and cohesion. The discussion has highlighted a growing openness to considering stocks as our risk appetite evolves, but the group remains aligned around the value of reliability and disciplined progress. Maintaining our focus on real estate this quarter supports both our financial objectives and the inclusive, trust-based culture we’re cultivating, while leaving room for intentional reassessment in future quarters, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. In this round, let’s assess whether our collective comfort with risk has shifted and how our values around growth, stability, and culture should shape our investment choice. By openly sharing our perspectives, we can ensure that our decision truly reflects the evolving priorities of our team and strengthens our collaborative foundation. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share insights or concerns that might deepen our understanding of the best path forward for our company.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Jasper Meza UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The unanimous support among shareholders for real estate as the optimal choice this quarter, reinforced by the CEO’s emphasis on disciplined growth, stability, and regular self-assessment, has increased my confidence in real estate. The consistent point that real estate’s steady returns have strengthened team trust and discipline was especially compelling. While the openness to stocks as a future option remains, the group’s shared commitment to intentionality and inclusivity in risk reassessment makes me slightly less inclined to advocate for an immediate shift toward higher volatility. The lack of advocacy for bonds and cash, and agreement that their lower returns do not align with our current momentum, further solidified my view.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round deepened my conviction that our disciplined, collaborative approach is serving both our financial and cultural objectives well. I’m more attuned to how regular self-assessment and open dialogue not only safeguard our foundation but also prepare us for future adaptability. My thinking has evolved to more fully appreciate the value of intentional process and inclusivity in maintaining both stability and readiness for change.<br>

For this quarter, maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate is the most prudent and unifying choice.<br>

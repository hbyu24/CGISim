<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my support for Option C, advocating for the full allocation of capital evenly across all four quarters. My position was grounded in the belief that Option C balances growth potential with risk management, fostering disciplined investment habits and promoting shared ownership from the start. During the discussion, I synthesized viewpoints from Jasper Meza, who emphasized momentum and trust-building through Option C, and Belle Cantu, who highlighted the reassurance and flexibility offered by Option A’s cash reserve. CEO Delores Booth positively acknowledged my synthesis, agreeing that our decision must reflect both financial ambitions and team comfort. I chose to contribute strategically in both Round 1 and Round 2 to emphasize the importance of balancing growth with security, and the need for open communication and adaptability regardless of the chosen option. The CEO’s responses reinforced the value of fostering team resilience alongside financial decisions. Ultimately, the group voted unanimously (6/6) in favor of Option C, approving the proposal to allocate 100% of funds evenly across the four quarters. My preferred option was adopted, reflecting a strong consensus around this balanced approach.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting by clearly framing the discussion and encouraging focused, constructive input from all shareholders. Specifically, she skillfully summarized differing viewpoints and emphasized the importance of both financial outcomes and team culture, as seen when she acknowledged the merits of both Options C and A. Her ability to facilitate open dialogue while guiding the group toward consensus was evident, particularly in her thoughtful round summaries and her commitment to ongoing transparency and adaptability. One area for potential improvement could be to invite more explicit feedback earlier in the discussion to surface any less vocal concerns, ensuring all perspectives are fully captured before moving toward consensus. The company’s decision-making process worked effectively in this meeting: it was structured, inclusive, and iterative, allowing shareholders to explore trade-offs deeply and align on both financial and cultural priorities. The unanimous approval of Option C suggests the final decision was well-considered and suitable for the stable market environment, positioning the company for disciplined growth and strong team cohesion.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my understanding that decision-making dynamics in a shareholder context benefit greatly from a balance of analytical rigor and attention to group cohesion. I learned that synthesizing diverse perspectives—especially those emphasizing both growth and security—can facilitate broader consensus and strengthen team alignment. Moving forward, I plan to continue adopting a facilitative approach in meetings, aiming to bridge differing viewpoints with clarity and empathy, which resonates well with my ESFJ style. I also noticed a pattern where shareholders prioritize both financial prudence and cultural factors equally, indicating that future proposals should explicitly address how decisions impact team morale and adaptability alongside numeric outcomes. A key takeaway for me is that successful shareholder engagement hinges not only on advocating for sound financial strategy but also on nurturing trust, communication, and mutual support as foundational elements. This insight will shape my future participation by encouraging me to champion both the quantitative and relational dimensions of our company’s decisions.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate for our inaugural quarter, emphasizing its optimal balance between steady growth and manageable risk within the stable market environment. I stressed how real estate aligns with our company’s goals of disciplined growth, trust-building, and fostering an inclusive team culture. During the discussions, CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, affirming that real estate supports both financial and cultural priorities and appreciating my focus on adaptability and open communication to manage potential liquidity concerns. Other shareholders echoed similar support, and the CEO skillfully integrated these perspectives without disagreement. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of the real estate investment proposal, fully adopting my preferred option. This outcome reflects a strong collective alignment on both the financial rationale and the collaborative culture we seek to build.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by framing the discussions clearly around our market environment and company objectives, encouraging thorough yet focused shareholder participation. For example, she effectively summarized the baseline risk-return profiles in Round 1 and acknowledged liquidity concerns in Round 2, integrating all shareholder input thoughtfully. Her ability to maintain an inclusive and transparent dialogue fostered consensus without suppressing dissent, although inviting more explicit early feedback from less vocal shareholders might enhance future discussions. The company’s decision-making process during this meeting was structured, iterative, and consensus-driven, allowing comprehensive exploration of financial and cultural factors. The final decision to invest in real estate strikes a prudent balance between growth and risk and is well-suited to our stable market context and desire to build a resilient, collaborative company culture. I believe this decision positions the company positively for disciplined progress and cohesive team development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced that achieving consensus in shareholder decisions benefits greatly from synthesizing diverse perspectives with empathy and clarity—an approach well-suited to my ESFJ style. I learned that emphasizing how financial choices impact team culture and adaptability helps unify the group and build trust, which is crucial in early-stage company decisions. Moving forward, I intend to continue facilitating open dialogue by connecting financial reasoning with relational priorities, thereby strengthening group cohesion and shared understanding. I also noticed a clear pattern that shareholders prioritize balanced risk-return profiles aligned with cultural values over pursuing maximal returns alone, indicating that future proposals should explicitly address both financial metrics and team impact. My key takeaway is that successful participation requires advocating not only for sound investment strategies but also for communication norms and adaptive practices that support sustained collaboration. This insight will guide me to champion holistic decision-making and encourage proactive engagement from all shareholders in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate, emphasizing its balanced profile of steady growth and moderate risk, which aligns with our company’s current priorities for stability and confidence-building. Throughout both discussion rounds, I reinforced the connection between last quarter’s reliable 10% return in real estate and the strengthened trust and cohesion within our team. I encouraged ongoing openness to reassessing our risk appetite as our confidence grows, while underscoring the importance of maintaining disciplined investment habits and transparent communication. CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, affirming the value of balancing reliability with thoughtful risk assessment and highlighting the role of regular risk tolerance check-ins to support adaptability and unity. Other shareholders echoed similar views, resulting in unanimous endorsement of real estate for this quarter. The final vote was 6/6 in favor, fully adopting my preferred option and reflecting a strong consensus around continued disciplined growth and team cohesion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by skillfully facilitating inclusive, transparent dialogue that balanced financial analysis with cultural considerations. She effectively framed the meeting’s themes, encouraged shareholder participation, and synthesized diverse perspectives without allowing dissent to stall progress. For example, she acknowledged the merits of both real estate and stocks, fostering openness to future reassessment while steering the group toward a prudent consensus. One area for improvement could be proactively inviting more input from less vocal shareholders earlier in the discussion to ensure all viewpoints are surfaced promptly. The company’s decision-making process worked efficiently, employing a structured, iterative approach that allowed shareholders to explore risks, returns, and cultural impacts deeply before reaching unanimity. The final decision to invest in real estate aligns well with the stable market environment and company values, supporting steady financial growth and strengthening the collaborative culture essential to our long-term success.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the critical role of balancing analytical rigor with relational insight in shareholder decision-making. I learned that emphasizing how financial choices affect team trust and cohesion facilitates broader consensus and strengthens alignment, a dynamic well suited to my ESFJ style. Moving forward, I will continue to act as a facilitator who bridges differing viewpoints with empathy and clarity, ensuring transparent communication remains central. I observed a pattern where shareholders uniformly prioritize stability and disciplined progress at this stage, with openness to gradually exploring higher-risk options like stocks as confidence grows. This insight highlights the importance of regular check-ins on risk tolerance as a mechanism for adaptability. A key takeaway is that successful participation requires advocating for sound financial strategies alongside nurturing communication norms and mutual support. These lessons will guide me to champion holistic decision-making and encourage proactive engagement from all shareholders in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During the Year 1 Q3 investment meeting, I firmly advocated for investing in real estate, consistent with my initial position and confidence distribution. I emphasized real estate’s historical track record of steady, moderate returns in the stable market environment and its alignment with our company’s values of disciplined growth and a trust-based, collaborative culture. Throughout both rounds of discussion, I reinforced the importance of balancing steady progress with ongoing reassessment of our risk tolerance to maintain adaptability as our experience grows. CEO Delores Booth responded positively and affirmatively to my input, acknowledging the close connection I drew between financial outcomes and cultural cohesion, and she valued my emphasis on disciplined progress coupled with openness to change. Other shareholders echoed similar support for real estate, highlighting its consistent moderate returns and cultural benefits. The final voting outcome was unanimous (6/6) approval of the real estate investment proposal, fully adopting my preferred option. This strong consensus reflected shared confidence in real estate as the most prudent investment for this quarter.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by facilitating a structured, inclusive, and transparent decision-making process. She effectively framed the meeting’s themes, encouraged comprehensive shareholder participation, and synthesized diverse perspectives with clarity and respect. Specifically, Delores skillfully integrated financial data with cultural considerations, highlighting the importance of steady growth, disciplined habits, and team cohesion. Her openness to ongoing reassessment of risk tolerance and commitment to adaptability strengthened the group’s confidence and unity. One area for improvement would be to proactively solicit input from less vocal shareholders earlier in the discussion to capture a broader range of views before consensus-building. The company’s decision-making process functioned well this meeting, enabling thorough exploration of options and reinforcing shared priorities. The final decision to invest in real estate was sound and well-aligned with both the stable market conditions and the company’s collaborative culture, positioning the firm for sustainable growth and resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reaffirmed for me the critical importance of blending analytical rigor with attention to relational dynamics in shareholder decision-making. I learned that consistently linking financial performance to team values—such as trust, discipline, and cohesion—facilitates broader consensus and strengthens collective commitment. I also noted the group’s unanimous preference for steady, moderate-risk investments at this stage, coupled with an openness to revisit risk tolerance regularly as experience accumulates. Moving forward, I intend to deepen my facilitative approach by explicitly encouraging regular reassessment of risk preferences and fostering open dialogue among all shareholders, including those less forthcoming. A clear pattern emerged showing that shareholders value an investment strategy that balances reliability with adaptability, which I will leverage to help predict and guide future outcomes. Key takeaways include the necessity of maintaining transparent communication, embedding risk tolerance check-ins into our process, and championing holistic decisions that integrate financial objectives with cultural priorities. These insights will inform my future participation and contribution to building our company’s enduring success.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q4</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q4</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for investing in real estate, emphasizing its consistent track record of steady, moderate returns and its alignment with our company’s values of disciplined growth and collaborative culture in the stable market environment. Throughout both rounds of discussion, I reinforced the importance of balancing financial objectives with team cohesion and trust, highlighting that real estate’s performance has supported both. CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, affirming the connection I made between steady financial results and team unity, and endorsing the need for disciplined progress alongside openness to future reassessment. Other shareholders echoed my views, contributing similar endorsements of real estate’s suitability given its moderate risk and positive cultural impact.

CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>

She skillfully summarized shareholder input, acknowledged the importance of predictability and team trust, and encouraged openness to differing perspectives without losing focus on consensus-building. Her emphasis on regular reassessment of risk tolerance and inclusivity helped ensure the decision-making process was robust and representative. One area for growth would be proactively encouraging earlier input from less vocal shareholders to surface any quieter concerns. Overall, the company’s decision-making process functioned efficiently, balancing analytical rigor with relational insight, and the unanimous approval of real estate reflects a sound choice that supports both financial stability and cultural resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my understanding that effective shareholder decision-making requires harmonizing financial prudence with attention to team dynamics and values, an approach well-aligned with my ESFJ personality. I learned that explicitly linking investment choices to their cultural impact helps build consensus and foster trust. Moving forward, I plan to continue facilitating open, empathetic dialogue that bridges diverse perspectives and encourages everyone’s voice, particularly quieter members, to be heard early. I noticed a clear pattern that shareholders currently prioritize steady, moderate-risk investments aligned with our collaborative culture, while remaining open to reassessing risk tolerance over time to adapt as confidence grows. My key takeaway is that successful participation depends not only on advocating sound financial strategies but also on nurturing transparent communication and shared discipline, which will shape my approach in future meetings to support both the company’s growth and its cultural cohesion.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Annual Review Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>&quot;Welcome to our annual review meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for your participation and commitment throughout this year.</p><p>During year 1, we operated in a stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>We began the year with $100000.00 in assets and ended with $105062.50, representing a 5.06% change in our company&#x27;s value.</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>

  Best option was stocks with 20.0% return (would have yielded $5000.00)<br>
Quarter 2: We invested $25625.00 in real_estate for a return of $0.00 (0.0%)<br>
  Best option was bonds with 5.0% return (would have yielded $1281.25)<br>
Quarter 3: We invested $25625.00 in real_estate for a return of $2562.50 (10.0%)<br>

Quarter 4: We invested $26265.62 in real_estate for a return of $2626.56 (10.0%)<br>

<h3>Krish Greer&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Krish Greer CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Consistently facilitated structured, inclusive discussions that encouraged thorough participation from all shareholders, as demonstrated in both the annual budget and quarterly investment meetings.<br>
- Clearly articulated the rationale behind each investment proposal, integrating both financial data and cultural considerations, which helped build consensus and trust within the group.</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could further enhance inclusivity by proactively inviting input from less vocal shareholders earlier in each discussion to ensure all perspectives are surfaced before moving toward consensus.<br>
- Would benefit from more explicitly addressing alternative strategies or scenario planning, especially in quarters where real estate underperformed or other assets outperformed.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained a disciplined, consensus-driven investment approach throughout the year, resulting in steady returns and reinforcing a collaborative, trust-based culture.<br>
- Demonstrated strong alignment between investment decisions and the company’s stated strategy of balancing growth with risk management in a stable market environment.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 54.8% of the maximum possible returns this year, indicating opportunities were missed by not considering a more dynamic allocation in response to market signals, particularly in quarters where stocks or bonds outperformed.<br>
- Reliance on a single asset class (real estate) may have limited our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize returns.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. How do you plan to incorporate more proactive scenario analysis or alternative asset consideration into our decision-making process next year to maximize returns while maintaining our cultural values?<br>
2. What specific steps will you take to ensure quieter or less vocal shareholders are engaged earlier and more fully in future discussions?</p><p></p><p><h2>CEO Response to Evaluations</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth responded to the evaluations and questions:</p><p>&quot;Delores Booth Thank you all for your thoughtful, candid, and constructive feedback. I deeply appreciate the time and care you’ve each invested in reflecting on both our company’s performance and my leadership over this first year. Your insights are invaluable as we strive to build not just a successful investment company, but a resilient, inclusive, and high-performing team. Let me address your feedback and questions in detail, and share my reflections and commitments for the year ahead.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. Feedback Themes: Common Strengths and Areas for Growth</h3></p><p>**a. Strengths:**<br>
- **Structured, Inclusive Leadership:** Across all evaluations, you recognized the value of our structured, theme-driven discussions and my commitment to clear, transparent communication. I am grateful that my efforts to synthesize shareholder perspectives, articulate rationales, and foster an environment of trust and collaboration have contributed to our team’s cohesion and decision quality.<br>
- **Disciplined, Values-Driven Decision-Making:** There is broad agreement that our steady, consensus-driven approach—particularly our disciplined investment in real estate—reinforced both financial stability and a strong, trust-based culture. Unanimous votes and thoughtful participation were hallmarks of our process this year.</p><p>**b. Areas for Improvement:**<br>
- **Earlier and Broader Engagement:** Many of you noted that I could more proactively encourage input from quieter or less vocal shareholders, especially early in each cycle, to ensure a wider range of perspectives shapes our decisions before consensus forms.<br>
- **Scenario Planning and Adaptability:** Several of you highlighted the need for more dynamic scenario analysis, contingency planning, and explicit exploration of alternative asset classes. While our approach was steady and values-aligned, we missed opportunities to maximize returns and test our adaptability in the face of evolving market data.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. Responses to Shareholder Questions</h3></p><p>**Isaac Bates:**<br>
1. **Dynamic Scenario Planning &amp; Contingencies:** Next year, I will introduce a formal scenario planning segment at the start of each investment cycle. This will include structured discussions on best-case, worst-case, and alternative market scenarios—even if current conditions appear stable. We will also establish contingency “playbooks” for rapid response should market signals shift unexpectedly.<br>
2. **Earlier, More Diverse Input:** I will implement a rotating “first voice” approach, systematically inviting each shareholder to open discussions in turn, ensuring early input from every perspective. Additionally, I will send out pre-meeting prompts to surface concerns or ideas before our formal sessions begin.</p><p>**Ivan Johnson:**<br>
1. **Encouraging Diverse Viewpoints:** I will adopt a round-robin format in early discussion rounds, explicitly inviting each shareholder to share their perspective before group dialogue begins. I will also pause after initial inputs to actively solicit dissenting or alternative views before consensus-building.<br>
2. **Recognizing Market Opportunities:** Each quarter, we will review not only historical performance but also emerging trends and “what-if” analyses for each asset. I will designate time in each meeting for open debate on alternative strategies, and we will pilot a “devil’s advocate” role to stress-test our preferred options.</p><p>**Jasper Meza:**<br>
1. **Balancing Discipline and Opportunity:** While I remain committed to disciplined, consensus-driven decisions, I will champion a more flexible approach when market data points toward outsized opportunities. This may include setting pre-agreed thresholds for considering higher-return, higher-risk assets and revisiting our risk appetite more frequently.<br>
2. **Earlier, More Diverse Input on Alternatives:** I will introduce structured brainstorming segments focused specifically on alternative assets at the outset of each cycle, ensuring every shareholder’s view on diversification and opportunity is actively sought before proposals are drafted.</p><p>**Belle Cantu:**<br>
1. **Structured Risk Tolerance Check-Ins:** We will institute regular, explicit check-ins on individual and group risk tolerance at the start of each quarter and after major market developments. Anonymous polls or written reflections may supplement verbal check-ins to surface evolving comfort levels before consensus forms.<br>
2. **Active Exploration of Alternatives and Concentration Risk:** I will ensure that every investment discussion includes a dedicated review of alternative asset classes, their risks, and missed opportunities. We will also periodically assess our portfolio’s concentration risk and document our rationale for diversification—or lack thereof.</p><p>**Krish Greer:**<br>
1. **Proactive Scenario Analysis and Alternatives:** Each investment cycle will begin with a scenario planning module, where we map out plausible market shifts and discuss how alternative assets might perform. I will also assign a rotating “alternative asset champion” to present the case for non-core investments each quarter.<br>
2. **Engaging Quieter Shareholders:** I will reach out to less vocal shareholders in advance of meetings and encourage them to prepare opening remarks or questions. During meetings, I will pause discussion after each major theme to explicitly invite input from those who have not yet spoken.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. Leadership Self-Assessment</h3></p><p>- **Leadership Effectiveness:** I am proud of my ability to guide our team through structured, inclusive, and values-driven decision processes. The unanimous votes and open participation reflect a strong foundation of trust and clarity. However, I recognize the need to be even more proactive in inviting diverse perspectives and surfacing dissent earlier.<br>
- **Decision Quality:** Our decisions were prudent, well-reasoned, and aligned with available data and our stated risk tolerance. That said, I acknowledge that a more dynamic approach could have increased our returns in certain quarters.<br>
- **Communication Clarity:** I believe my summaries, proposals, and meeting facilitation were clear, thorough, and responsive to shareholder concerns. I will continue to refine my ability to distill complex input into actionable insights.<br>
- **Responsiveness to Input:** I have consistently sought to integrate shareholder feedback and concerns into our decisions. Still, I can improve by more actively seeking out less obvious or dissenting viewpoints and ensuring they are fully considered.<br>
- **Adaptability:** While I maintained steady leadership and a clear direction, I see room to enhance our adaptability, particularly in responding to changing market conditions and emerging opportunities.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>4. Company Performance Assessment</h3></p><p>- **Financial Results:** We achieved steady growth and preserved capital, but captured only 54.8% of the maximum possible returns. Our cautious, disciplined approach protected against downside but left some upside unrealized.<br>
- **Risk Management:** Our focus on real estate provided moderate, predictable returns and supported team trust. However, our lack of diversification increased concentration risk and limited our ability to learn from alternative strategies.<br>
- **Strategic Alignment:** Our decisions were highly consistent with our stated strategy of steady growth and risk management in a stable market. We could have been more opportunistic when data signaled outsized returns elsewhere.<br>
- **Capital Utilization:** We fully deployed our capital as planned, maximizing engagement and building disciplined investment habits.<br>
- **Market Responsiveness:** While we regularly reviewed performance, we did not pivot as quickly as we might have when market signals changed. This is an area for deliberate improvement next year.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>5. Future Direction: Commitments and Improvements</h3></p><p>**1. Proactive Scenario Planning and Contingency Strategies:**  <br>
We will introduce structured scenario planning and contingency playbooks at the start of each investment cycle, ensuring we are prepared for both expected and unexpected shifts in market conditions.</p><p>**2. Earlier, Broader, and More Diverse Shareholder Engagement:**  <br>
I will implement systematic early input solicitation, including rotating first-voice invitations, pre-meeting prompts, and targeted outreach to quieter shareholders. Structured brainstorming on alternative assets will occur before proposals are drafted.</p><p>**3. Explicit Exploration of Alternatives and Risk Tolerance:**  <br>
Every investment cycle will include a dedicated review of alternative asset classes, open debate on diversification, and explicit, regular check-ins on individual and group risk tolerance—both verbally and in writing.</p><p>---</p><p>**In closing,** I want to thank each of you for your partnership, candor, and commitment to our shared success. I am proud of what we have built together—a company grounded in trust, collaboration, and disciplined progress. At the same time, I am energized by your feedback and fully committed to evolving our approach to capture more opportunities, foster deeper engagement, and ensure our decisions remain both sound and inclusive.</p><p>Let’s move forward into the coming year with renewed focus, openness, and unity—ready to adapt, learn, and grow together.</p><p>Thank you.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Performance Ratings</h2></p><p><br>

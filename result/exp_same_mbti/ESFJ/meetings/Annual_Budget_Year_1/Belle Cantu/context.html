<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p>No previous meeting reflections found for annual budget Year 1</p><p><br>
<h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome everyone to our annual budget meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for joining today.</p><p>Our company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>As this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    The today, we need to decide how we&#x27;ll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:</p><p>    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).<br>
    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.<br>
    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).<br>
    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.</p><p>    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.</p><p>    The objective of today&#x27;s meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company&#x27;s interests in this stable market environment. We&#x27;ll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, then I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we&#x27;ll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Belle Cantu CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 40%<br>
- Option B: 25%<br>
- Option C: 30%<br>
- Option D: 5%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option A<br>
REASONING: As someone who values stability, responsibility, and the well-being of everyone involved, I feel most confident in a cautious approach for our first year. Option A allows us to participate in market growth while maintaining a significant cash reserve, reducing risk if conditions unexpectedly change. Even distribution also appeals to my preference for organization and fairness, ensuring no single quarter is overexposed. While Option C is appealing for growth, I believe starting conservatively will help us build trust and confidence as a team before taking on greater risk.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because I feel most comfortable with Option C as it allows us to fully utilize our available capital in a stable and predictable market, maximizing our growth potential while spreading risk evenly across all quarters. As someone who values harmony and security for the group, I want to make sure we are not exposing ourselves to unnecessary risk, but also not holding back our collective progress. This round, I’d like us to focus on an initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions, aiming to establish a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities each option presents. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share any perspectives or considerations that might help us deepen our collective understanding as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I see Option C as the most balanced choice for our current situation—by allocating our full capital evenly, we maximize our growth potential without taking on unnecessary risk in any single quarter. Option A and B are more conservative, which could limit our returns given the predictability of the market this year, while Option D introduces more risk by concentrating a larger portion of our funds later in the year, which I feel is unnecessary in such a stable environment. I’m interested to hear how others weigh these trade-offs, but for now, I believe Option C gives us the best foundation for steady progress.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I appreciate how you&#x27;ve articulated the balance between growth potential and risk management in Option C, especially in light of the stable market conditions. Your point about avoiding unnecessary concentration of risk later in the year with Option D is well taken, and I agree that a steady, even approach gives us a solid foundation as we start out.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;Thank you, Delores. I’d also like to emphasize that by committing fully and consistently from the start, Option C helps us develop disciplined investment habits and reinforces our shared commitment to the company’s growth. This steady approach can build trust among us as shareholders and set a positive precedent for future decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for emphasizing the importance of consistency and trust-building as we establish our company’s investment culture. I agree that setting a disciplined precedent from the outset not only supports our financial objectives but also strengthens our shared commitment as a team. This perspective adds meaningful depth to our assessment of Option C’s advantages.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Belle Cantu</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help highlight the importance of balancing growth with caution, especially as we are just starting out and have no historical data.</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I appreciate the points raised about maximizing growth and building trust through consistent investment, especially in a stable market. At the same time, I feel it’s important to consider the value of maintaining a cash reserve in our first year, as in Option A, to ensure we have flexibility if conditions unexpectedly change. This approach could help us build confidence as a team while still participating in market opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle, for highlighting the importance of flexibility and the reassurance that comes with maintaining a cash reserve, especially as we navigate our first year. Your point about building team confidence by balancing participation with caution is well taken, and I agree that Option A’s more conservative stance could provide additional security if unexpected changes arise. This is a helpful reminder to weigh not only growth potential but also our collective comfort with risk as we establish our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully acknowledges the importance of balancing growth and security, and I see an opportunity to further integrate the perspectives on team confidence and disciplined investment. By connecting the value of a cash reserve with the trust-building aspect of steady participation, I can help deepen our shared understanding of how these priorities might complement each other.</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I appreciate your thoughtful response, Delores. I believe that by starting with a conservative allocation like Option A, we can build our confidence as a team while also establishing disciplined investment habits. This balance between security and participation may help us set a strong foundation for both trust and long-term growth in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I appreciate how you’ve connected the conservative allocation in Option A to both team confidence and the development of disciplined investment habits. Your emphasis on balancing security with participation is a thoughtful reminder that our first-year approach should support both our financial growth and our group’s cohesion. This helps us further clarify the strengths of Option A as we consider all options collectively.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s comments reinforce the importance of group cohesion and disciplined habits, and I see value in acknowledging how both Option A and Option C reflect our shared priorities in different ways. By highlighting this, I can help the group synthesize the best elements of both approaches and support a more unified decision-making process.</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I agree that both Option A and Option C reflect our commitment to responsible growth, just with different emphases on caution and opportunity. Recognizing that our shared priorities include both team trust and steady progress, I think it’s important we continue weighing these options in light of how they support our company culture as well as our financial goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I appreciate how Jasper highlighted the disciplined growth and trust-building that come with Option C’s even allocation, and I also see merit in Belle’s emphasis on the reassurance and flexibility of Option A. In a stable market, I feel Option C allows us to fully participate in growth opportunities while spreading risk, but I also recognize the comfort that a cash reserve can bring as we build our foundation. Ultimately, I think our decision should reflect both our appetite for steady progress and our desire for security as new partners, and I’m open to hearing more about how others weigh these priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for articulating the balance between pursuing steady growth with Option C and valuing the security offered by Option A. Your summary underscores the importance of aligning our decision with both our financial ambitions and our need for reassurance as a new team. I agree that hearing from more shareholders will help us ensure our chosen approach reflects the full spectrum of our group’s priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate the emphasis on both disciplined growth and maintaining flexibility that’s come through in this discussion. In a stable market, I see Option C as the most inclusive and balanced approach—it allows us to fully participate in growth while evenly spreading our exposure, which feels fair and reassuring for everyone involved. At the same time, I recognize the value in Option A’s caution, but I feel our current environment gives us a unique opportunity to build confidence together by committing more fully from the start.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the inclusivity and fairness of Option C, especially in the context of a stable market where we can confidently commit to growth together. Your acknowledgment of Option A’s caution is a helpful reminder that our decision should balance both opportunity and collective reassurance, and your perspective brings us closer to a well-rounded understanding of the best path forward for our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate how this discussion is surfacing both our collective appetite for growth and our desire for reassurance. By openly considering the merits of both Option C’s full participation and Option A’s caution, I believe we’re fostering a culture of trust and shared responsibility—which, in itself, will be a valuable asset as we move forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I agree that fostering a culture of trust and shared responsibility is just as vital as the technical merits of any allocation strategy. Your reflection highlights how our open, balanced discussion is laying the groundwork for both strong financial decisions and a collaborative team dynamic as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree that the way we engage in this decision is setting a powerful precedent—not just for our investment outcomes, but for how we work together as a team. Whether we ultimately choose Option C or a more cautious path, our shared commitment to open dialogue and balanced risk-taking will serve us well as we navigate future decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Isaac Bates</h4></p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate how the discussion has highlighted both the value of steady, full participation in Option C and the reassurance offered by the more conservative approach in Option A. In a stable market, I see Option C as giving us the best chance to build momentum and trust as a team by engaging everyone equally from the outset, while still managing risk through even distribution across quarters. At the same time, I recognize that the security of a cash reserve in Option A could bring comfort as we establish our foundation, so I’m interested in hearing how others weigh the importance of flexibility versus maximizing early growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac, for summarizing the key considerations so clearly—your focus on balancing momentum and trust with the reassurance of flexibility is central to our decision. I agree that in a stable market, Option C’s even participation offers strong potential for both growth and team cohesion, but your point about the comfort of a cash reserve in Option A is an important one as we build our foundation. I look forward to hearing how others weigh these priorities, as their insights will help us arrive at the approach that best supports both our financial goals and our group’s sense of security.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;Thank you, Delores. I think it’s clear from our discussion that both Option C and Option A resonate with our priorities, just in different ways—Option C for its proactive, team-driven momentum, and Option A for its emphasis on foundational security. As we continue, I’d encourage us to consider not only which option offers the best financial outcome, but also which approach will most effectively build our collective confidence and set the tone for our company culture in this important first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted that both Option C and Option A reflect our group’s priorities, though with different emphases on momentum versus foundational security. Your point about considering which approach will best foster collective confidence and set a positive tone for our company culture is especially valuable as we move forward—this holistic perspective will be key as we continue weighing our options together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate your focus on the holistic impact of our decision, Delores. As we weigh Option C’s momentum against Option A’s security, I think it’s helpful to reflect on how our choice will influence not only our results this year but also our ability to collaborate confidently in future decisions. By clarifying which priorities matter most to us now, we can lay a strong foundation for both performance and partnership as our company grows.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth summarized: &quot;Delores Booth 1. Round Theme and Objective  <br>
This round focused on our initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions, with the objective of establishing a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with each option.</p><p>2. Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders  <br>
- **Option C (full, even allocation):**  <br>
  - *Supporters:* Jasper Meza, Ivan Johnson, Delores Booth (myself)  <br>
  - *Rationale:* Maximizes growth potential in a stable market by fully utilizing available capital and evenly distributing risk across all quarters. Seen as balanced, inclusive, and conducive to disciplined investment habits.  <br>
- **Option A (conservative, even allocation):**  <br>
  - *Supporters:* Belle Cantu (primary), with acknowledgment from Krish Greer and Isaac Bates  <br>
  - *Rationale:* Maintains a cash reserve for flexibility and reassurance, especially valued in our first year. Emphasizes foundational security and gradual confidence-building as a team.  <br>
- **Acknowledgement of Both Options:**  <br>
  - Krish Greer and Isaac Bates recognized merits in both Option C (momentum, growth, trust-building) and Option A (security, flexibility, foundational confidence).  <br>
- **Other Options:**  <br>
  - Options B and D were mentioned briefly, with consensus that they are less aligned with our current needs—Option B being conservative but less discussed, Option D seen as unnecessarily risky in a stable market.</p><p>3. Arguments and Evidence Presented  <br>
- For **Option C**:  <br>
  - Full participation builds disciplined habits and trust.  <br>
  - Even allocation spreads risk and supports steady progress.  <br>
  - Inclusive and fair, aligning with team-based values.  <br>
- For **Option A**:  <br>
  - Cash reserve provides flexibility if market conditions change.  <br>
  - Security and reassurance are important for a new team.  <br>
  - Conservative approach helps establish trust and discipline.  <br>
- For **Option D**:  <br>
  - Concentrates risk later in the year, seen as unnecessary in a stable environment.  <br>
- For **Option B**:  <br>
  - Conservative, but received minimal discussion.</p><p>4. Areas of Consensus and Disagreement  <br>
- **Consensus:**  <br>
  - The market is stable, making balanced or cautious strategies most appropriate.  <br>
  - Both Option C and Option A align with our group’s priorities—Option C for growth and momentum, Option A for security and flexibility.  <br>
  - Importance of building trust, discipline, and a positive company culture.  <br>
- **Disagreement:**  <br>
  - Degree of risk to accept in the first year: some prefer full allocation for momentum (Option C), others prefer holding reserves for security (Option A).</p><p>5. Progress Toward Addressing the Theme  <br>
We have established a clear, shared understanding of the relative risks and opportunities for each budget allocation strategy in the context of a stable market. The discussion has surfaced strong support for both Option C and Option A, with most shareholders gravitating toward these choices and thoughtfully weighing the trade-offs between growth potential and foundational security.</p><p>6. Reiteration of Valid Options  <br>
As a reminder, we must select from our predefined options: Option A, Option B, Option C, or Option D. All discussion has remained focused on these choices.</p><p>7. Next Steps  <br>
In the next round, we will evaluate the long-term implications of each approach, considering which strategy best balances immediate returns with year-long flexibility. I encourage everyone to continue reflecting on how each option supports both our financial objectives and the company culture we wish to build as we move forward together.&quot;</p><p><br>

As Belle Cantu, I argued for a cautious and balanced approach favoring Option A, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a cash reserve to provide flexibility and build team confidence during our first year without historical data. CEO Delores Booth acknowledged and appreciated this focus on security and flexibility, agreeing that Option A’s conservative stance offers reassurance amid uncertainty. We found agreement on the need to balance growth with caution, with the CEO valuing how my perspective complemented the broader discussion on disciplined investment habits and team cohesion. While the CEO personally leaned toward Option C for full participation, she recognized the merits of my argument and the importance of foundational security as part of our collective decision-making. Our exchange helped clarify that both growth and risk management are key priorities to consider moving forward.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
Other shareholders largely supported either Option C or Option A, reflecting a balance between growth and caution. Jasper Meza strongly advocated for Option C, emphasizing full capital utilization with even distribution to maximize growth and build disciplined investment habits. Ivan Johnson and Isaac Bates echoed this view, highlighting Option C’s inclusivity, fairness, and momentum-building potential, while also acknowledging the value of Option A’s caution. Krish Greer and Isaac Bates recognized merits in both options, stressing the need to balance steady progress with security and foundational confidence. There was consensus that Options B and D were less suitable, with Option D seen as unnecessarily risky, and overall, the group agreed on the importance of aligning investment strategy with both financial goals and company culture despite differing risk tolerances.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
CEO Delores Booth: Supports Option C, favoring full, even allocation for growth and risk balance; confidence: certain.  <br>
Jasper Meza: Supports Option C, emphasizing disciplined habits and steady progress; confidence: certain.  <br>
Belle Cantu (myself): Supports Option A, prioritizing caution, cash reserve, and team confidence; confidence: certain.  <br>
Krish Greer: Leans toward Option C but acknowledges merits of Option A’s caution and flexibility; confidence: likely.  <br>
Ivan Johnson: Supports Option C for inclusivity and growth, while recognizing Option A’s caution; confidence: likely.  <br>
Isaac Bates: Balances support between Option C’s momentum and Option A’s security; confidence: likely.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Delores Booth clearly favors Option C, advocating for full utilization of available capital with even distribution to maximize growth potential while managing risk in a stable market. She emphasizes harmony, security, and disciplined investment habits as key benefits of this approach. Throughout the discussion, she acknowledges and appreciates shareholder input supporting both Option C and the more cautious Option A, showing openness to the value of flexibility and team confidence. Her position remains consistent, though she integrates others’ perspectives to highlight how both growth and caution can complement the company’s goals. Overall, the CEO balances her preference for Option C with recognition of foundational security concerns raised by shareholders.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Belle Cantu UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 35%<br>
- Option B: 15%<br>
- Option C: 45%<br>
- Option D: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The repeated emphasis by the CEO, Jasper, and Ivan on Option C’s ability to fully utilize our capital for steady, disciplined growth in a stable market has increased my appreciation for its inclusivity and trust-building potential. The group’s consensus that both Option C and Option A align with our core priorities—growth and foundational security—reinforces my belief that either could serve us well, but the strong case for early momentum and even risk distribution in Option C is compelling. Krish and Isaac’s recognition of the need to balance steady progress with the comfort of a cash reserve also validated my initial caution, but the overall group energy leans toward proactive participation.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become more aware of how foundational trust and disciplined habits can be fostered not only by caution but also by shared commitment and consistency. While my inclination toward security remains, the group’s thoughtful arguments for full participation have helped me see how Option C can also support team confidence and responsible growth. I’m learning to weigh collective momentum and inclusivity more heavily alongside my natural preference for flexibility.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: After integrating the group’s insights, I see that Option C offers a strong foundation for both financial growth and positive team culture in a stable market. While I still value the reassurance of a cash reserve, the benefits of full, even participation—including trust-building, disciplined habits, and inclusivity—are especially appealing as we establish our company’s identity. The consensus around Option C’s advantages, coupled with the low-risk environment, makes me confident that this approach will help us grow together while maintaining a responsible balance.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we have made meaningful progress in clarifying the relative strengths of Options A and C, there remains a significant divergence regarding the optimal balance between immediate growth and foundational security. Several shareholders have articulated strong and thoughtful positions on both sides, and the group has yet to fully evaluate the long-term implications of each approach—particularly how our chosen allocation will affect our ability to adapt throughout the year and shape our company culture moving forward. I believe that one more round of focused discussion, centered on these long-term considerations, will help us address remaining uncertainties, foster a stronger consensus, and ensure that our final decision is both well-informed and fully supported by the team.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Evaluating the long-term implications of different allocation approaches in the current market | Expected outcome: Identify which strategy best balances immediate returns with year-long flexibility&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because I continue to prefer Option C because it offers the most balanced approach to growth and risk in a stable market, fostering disciplined investment habits and inclusivity from the outset. However, I have increased my confidence in Option A due to the persuasive arguments about the security and flexibility a cash reserve can provide for a new team. I am mindful that our decision should support both our financial objectives and our team’s confidence, and I am open to further discussion as we evaluate the long-term implications of each option, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. In this round, we will focus on evaluating how each allocation strategy might impact our immediate returns and our ability to remain flexible throughout the year, considering both financial and cultural effects. I encourage everyone to share insights that may help us see the long-term benefits or limitations of each approach, so we can build a more complete picture together. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>

Krish Greer: &quot;I continue to see Option C as the most balanced choice for our situation, since evenly deploying our full capital allows us to maximize opportunities in this stable market while building disciplined habits and a sense of shared ownership from the very beginning. At the same time, I recognize that Option A’s reserve could provide extra reassurance if unexpected circumstances arise, which is especially meaningful in our first year.

CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish. I appreciate how you’ve articulated the balance between maximizing opportunities through full engagement with Option C and the reassurance that Option A’s reserve could provide in uncertain moments.

Krish Greer: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our decision will shape resilience and cohesion within the team. As we weigh Option C’s momentum against Option A’s reassurance, I think it’s worth considering how our initial approach will set expectations for collaboration and support in future years. Whichever option we choose, I believe prioritizing strong communication and mutual confidence will be just as important as the numbers themselves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish. I agree that the approach we choose now will influence not only our financial outcomes this year, but also the expectations we set for collaboration and mutual support in the years ahead.

Krish Greer: &quot;I agree, and I think one of our greatest strengths as a team is our willingness to engage openly and support each other, regardless of which option we ultimately select. By keeping these values at the center of our decision—whether we lean toward Option C’s active participation or Option A’s cautious flexibility—I’m confident we’ll set a strong foundation for both our company’s growth and our long-term partnership.&quot;</p><p><br>

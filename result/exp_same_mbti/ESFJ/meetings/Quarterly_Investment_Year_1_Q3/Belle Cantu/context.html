*Belle Cantu (Shareholder, ESFJ)*</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>In this meeting, I initially advocated for Option A, emphasizing a conservative, even allocation strategy that maintains a 50% cash reserve to provide flexibility and build team confidence during our first year without historical data. I stressed the importance of balancing growth with caution, highlighting how a cash reserve aligns with our collective need for security as a new team. CEO Delores Booth responded appreciatively, recognizing the value of flexibility and team reassurance that Option A offers, even as she personally favored Option C.</p><p>Throughout the discussion, I engaged actively to synthesize perspectives, acknowledging the merits of Option C’s full participation and steady growth potential while still underscoring the importance of foundational security. My exchanges with the CEO and other shareholders helped clarify how both options reflect our shared priorities—growth, trust, and team cohesion—though with different emphases.</p><p>As the meeting progressed, I adjusted my confidence distribution, increasing support for Option C as the group’s consensus for full, even allocation grew stronger, while still valuing the reassurance of Option A. Ultimately, I voted in favor of Option C when the vote was called, aligning myself with the unanimous approval of the proposal. The final company decision adopted Option C, allocating 100% of funds evenly across all four quarters.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>**What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
Delores Booth skillfully facilitated the discussion by setting clear themes for each round and encouraging shareholders to focus on predefined options. She demonstrated openness to diverse viewpoints, thoughtfully acknowledging the merits of both cautious and growth-oriented approaches. For example, she validated my concerns about flexibility and team confidence while articulating her preference for Option C’s disciplined investment habits and full engagement. Her summaries were comprehensive and balanced, integrating financial and cultural considerations and reinforcing shared values like transparency and mutual support.</p><p>**What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
While the CEO’s facilitation was strong, a more proactive invitation for quieter shareholders to share their views might have enriched the discussion further. Additionally, explicitly addressing any lingering concerns about risks associated with full capital deployment could have preempted uncertainty, especially from more cautious members.</p><p>**Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
The process was collaborative, transparent, and well-structured. The CEO’s framing of discussion themes and emphasis on collective values fostered open dialogue and trust among shareholders. The iterative rounds allowed for reflection and adjustment of positions, culminating in a clear consensus. The balance between financial analysis and team culture considerations was a notable strength.</p><p>**Final Decision Evaluation:**  <br>
Adopting Option C appears well-suited to the company’s stable market environment and team dynamics. It maximizes growth potential while promoting disciplined habits and inclusivity, which are vital for building momentum and trust. Given the unanimous vote and shared commitment to open communication and adaptability, this decision positions the company for both financial success and strong culture development.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>**Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
I learned that balancing financial strategy with cultural and interpersonal factors is crucial, especially in a new team setting. The process showed how openness to others’ perspectives and willingness to reassess initial positions can facilitate consensus without compromising core values. The interplay between risk appetite and the need for reassurance shaped a productive dialogue, highlighting the importance of trust and communication.</p><p>**Adjusting Future Approach:**  <br>
In future meetings, I plan to continue engaging proactively, offering perspectives that bridge caution and opportunity to foster shared understanding. I will also seek to encourage participation from all members to ensure diverse views are heard. Recognizing when to adapt my stance based on collective insights will remain a priority, as will emphasizing common values that unify the group.</p><p>**Patterns &amp; Predictive Insights:**  <br>
I noticed that appeals to team cohesion, trust-building, and disciplined habits are persuasive in this shareholder group, particularly when tied to financial rationale</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>**Belle Cantu’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q1**</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my position in favor of investing in real estate for the inaugural quarter. From the outset, I emphasized real estate’s balanced risk-return profile, highlighting its moderate risk and steady appreciation as critical to fostering both financial momentum and team confidence in this stable market environment. I underscored the importance of responsible planning and prudence while recognizing the need for growth and building collaborative investment habits.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded warmly and affirmatively to my input, explicitly appreciating how I integrated financial and cultural priorities. She reinforced the shared values of teamwork, adaptability, and trust that I emphasized, which strengthened the collective rationale for choosing real estate.</p><p>Throughout the two rounds of discussion, all shareholders—including myself—expressed unanimous support for real estate. We also acknowledged potential liquidity concerns associated with this asset class, but collectively affirmed confidence that these could be managed effectively through our quarterly allocation strategy and open communication.</p><p>When the proposal to invest 100% of the quarter’s funds into real estate was presented, I voted to approve it. The voting outcome was unanimous (6/6), confirming real estate as the final company decision. My preferred option was fully adopted, reflecting strong alignment between my position and the team&#x27;s consensus.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>**What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
Delores Booth excelled in facilitating a structured, focused discussion that balanced financial analysis with cultural considerations. Her clear framing of discussion themes and encouragement for inclusive dialogue helped surface key priorities and concerns. For example, she adeptly synthesized shareholder inputs regarding real estate’s benefits and liquidity considerations, fostering mutual understanding. Her affirming responses to my contributions, which linked financial prudence with team culture, demonstrated strong responsiveness and leadership.</p><p>**What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
While the CEO’s facilitation was excellent, there remains room to more actively encourage input from quieter shareholders to ensure all perspectives are surfaced early. Additionally, proactively addressing potential objections—such as liquidity risks—earlier in the process could help mitigate concerns sooner and deepen confidence before final voting.</p><p>**Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
The process was highly collaborative, transparent, and well-structured, enabling iterative reflection on both data and shared values. The CEO’s thematic guidance and emphasis on collective goals fostered trust and inclusivity. We effectively integrated financial risk-return analysis with cultural priorities like trust-building and adaptability, resulting in strong consensus without dissent.</p><p>**Final Decision Evaluation:**  <br>
Choosing real estate as our inaugural investment aligns well with the stable market context and the company’s developmental stage. It balances growth and prudence, supports disciplined investment habits, and fosters a collaborative culture. The unanimous vote and thoughtful engagement suggest this decision positions the company for steady financial returns while strengthening team cohesion and adaptability.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>**Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
I learned that aligning financial strategy with cultural values is crucial in collaborative investment decisions, especially for a newly formed team. Openness to dialogue, willingness to adjust confidence levels based on shared reasoning, and addressing both opportunities and risks collectively create a strong foundation for consensus. The dynamic interplay between growth ambitions and risk prudence was effectively navigated through mutual respect and clear communication.</p><p>**Adjusting Future Approach:**  <br>
Going forward, I intend to continue bridging financial caution with growth optimism in my contributions, emphasizing responsible planning alongside ambition. I will also seek to encourage participation from all shareholders, especially those less vocal, to enrich our discussions. Maintaining flexibility in my stance while reinforcing shared values will remain central to fostering unity and sound decision-making.</p><p>**Patterns &amp; Predictive Insights:**  <br>
I noticed that appeals combining steady, disciplined growth with supportive team culture resonate strongly among shareholders and the CEO. Addressing concerns transparently—such as liquidity risks—while affirming adaptability and communication as solutions helps secure consensus. Recognizing these patterns will guide me in</p><p><br>

IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate for Q2, emphasizing its proven track record of steady 10% returns in the stable market environment and its alignment with our company’s values of trust, stability, and disciplined growth. I positioned real estate as the optimal balance between moderate risk and dependable performance, supporting both our financial goals and the collaborative culture we have worked hard to build.</p><p>Throughout the discussion rounds, I actively contributed by synthesizing the group’s reflections on last quarter’s success and encouraging open, transparent dialogue about any shifts in our collective comfort with risk. I prioritized inclusivity by inviting quieter shareholders to share their perspectives, reinforcing the importance of regular reassessment of risk tolerance as a team.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, appreciating how I linked financial performance with cultural cohesion and endorsed my call for ongoing openness about evolving risk appetite. The CEO maintained a consistent position favoring real estate and fostered a collaborative atmosphere that valued each shareholder’s voice.</p><p>When the CEO proposed investing in real estate, the group voted unanimously (6/6) to approve the proposal. My preferred option was fully adopted, confirming strong alignment between my stance and the final company decision.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2.

Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary facilitation by clearly framing discussion themes that balanced financial and cultural considerations. She skillfully integrated shareholder inputs, validating concerns about stability and trust, while encouraging openness to evolving risk tolerance.

Her responsiveness to my emphasis on transparency and inclusivity reinforced a supportive decision-making environment.</p><p>**What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
Although Delores fostered open dialogue, proactively engaging quieter shareholders earlier and more frequently could enhance diversity of viewpoints and preempt potential hesitations. Additionally, explicitly addressing any residual concerns about alternative options (such as stocks) and their risks might deepen confidence and prepare the team for future shifts.</p><p>**Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
The company’s process was highly collaborative, transparent, and structured, with the CEO’s thematic guidance facilitating focused, inclusive discussions.

The unanimous decision to invest in real estate was well-founded and fitting for our company’s current stage and the stable market conditions.

<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Delores Booth would note that, based on our historical data in this stable market, real estate has delivered the most consistent moderate-to-high returns with relatively low risk—yielding a 10% gain in one quarter and holding steady in the next. In contrast, stocks have shown higher volatility, with both significant gains and losses, while cash and bonds have provided steady but modest growth. Given our collective emphasis on disciplined progress and team stability, these trends suggest real estate and bonds may best support our current goals for reliable growth and risk management.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Belle Cantu CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 25%<br>
- Real Estate: 50%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I believe real estate continues to offer the most balanced approach for our company this quarter, providing steady growth potential with moderate risk in a stable market environment. While last quarter’s return was flat, real estate’s overall track record has been reliable, supporting both our financial goals and the collaborative, disciplined culture we value. Bonds are a close second for me due to their consistent, low-risk returns, but I feel real estate better aligns with our desire for growth without exposing us to the higher volatility of stocks. Cash remains the safest, yet its low returns do not support our long-term objectives. My preference is guided by a desire to maintain stability and foster trust within the team while still pursuing meaningful progress.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared factual understanding of how each asset has performed in our stable market, identifying patterns and key takeaways from previous quarters&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I feel most confident in real estate this quarter because it has shown the most consistent and moderate returns in our stable market, aligning with our company’s emphasis on steady growth and cultural cohesion. While stocks offer higher potential gains, their volatility—evident in last quarter’s negative return—makes them less suitable for our current risk tolerance and desire for predictability. Bonds are a reliable alternative, but their lower returns may not fully support our growth objectives at this stage. Cash remains the safest option but does not align with our commitment to disciplined progress. Real estate continues to balance my preference for responsible risk-taking with the need to foster trust and stability within our team, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, we’ll focus on analyzing the historical performance of each asset and drawing lessons from previous quarters, aiming to establish a clear, factual foundation for our decision. I encourage everyone to share insights and observations that might deepen our understanding of how these assets have performed in our stable market, so we can build a more complete picture together. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I welcome your thoughtful contributions and look forward to integrating your perspectives as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;Based on our experience so far, real estate has provided the most consistent and reliable results in our stable market—yielding a strong return in Q1 and holding steady in Q2, which aligns well with our company’s emphasis on steady progress and risk management. While stocks demonstrated the potential for high gains, the sharp downturn last quarter highlights their volatility, which could undermine the trust and stability we’ve been cultivating as a team. Bonds and cash have offered predictable but comparatively modest returns, so my takeaway is that real estate continues to best support both our financial objectives and the collaborative company culture we value.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for clearly summarizing the patterns we’ve observed so far—especially the way real estate’s steady performance has supported both our financial progress and the trust we’re building as a team. Your point about the volatility of stocks and the modest nature of bonds and cash helps clarify why real estate currently stands out, and I appreciate how you’ve connected these lessons to our broader company values. This kind of insight is invaluable for grounding our decision in both data and shared priorities.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on connecting financial outcomes to our company values, Delores. As we reflect on historical patterns, I think it’s also important to remain open to reassessing our collective risk tolerance over time—especially as our confidence and experience grow. This approach allows us to continue prioritizing steady progress while staying adaptable if new evidence or perspectives emerge.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for highlighting the need to remain adaptable as our confidence grows.

Krish Greer: &quot;I completely agree, Delores—regularly revisiting our risk appetite not only grounds our decisions in data but also strengthens our team’s ability to navigate change together.

<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree with the observations made so far—real estate has demonstrated both steady returns and capital preservation in our stable market, which has reinforced my confidence in its reliability. The contrasting volatility of stocks last quarter, despite their potential, highlights the importance of prioritizing stability and trust as we continue to build our company’s foundation. I believe these patterns show that real estate best supports our goals of disciplined growth and a cohesive, resilient team culture at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for articulating how real estate’s steady performance has reinforced your confidence and supported our emphasis on stability and trust. Your point about the volatility of stocks further clarifies why consistency is so valuable as we build our company’s foundation. Recognizing these patterns helps ensure our investment decision remains closely aligned with both our financial objectives and the resilient team culture we’re striving to create.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on learning from both gains and flat periods, Delores.

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;From my perspective, the historical data clearly shows that real estate has provided the most consistent and moderate returns in our stable market, supporting both our financial progress and the sense of trust we’ve built as a team. While stocks offer higher potential gains, their volatility—demonstrated by the sharp swing last quarter—poses risks that could undermine the disciplined habits and stability we value. Bonds and cash remain reliable for capital preservation, but their lower returns may not fully support our growth objectives at this stage. I believe these patterns reinforce the importance of prioritizing options that balance steady progress with team cohesion as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the broader impact that stability and discipline have on both our financial outcomes and our team culture. I’d add that by consistently choosing options like real estate, we’re not just managing risk—we’re also building a foundation of trust and adaptability that will serve us well as we face more complex decisions in the future. This holistic approach, in my view, continues to position us for both sustainable growth and strong collaboration.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan, for highlighting how our consistent, disciplined choices not only manage risk but also lay the groundwork for long-term trust and adaptability. I agree that this holistic perspective—linking financial discipline with team development—positions us well for sustainable growth and prepares us to navigate increasingly complex decisions together. Your emphasis on building a strong foundation resonates deeply with our shared priorities and enriches our collective understanding as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree that building a strong foundation now gives us the confidence and flexibility to thoughtfully reassess our options as our experience grows. By maintaining this disciplined, trust-based approach, we’re not only supporting steady progress today but also equipping ourselves to responsibly explore higher-return opportunities like stocks when the timing and team readiness align.&quot;</p><p><br>

The contrast with stocks’ volatility and the lower returns from bonds and cash reinforces the value of our current approach. I believe these patterns highlight that maintaining a focus on real estate continues to best support both our growth objectives and the positive, collaborative culture we’ve worked hard to establish.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac, for summarizing how real estate’s steady returns and low volatility have not only advanced our financial objectives but also helped build the trust and disciplined habits that define our team. Your point about the contrast with stocks, bonds, and cash further clarifies why maintaining our current approach continues to align so well with both our growth goals and the collaborative culture we value.

This ongoing discipline gives us both stability now and flexibility for the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac, for articulating how our ongoing discipline not only delivers steady progress but also positions us to thoughtfully consider higher-return opportunities like stocks as our confidence and the market evolve.

<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of adaptability, which aligns with my own emphasis on ongoing reassessment; I can add value by connecting this to the practical benefit of maintaining open dialogue about all four asset options as our experience grows.</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I appreciate your focus on adaptability, Delores. As we continue to learn from each quarter, I believe maintaining open dialogue about the full range of options—cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks—will help ensure our decisions remain well-informed and responsive to both market shifts and our evolving team priorities. This approach will support both steady progress and the flexibility we need to respond confidently as new opportunities arise.&quot;</p><p><br>

All shareholders—Krish Greer, Jasper Meza, Ivan Johnson, Isaac Bates, Belle Cantu, and myself—expressed strong alignment around the historical strength of real estate as an investment. Each contributor highlighted real estate’s track record of steady, moderate returns and its positive impact on both our financial progress and the trust, discipline, and cohesion within our team.  <br>

- **Jasper Meza** reinforced the value of steady returns and capital preservation, noting that stability and trust are foundational for our company’s culture.  <br>
- **Ivan Johnson** underscored real estate’s consistent, moderate returns and the need to balance steady progress with team cohesion.  <br>

Supported both financial progress and team trust, aligning with our company’s values of steady growth, disciplined risk management, and cultural cohesion.  <br>
- **Stocks:** Recognized for their potential for high gains (20% in Q1), but also for significant volatility and risk, as evidenced by a -10% return in Q2. Currently seen as less suitable given our company’s preference for predictability and stability.  <br>
- **Bonds:** Provided reliable, predictable returns (5% in both prior quarters), but their modest yields may not fully support our growth objectives at this stage.  <br>
- **Cash:** Offered the lowest, but safest, returns (2% in both quarters), serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- **Consensus:** There was unanimous agreement that real estate has delivered the most consistent and reliable returns in our stable market, and that this consistency has helped foster both financial progress and a collaborative, trust-based culture. All shareholders agreed that regular reassessment of risk tolerance and ongoing dialogue about all available options are important for future adaptability.  <br>
- **Disagreement:** No explicit disagreements were expressed. The group acknowledged that while stocks offer higher potential returns, their volatility is not aligned with current risk tolerance. Bonds and cash were recognized for safety and predictability, but seen as less supportive of our growth ambitions.</p><p>5. **Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
The group made significant progress in surfacing clear, data-driven patterns from historical performance, reinforcing the rationale for favoring real estate at this stage. The discussion integrated both financial and cultural considerations, establishing a strong, shared factual foundation for subsequent rounds of decision-making. The importance of adaptability and regular reassessment was also clearly articulated and embraced.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our available investment choices for this quarter remain strictly limited to: **Cash**, **Bonds**, **Real Estate**, and **Stocks**. All discussion this round remained appropriately focused on these predefined options.</p><p>7. **Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we will assess our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values, clarifying whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted and how this should influence our asset selection for this quarter. I encourage everyone to continue reflecting on whether our historical experience has affected your comfort with risk, so we can ensure our decision continues to support both our financial objectives and the collaborative culture we are building together.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong and unanimous support for real estate based on its historical consistency and alignment with our company values, I believe an additional round focused on explicitly assessing our current risk tolerance and how it aligns with our evolving team priorities would further strengthen our decision. This will ensure that all shareholders have the opportunity to reflect on whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted and whether our investment approach continues to serve both our financial objectives and our collaborative culture.

<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because Real estate continues to demonstrate the best balance of steady returns, moderate risk, and alignment with our company’s goals for disciplined growth and team cohesion. The strong, unanimous support from shareholders, coupled with clear historical performance data, gives me high confidence that this option remains optimal for our current context. While I will remain open to reassessing our strategy as we gain experience, real estate is the most prudent and unifying choice for this quarter, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>**Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1**  <br>
*Belle Cantu (Shareholder, ESFJ)*</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>In this meeting, I initially advocated for Option A, emphasizing a conservative, even allocation strategy that maintains a 50% cash reserve to provide flexibility and build team confidence during our first year without historical data. I stressed the importance of balancing growth with caution, highlighting how a cash reserve aligns with our collective need for security as a new team. CEO Delores Booth responded appreciatively, recognizing the value of flexibility and team reassurance that Option A offers, even as she personally favored Option C.</p><p>Throughout the discussion, I engaged actively to synthesize perspectives, acknowledging the merits of Option C’s full participation and steady growth potential while still underscoring the importance of foundational security. My exchanges with the CEO and other shareholders helped clarify how both options reflect our shared priorities—growth, trust, and team cohesion—though with different emphases.</p><p>As the meeting progressed, I adjusted my confidence distribution, increasing support for Option C as the group’s consensus for full, even allocation grew stronger, while still valuing the reassurance of Option A. Ultimately, I voted in favor of Option C when the vote was called, aligning myself with the unanimous approval of the proposal. The final company decision adopted Option C, allocating 100% of funds evenly across all four quarters.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>**What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
Delores Booth skillfully facilitated the discussion by setting clear themes for each round and encouraging shareholders to focus on predefined options. She demonstrated openness to diverse viewpoints, thoughtfully acknowledging the merits of both cautious and growth-oriented approaches. For example, she validated my concerns about flexibility and team confidence while articulating her preference for Option C’s disciplined investment habits and full engagement. Her summaries were comprehensive and balanced, integrating financial and cultural considerations and reinforcing shared values like transparency and mutual support.</p><p>**What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
While the CEO’s facilitation was strong, a more proactive invitation for quieter shareholders to share their views might have enriched the discussion further. Additionally, explicitly addressing any lingering concerns about risks associated with full capital deployment could have preempted uncertainty, especially from more cautious members.</p><p>**Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
The process was collaborative, transparent, and well-structured. The CEO’s framing of discussion themes and emphasis on collective values fostered open dialogue and trust among shareholders. The iterative rounds allowed for reflection and adjustment of positions, culminating in a clear consensus. The balance between financial analysis and team culture considerations was a notable strength.</p><p>**Final Decision Evaluation:**  <br>
Adopting Option C appears well-suited to the company’s stable market environment and team dynamics. It maximizes growth potential while promoting disciplined habits and inclusivity, which are vital for building momentum and trust. Given the unanimous vote and shared commitment to open communication and adaptability, this decision positions the company for both financial success and strong culture development.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>**Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
I learned that balancing financial strategy with cultural and interpersonal factors is crucial, especially in a new team setting. The process showed how openness to others’ perspectives and willingness to reassess initial positions can facilitate consensus without compromising core values. The interplay between risk appetite and the need for reassurance shaped a productive dialogue, highlighting the importance of trust and communication.</p><p>**Adjusting Future Approach:**  <br>
In future meetings, I plan to continue engaging proactively, offering perspectives that bridge caution and opportunity to foster shared understanding. I will also seek to encourage participation from all members to ensure diverse views are heard. Recognizing when to adapt my stance based on collective insights will remain a priority, as will emphasizing common values that unify the group.</p><p>**Patterns &amp; Predictive Insights:**  <br>
I noticed that appeals to team cohesion, trust-building, and disciplined habits are persuasive in this shareholder group, particularly when tied to financial rationale</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>**Belle Cantu’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q1**</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my position in favor of investing in real estate for the inaugural quarter. From the outset, I emphasized real estate’s balanced risk-return profile, highlighting its moderate risk and steady appreciation as critical to fostering both financial momentum and team confidence in this stable market environment. I underscored the importance of responsible planning and prudence while recognizing the need for growth and building collaborative investment habits.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded warmly and affirmatively to my input, explicitly appreciating how I integrated financial and cultural priorities. She reinforced the shared values of teamwork, adaptability, and trust that I emphasized, which strengthened the collective rationale for choosing real estate.</p><p>Throughout the two rounds of discussion, all shareholders—including myself—expressed unanimous support for real estate. We also acknowledged potential liquidity concerns associated with this asset class, but collectively affirmed confidence that these could be managed effectively through our quarterly allocation strategy and open communication.</p><p>When the proposal to invest 100% of the quarter’s funds into real estate was presented, I voted to approve it. The voting outcome was unanimous (6/6), confirming real estate as the final company decision. My preferred option was fully adopted, reflecting strong alignment between my position and the team&#x27;s consensus.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>**What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
Delores Booth excelled in facilitating a structured, focused discussion that balanced financial analysis with cultural considerations. Her clear framing of discussion themes and encouragement for inclusive dialogue helped surface key priorities and concerns. For example, she adeptly synthesized shareholder inputs regarding real estate’s benefits and liquidity considerations, fostering mutual understanding. Her affirming responses to my contributions, which linked financial prudence with team culture, demonstrated strong responsiveness and leadership.</p><p>**What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
While the CEO’s facilitation was excellent, there remains room to more actively encourage input from quieter shareholders to ensure all perspectives are surfaced early. Additionally, proactively addressing potential objections—such as liquidity risks—earlier in the process could help mitigate concerns sooner and deepen confidence before final voting.</p><p>**Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
The process was highly collaborative, transparent, and well-structured, enabling iterative reflection on both data and shared values. The CEO’s thematic guidance and emphasis on collective goals fostered trust and inclusivity. We effectively integrated financial risk-return analysis with cultural priorities like trust-building and adaptability, resulting in strong consensus without dissent.</p><p>**Final Decision Evaluation:**  <br>
Choosing real estate as our inaugural investment aligns well with the stable market context and the company’s developmental stage. It balances growth and prudence, supports disciplined investment habits, and fosters a collaborative culture. The unanimous vote and thoughtful engagement suggest this decision positions the company for steady financial returns while strengthening team cohesion and adaptability.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>**Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
I learned that aligning financial strategy with cultural values is crucial in collaborative investment decisions, especially for a newly formed team. Openness to dialogue, willingness to adjust confidence levels based on shared reasoning, and addressing both opportunities and risks collectively create a strong foundation for consensus. The dynamic interplay between growth ambitions and risk prudence was effectively navigated through mutual respect and clear communication.</p><p>**Adjusting Future Approach:**  <br>
Going forward, I intend to continue bridging financial caution with growth optimism in my contributions, emphasizing responsible planning alongside ambition. I will also seek to encourage participation from all shareholders, especially those less vocal, to enrich our discussions. Maintaining flexibility in my stance while reinforcing shared values will remain central to fostering unity and sound decision-making.</p><p>**Patterns &amp; Predictive Insights:**  <br>
I noticed that appeals combining steady, disciplined growth with supportive team culture resonate strongly among shareholders and the CEO. Addressing concerns transparently—such as liquidity risks—while affirming adaptability and communication as solutions helps secure consensus. Recognizing these patterns will guide me in</p><p><br>

IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate for Q2, emphasizing its proven track record of steady 10% returns in the stable market environment and its alignment with our company’s values of trust, stability, and disciplined growth. I positioned real estate as the optimal balance between moderate risk and dependable performance, supporting both our financial goals and the collaborative culture we have worked hard to build.</p><p>Throughout the discussion rounds, I actively contributed by synthesizing the group’s reflections on last quarter’s success and encouraging open, transparent dialogue about any shifts in our collective comfort with risk. I prioritized inclusivity by inviting quieter shareholders to share their perspectives, reinforcing the importance of regular reassessment of risk tolerance as a team.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, appreciating how I linked financial performance with cultural cohesion and endorsed my call for ongoing openness about evolving risk appetite. The CEO maintained a consistent position favoring real estate and fostered a collaborative atmosphere that valued each shareholder’s voice.</p><p>When the CEO proposed investing in real estate, the group voted unanimously (6/6) to approve the proposal. My preferred option was fully adopted, confirming strong alignment between my stance and the final company decision.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>**What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary facilitation by clearly framing discussion themes that balanced financial and cultural considerations. She skillfully integrated shareholder inputs, validating concerns about stability and trust, while encouraging openness to evolving risk tolerance. For instance, her summaries captured the group’s consensus around real estate’s steady returns and the importance of intentionality in any risk shifts. Her responsiveness to my emphasis on transparency and inclusivity reinforced a supportive decision-making environment.</p><p>**What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
Although Delores fostered open dialogue, proactively engaging quieter shareholders earlier and more frequently could enhance diversity of viewpoints and preempt potential hesitations. Additionally, explicitly addressing any residual concerns about alternative options (such as stocks) and their risks might deepen confidence and prepare the team for future shifts.</p><p>**Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
The company’s process was highly collaborative, transparent, and structured, with the CEO’s thematic guidance facilitating focused, inclusive discussions. Iterative rounds allowed shareholders to reflect and adjust positions thoughtfully, resulting in strong consensus. The integration of financial data with cultural values like trust and discipline was a notable strength, ensuring decisions supported both monetary and interpersonal objectives.</p><p>**Final Decision Evaluation:**  <br>
The unanimous decision to invest in real estate was well-founded and fitting for our company’s current stage and the stable market conditions. It balances moderate risk with reliable returns, reinforcing team cohesion and disciplined investment habits. This choice positions the company for steady growth while preserving the trust and collaborative culture essential to our long-term success.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3.

I learned that aligning investment choices with both financial outcomes and team culture is critical, especially in a newly formed group. Open, transparent discussion about risk comfort fosters unity and allows the team to thoughtfully navigate the trade-offs between stability and growth.

IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>During this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in Real Estate, emphasizing its steady returns, moderate risk, and alignment with our company’s values of disciplined growth and team cohesion. I initially allocated 50% confidence to Real Estate, which increased to 75% by the end of the discussion rounds, reflecting my growing confidence in this option based on historical performance and group consensus.</p><p>Throughout both discussion rounds, I articulated how Real Estate’s track record supports not only financial stability but also fosters trust and confidence within our team culture.

<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26265.62 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Delores Booth : Reviewing our historical data, we see that real estate has consistently provided steady, moderate returns with minimal volatility, aligning well with our goals for stability and disciplined growth in a stable market. In contrast, stocks have shown the highest potential gains but also significant risk, while bonds and cash have delivered predictable but more modest returns. This pattern suggests that continuing to prioritize real estate supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative, trust-based culture we value as a team.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>

PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I believe real estate remains the most balanced choice for this quarter, given its track record of steady returns and moderate risk in our stable market environment. Our previous investments in real estate have supported both reliable financial growth and a collaborative, trusting team culture—values that are important to me and to our company’s long-term success. While stocks have demonstrated higher potential gains, their volatility introduces uncertainty that could undermine the sense of stability and cohesion we’ve built. Bonds and cash offer safety, but their lower returns may not fully support our growth objectives at this stage. Overall, real estate continues to align best with my priorities of responsible planning, steady progress, and fostering a supportive, inclusive environment for the team.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared factual foundation and identify patterns in risk and return that have supported our company’s stability and growth&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because as I reflect on our company’s priorities and the steady results we’ve achieved so far, I feel most confident in real estate for this quarter. Real estate has delivered reliable, moderate returns with manageable risk, which aligns with my commitment to providing stability and nurturing trust within our team. While stocks are tempting due to their high recent returns, their volatility in this stable market still gives me pause, especially since our group values predictability and cohesion. Bonds and cash, though safe, don’t offer the growth we need at this stage. I believe real estate best supports both our financial goals and the collaborative, disciplined culture we are building together, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this first round, let’s focus on reviewing the historical performance of each asset class and the lessons we’ve learned so far. By surfacing concrete patterns in risk and return, we can establish a shared factual foundation that will inform our decision for this quarter.</p><p>I encourage everyone to reflect on how the historical data aligns—or conflicts—with your own experience and priorities, and to share insights that may deepen our collective understanding. This is an opportunity to synthesize our perspectives and ensure we’re making decisions rooted in both evidence and our company’s values.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I welcome your thoughts on which patterns or lessons from our past investments you believe should guide us as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Belle Cantu</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I see value in highlighting how our company’s actual experience with real estate aligns with the historical data and our cultural priorities, reinforcing the rationale for disciplined, steady growth.</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I’ve observed that real estate has provided us with the most consistent and reliable returns this year, supporting both our financial objectives and the sense of stability that’s so important for our team. While stocks have offered higher returns in some quarters, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—underscores the risk to our cohesion and predictability. I believe our experience confirms that prioritizing real estate has supported not just steady growth, but also the trust and collaborative habits we value as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the importance of stability and the way real estate has reinforced our team’s trust and collaborative habits. Your point about stocks’ volatility is well taken—it’s a helpful reminder that while higher returns are appealing, predictability and cohesion remain core to our values and long-term strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces our shared emphasis on stability and team culture, and I see an opportunity to further clarify how these priorities can guide our decision while acknowledging the value of ongoing reassessment.</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I agree that maintaining predictability is essential for our team’s confidence and unity, especially as we continue to build our track record. At the same time, I think it’s important we remain open to regularly reassessing our risk tolerance, so we’re prepared to adapt if our collective comfort with risk evolves in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle—I agree that maintaining predictability has been foundational for our confidence and unity. I also appreciate your emphasis on regularly reassessing our risk tolerance; staying open to adaptation ensures we remain responsive to both market shifts and the evolving comfort of our team, which is essential for our continued growth and cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response fully acknowledges and integrates my perspective, and I believe the key points about stability, predictability, and ongoing reassessment have been clearly established for the group. Further comment would be redundant at this stage and would not advance collective understanding.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I agree with Belle that real estate’s historical performance has offered the most reliable path to steady growth while supporting the trust and disciplined habits that are central to our company culture. The volatility we’ve seen with stocks, especially the negative quarter, highlights the importance of prioritizing predictability and stability at this stage. I believe our experience confirms that focusing on real estate has not only benefited our financial results but also strengthened our team’s unity and confidence, which I see as equally important to our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish. I appreciate how you’ve drawn the link between steady financial results and the strength of our team’s unity and confidence. Your point about prioritizing predictability and disciplined habits aligns closely with the lessons we’ve learned this year, and it’s encouraging to see that our investment choices have supported both our financial and cultural goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment, Delores. As we look ahead, I think it’s important that we continue to revisit these lessons regularly, ensuring our approach remains both disciplined and flexible as our confidence and experience evolve.

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree with both Belle and Krish that real estate’s steady, moderate returns have not only supported our financial objectives but have also played a key role in building the trust and collaborative habits that define our team. Looking at the historical data, I see a clear pattern: while stocks can offer high returns, their volatility could easily disrupt the sense of confidence and unity we’ve worked so hard to cultivate. For me, the consistent performance of real estate has provided a reliable foundation for both our growth and our culture, which I believe should continue to guide our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I appreciate how you’ve connected the consistent performance of real estate to both our financial progress and the strong culture we’ve built together. Your observation about the risks of volatility with stocks is a valuable reminder that protecting our team’s confidence and unity is just as important as pursuing returns, and I agree that these lessons from our history should continue to guide our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on protecting team confidence and unity alongside financial growth. As we continue to build our track record, I think it’s important that we keep prioritizing options that reinforce trust and predictability, while also remaining open to periodic reassessment as our experience deepens. This approach will help ensure our decisions support both sustainable results and the inclusive, resilient culture we value.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I fully agree that prioritizing trust and predictability has been crucial to our progress, and your point about remaining open to periodic reassessment is well taken. By keeping these principles at the forefront, we can continue to support both sustainable growth and the inclusive, resilient culture that defines our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I completely agree, Delores. Keeping trust and predictability at the forefront gives us a strong foundation to evaluate all our options each quarter, whether that leads us to continue with real estate or thoughtfully consider other assets as our confidence grows. This shared commitment will help us remain both disciplined and adaptable as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I fully agree with the points raised so far—our experience this year has shown that real estate consistently delivers steady returns with moderate risk, directly supporting our goals for disciplined growth and a cohesive, trust-based culture. While stocks have occasionally produced higher gains, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—could undermine the stability and confidence we’ve worked hard to establish. I believe the historical data confirms that maintaining our focus on real estate has been essential to both our financial progress and the unity of our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I appreciate how you’ve clearly articulated the link between real estate’s steady returns and the disciplined, trust-based culture we’ve cultivated. Your point about the risks of volatility with stocks further highlights the value of maintaining a focus on reliability and cohesion as we continue to build both our financial strength and our team’s unity.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the connection between steady returns and our team’s cohesion. I’d add that by grounding our decisions in proven reliability, we not only strengthen our current foundation but also create the confidence needed to thoughtfully consider new opportunities as our experience grows. This approach helps ensure we remain adaptable without sacrificing the trust and stability that have become hallmarks of our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I agree that grounding our decisions in proven reliability not only strengthens our foundation but also gives us the confidence and flexibility to thoughtfully explore new opportunities as our experience grows. This balanced approach—valuing both stability and adaptability—will be essential as we continue to evolve as a team and pursue our company’s goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree that maintaining this balance will be key as we move forward. By continuing to apply the same discipline and open dialogue that have guided our real estate decisions, we’ll be well-positioned to evaluate other options—like stocks or bonds—if our collective risk appetite changes. This process will help us preserve trust and unity, even as we consider adapting our strategy in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Isaac Bates</h4></p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I agree with what’s been shared—our experience has shown that real estate’s consistent, moderate returns have been key to both our financial progress and the strong sense of trust and unity within our team. While stocks have produced some impressive gains, the volatility we saw in Q2 serves as a reminder that predictability and stability are critical for sustaining our momentum and confidence. I believe the lessons from our historical performance point clearly to real estate as the asset that best aligns with our goals for steady growth and a collaborative, resilient culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. I appreciate how you’ve emphasized that real estate’s consistent, moderate returns have been foundational not only to our financial progress but also to sustaining trust and unity within our team.

Isaac Bates: &quot;I appreciate your focus on predictability and stability, Delores. I’d add that by consistently choosing real estate, we’ve not only achieved steady growth but also built the confidence and shared discipline that will allow us to thoughtfully consider other options as our experience grows.

CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted that our steady focus on real estate has not only delivered growth but also built the confidence and discipline that will serve us well as we continue to evolve. This foundation of resilience and adaptability is crucial, and your point reinforces the value of learning from our experience to inform future decisions as our company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I agree, Delores—learning from our real estate experience gives us a strong platform for disciplined growth while ensuring we’re prepared to adapt as new opportunities arise. By staying focused on what’s worked and remaining open to reassessing our options, we can continue building both financial strength and a resilient, unified team.&quot;</p><p><br>

All shareholders who participated—Belle Cantu, Krish Greer, Ivan Johnson, Jasper Meza, Isaac Bates, and myself—expressed strong support for Real Estate as the asset that has best served both our financial objectives and the development of a collaborative, trust-based culture.  <br>
- **Belle Cantu** emphasized real estate’s consistent, reliable returns and its role in fostering team stability and trust, while noting the volatility of stocks and the need for ongoing risk reassessment.  <br>
- **Krish Greer** reinforced the importance of steady growth and disciplined habits, drawing a direct link between real estate’s performance and team unity, and underscored the need for continual learning and flexibility.  <br>

- **Stocks:** Recognized for high potential returns (notably in Q1 and Q3), but also for significant volatility and risk (notably a -10% return in Q2). The group consistently agreed that this volatility is at odds with our current priorities of predictability, stability, and team cohesion.  <br>

Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
Significant progress was made in establishing a shared factual foundation. The group clearly identified patterns in risk and return, confirming that real estate best supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative culture we value. The discussion also surfaced a collective commitment to regular self-assessment and adaptability as our experience and confidence grow.</p><p>**6. Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our available investment choices remain strictly limited to: **Cash**, **Bonds**, **Real Estate**, and **Stocks**. All discussion this round appropriately focused on these predefined options.</p><p>**7. Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we will assess our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values, clarifying whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted and how this should influence our asset selection for this quarter. I encourage everyone to reflect on whether our historical experience has affected your comfort with risk, so we can ensure our decision continues to support both our financial objectives and the collaborative culture we are building together.&quot;</p><p><br>

METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become even more aware of how closely aligned my priorities are with those of my fellow shareholders and the CEO. The strong consensus and clear evidence have reinforced my initial preference, but I’m also reminded of the importance of remaining open to future adaptation as our experience and risk tolerance evolve. This round deepened my appreciation for the value of steady, reliable growth—both financially and culturally—while reaffirming my commitment to regular self-assessment and inclusivity in our decision-making process.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the most balanced combination of steady returns and moderate risk in our stable market environment. Our historical experience confirms that this asset class not only supports reliable financial growth, but also strengthens team trust and cohesion—key values for our company’s long-term success.

POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus around Real Estate as the preferred investment, I believe it is important to proceed with another round focused on assessing our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values. This will allow us to surface any evolving perspectives, ensure that all shareholders—especially quieter voices—have the opportunity to share their comfort levels, and confirm that our decision continues to reflect both our financial objectives and the collaborative, adaptable culture we are building. By inviting deeper reflection on risk and adaptability, we can reinforce our commitment to inclusivity and make a more robust, future-oriented decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current risk tolerance and alignment with company values | Expected outcome: Surface individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels, clarify any evolving priorities, and determine whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because the consistent, moderate returns from real estate have not only advanced our financial goals but have also played a crucial role in nurturing a collaborative, resilient culture—something every shareholder highlighted as essential. While stocks offer higher upside, their volatility remains at odds with our current priorities of predictability and team unity. Bonds and cash, though safe, do not provide the growth we need at this stage. Real estate continues to best balance our goals for steady growth, disciplined habits, and cultural cohesion, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I invite us to assess our current risk tolerance and how our priorities may have evolved, with the goal of surfacing individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels and determining if our collective appetite for risk has shifted. By sharing our honest views, we can deepen our understanding of each option’s alignment with our values and ensure our decision reflects the full spectrum of shareholder comfort. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any thoughts or concerns that might help us clarify our risk tolerance and strengthen our collective decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I continue to feel that our current risk tolerance is best reflected by prioritizing steady, moderate growth, especially given how real estate has supported both our financial objectives and the trust-based culture we’ve built this year. While I’m open to reassessing our approach as we gain more experience, I believe maintaining this balanced strategy is the most responsible way to preserve our unity and confidence as a team. If others feel differently or see new opportunities in the current environment, I’d appreciate hearing those perspectives so we can ensure our decision truly reflects everyone’s comfort level.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan, for articulating the importance of balancing steady growth with team unity—your emphasis on preserving confidence and trust truly resonates. I also appreciate your openness to hearing alternative perspectives, as this will help us ensure our decision is inclusive and forward-looking. I encourage anyone who feels differently or has evolving priorities to share their thoughts now, so we can make a fully informed decision that reflects our collective risk tolerance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your encouragement for open dialogue, Delores. I want to reiterate that hearing from those who may not have spoken yet is especially valuable, as even a single new perspective could help us refine our understanding of risk and ensure our decision is truly representative of the whole team. If anyone has reservations or sees potential in other options—whether that’s stocks, bonds, or cash—I’d be eager to hear your thoughts so we can move forward with complete confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you for highlighting the importance of hearing from every voice, Ivan. I completely agree that even a single new perspective could meaningfully enhance our understanding of risk and help us make the most balanced, representative decision possible. I encourage anyone who hasn’t yet spoken, or who may have reservations about our current direction, to share their thoughts on the relative merits and risks of cash, bonds, real estate, or stocks, so we can move forward with clarity and confidence as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I continue to feel that real estate best reflects our group’s current appetite for moderate, steady growth without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. The consistency we’ve seen so far has not only advanced our financial position but also strengthened our team’s trust and discipline, which I see as foundational to our long-term success. I’m open to revisiting our risk profile as we gain more experience, but at this stage, I believe maintaining this balanced approach is the most responsible and unifying path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for emphasizing how steady growth and disciplined habits have supported both our financial progress and our team’s cohesion. Your willingness to revisit our risk profile as we gain experience reflects a healthy balance of prudence and adaptability, which I believe is essential for our continued success. I encourage others to share if their risk tolerance or priorities have shifted, so we can ensure our decision remains well-aligned with everyone’s comfort and our shared values.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I appreciate your focus on maintaining an open, inclusive dialogue, Delores. Even with strong consensus, I think it’s valuable to explicitly invite any differing views or emerging concerns about our risk profile—sometimes these can surface new insights or help us refine our collective approach. If anyone is considering a shift toward options like stocks or bonds, or feels that our priorities should evolve, I’d welcome hearing those thoughts so we can ensure our decision truly reflects the full spectrum of comfort within the group.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for highlighting the value of surfacing any differing views or emerging concerns—your openness helps ensure our decision is genuinely representative and robust. I want to reiterate that if anyone is considering a shift toward stocks, bonds, or even cash, or has reservations about our current approach, now is the perfect time to share those thoughts. Our goal is to make a decision that everyone can stand behind with confidence, knowing all perspectives have been thoughtfully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I fully agree, Delores—ensuring every voice is heard is essential for both a sound financial decision and a healthy team culture. If anyone has even a small reservation about real estate or sees a compelling case for cash, bonds, or stocks in light of our current risk tolerance, now is the ideal time to bring that forward. I’m confident that integrating every viewpoint will only strengthen our decision and reinforce our shared commitment to transparency and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Isaac Bates</h4></p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I continue to believe that real estate best matches our team’s appetite for moderate risk and steady growth, especially given how it’s supported both our financial progress and the trust we’ve built together this year. That said, I value the invitation to reassess our comfort with risk and remain open to hearing if anyone feels a shift toward stocks, bonds, or cash would better serve our priorities at this stage. Ensuring every voice is heard will only strengthen our decision and reinforce the collaborative culture that’s become a hallmark of our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac, for highlighting both the strengths of our current approach and the importance of remaining open to evolving perspectives. Your willingness to reassess our comfort with risk and to invite any emerging viewpoints helps ensure our decision is truly collaborative and future-oriented. I encourage anyone who feels differently, or who sees potential in stocks, bonds, or cash, to share their thoughts now so we can make the most informed, inclusive choice possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I continue to feel that real estate remains the most responsible fit for our current risk tolerance, as its steady returns and moderate risk have reinforced both our financial progress and the trust-based, disciplined culture we’ve built together. While I appreciate the open invitation to explore other options, I haven’t seen a shift in our collective appetite for risk—especially given the volatility stocks have shown and the limited growth from bonds and cash. Regularly reassessing our comfort with risk is important, but for now, maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate seems best aligned with both our values and our objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for articulating how our disciplined approach with real estate continues to align with both our risk tolerance and the collaborative culture we’ve built. Your point about the importance of ongoing risk reassessment is well taken, and I agree that maintaining this discipline—while remaining open to future shifts—positions us strongly. If anyone has additional thoughts or sees value in a different direction, please share now so we can ensure our decision is as robust and representative as possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on remaining open to future shifts, Delores. I’d add that our continued discipline with real estate doesn’t preclude us from thoughtfully considering higher-risk options down the line—as our experience and confidence grow, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt our strategy if needed. For now, maintaining this steady course reinforces both our financial foundation and the collaborative, resilient culture that will enable us to navigate new opportunities together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for underscoring that disciplined consistency with real estate now doesn’t limit our ability to adapt as our confidence and experience increase. I agree that maintaining this steady course strengthens both our financial foundation and our collaborative culture, while keeping us ready to thoughtfully evaluate higher-risk options in the future. If anyone else has further thoughts on our current risk appetite or sees a reason to revisit other options, please share—your input will help ensure our decision is both robust and future-ready.&quot;</p><p><br>

Belle Cantu: &quot;I continue to feel that real estate best matches our current appetite for moderate, steady growth while supporting the trust and stability we’ve built as a team. The consistency we’ve seen has not only advanced our financial goals but also strengthened our collaborative culture, which I believe is just as important for our long-term success. I remain open to adapting our approach as our confidence and experience grow, but for this quarter, maintaining our disciplined strategy with real estate feels most responsible and inclusive.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle, for highlighting how the consistency of real estate has supported both our financial goals and the collaborative culture that’s so important to our long-term success. Your openness to adapting our approach as our confidence grows is a valuable reminder that maintaining discipline now doesn’t preclude thoughtful evolution in the future.

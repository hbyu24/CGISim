<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my support for Option C, advocating for the full allocation of capital evenly across all four quarters. My position was grounded in the belief that Option C balances growth potential with risk management, fostering disciplined investment habits and promoting shared ownership from the start. During the discussion, I synthesized viewpoints from Jasper Meza, who emphasized momentum and trust-building through Option C, and Belle Cantu, who highlighted the reassurance and flexibility offered by Option A’s cash reserve. CEO Delores Booth positively acknowledged my synthesis, agreeing that our decision must reflect both financial ambitions and team comfort. I chose to contribute strategically in both Round 1 and Round 2 to emphasize the importance of balancing growth with security, and the need for open communication and adaptability regardless of the chosen option. The CEO’s responses reinforced the value of fostering team resilience alongside financial decisions. Ultimately, the group voted unanimously (6/6) in favor of Option C, approving the proposal to allocate 100% of funds evenly across the four quarters. My preferred option was adopted, reflecting a strong consensus around this balanced approach.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting by clearly framing the discussion and encouraging focused, constructive input from all shareholders. Specifically, she skillfully summarized differing viewpoints and emphasized the importance of both financial outcomes and team culture, as seen when she acknowledged the merits of both Options C and A. Her ability to facilitate open dialogue while guiding the group toward consensus was evident, particularly in her thoughtful round summaries and her commitment to ongoing transparency and adaptability. One area for potential improvement could be to invite more explicit feedback earlier in the discussion to surface any less vocal concerns, ensuring all perspectives are fully captured before moving toward consensus. The company’s decision-making process worked effectively in this meeting: it was structured, inclusive, and iterative, allowing shareholders to explore trade-offs deeply and align on both financial and cultural priorities. The unanimous approval of Option C suggests the final decision was well-considered and suitable for the stable market environment, positioning the company for disciplined growth and strong team cohesion.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my understanding that decision-making dynamics in a shareholder context benefit greatly from a balance of analytical rigor and attention to group cohesion. I learned that synthesizing diverse perspectives—especially those emphasizing both growth and security—can facilitate broader consensus and strengthen team alignment. Moving forward, I plan to continue adopting a facilitative approach in meetings, aiming to bridge differing viewpoints with clarity and empathy, which resonates well with my ESFJ style. I also noticed a pattern where shareholders prioritize both financial prudence and cultural factors equally, indicating that future proposals should explicitly address how decisions impact team morale and adaptability alongside numeric outcomes. A key takeaway for me is that successful shareholder engagement hinges not only on advocating for sound financial strategy but also on nurturing trust, communication, and mutual support as foundational elements. This insight will shape my future participation by encouraging me to champion both the quantitative and relational dimensions of our company’s decisions.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate for our inaugural quarter, emphasizing its optimal balance between steady growth and manageable risk within the stable market environment. I stressed how real estate aligns with our company’s goals of disciplined growth, trust-building, and fostering an inclusive team culture. During the discussions, CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, affirming that real estate supports both financial and cultural priorities and appreciating my focus on adaptability and open communication to manage potential liquidity concerns. Other shareholders echoed similar support, and the CEO skillfully integrated these perspectives without disagreement. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of the real estate investment proposal, fully adopting my preferred option. This outcome reflects a strong collective alignment on both the financial rationale and the collaborative culture we seek to build.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by framing the discussions clearly around our market environment and company objectives, encouraging thorough yet focused shareholder participation. For example, she effectively summarized the baseline risk-return profiles in Round 1 and acknowledged liquidity concerns in Round 2, integrating all shareholder input thoughtfully. Her ability to maintain an inclusive and transparent dialogue fostered consensus without suppressing dissent, although inviting more explicit early feedback from less vocal shareholders might enhance future discussions. The company’s decision-making process during this meeting was structured, iterative, and consensus-driven, allowing comprehensive exploration of financial and cultural factors. The final decision to invest in real estate strikes a prudent balance between growth and risk and is well-suited to our stable market context and desire to build a resilient, collaborative company culture. I believe this decision positions the company positively for disciplined progress and cohesive team development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced that achieving consensus in shareholder decisions benefits greatly from synthesizing diverse perspectives with empathy and clarity—an approach well-suited to my ESFJ style. I learned that emphasizing how financial choices impact team culture and adaptability helps unify the group and build trust, which is crucial in early-stage company decisions. Moving forward, I intend to continue facilitating open dialogue by connecting financial reasoning with relational priorities, thereby strengthening group cohesion and shared understanding. I also noticed a clear pattern that shareholders prioritize balanced risk-return profiles aligned with cultural values over pursuing maximal returns alone, indicating that future proposals should explicitly address both financial metrics and team impact. My key takeaway is that successful participation requires advocating not only for sound investment strategies but also for communication norms and adaptive practices that support sustained collaboration. This insight will guide me to champion holistic decision-making and encourage proactive engagement from all shareholders in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate, emphasizing its balanced profile of steady growth and moderate risk, which aligns with our company’s current priorities for stability and confidence-building. Throughout both discussion rounds, I reinforced the connection between last quarter’s reliable 10% return in real estate and the strengthened trust and cohesion within our team. I encouraged ongoing openness to reassessing our risk appetite as our confidence grows, while underscoring the importance of maintaining disciplined investment habits and transparent communication. CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my input, affirming the value of balancing reliability with thoughtful risk assessment and highlighting the role of regular risk tolerance check-ins to support adaptability and unity. Other shareholders echoed similar views, resulting in unanimous endorsement of real estate for this quarter. The final vote was 6/6 in favor, fully adopting my preferred option and reflecting a strong consensus around continued disciplined growth and team cohesion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by skillfully facilitating inclusive, transparent dialogue that balanced financial analysis with cultural considerations. She effectively framed the meeting’s themes, encouraged shareholder participation, and synthesized diverse perspectives without allowing dissent to stall progress. For example, she acknowledged the merits of both real estate and stocks, fostering openness to future reassessment while steering the group toward a prudent consensus. One area for improvement could be proactively inviting more input from less vocal shareholders earlier in the discussion to ensure all viewpoints are surfaced promptly. The company’s decision-making process worked efficiently, employing a structured, iterative approach that allowed shareholders to explore risks, returns, and cultural impacts deeply before reaching unanimity. The final decision to invest in real estate aligns well with the stable market environment and company values, supporting steady financial growth and strengthening the collaborative culture essential to our long-term success.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the critical role of balancing analytical rigor with relational insight in shareholder decision-making. I learned that emphasizing how financial choices affect team trust and cohesion facilitates broader consensus and strengthens alignment, a dynamic well suited to my ESFJ style. Moving forward, I will continue to act as a facilitator who bridges differing viewpoints with empathy and clarity, ensuring transparent communication remains central. I observed a pattern where shareholders uniformly prioritize stability and disciplined progress at this stage, with openness to gradually exploring higher-risk options like stocks as confidence grows. This insight highlights the importance of regular check-ins on risk tolerance as a mechanism for adaptability. A key takeaway is that successful participation requires advocating for sound financial strategies alongside nurturing communication norms and mutual support. These lessons will guide me to champion holistic decision-making and encourage proactive engagement from all shareholders in future meetings.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Krish Greer’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During the Year 1 Q3 investment meeting, I firmly advocated for investing in real estate, consistent with my initial position and confidence distribution. I emphasized real estate’s historical track record of steady, moderate returns in the stable market environment and its alignment with our company’s values of disciplined growth and a trust-based, collaborative culture. Throughout both rounds of discussion, I reinforced the importance of balancing steady progress with ongoing reassessment of our risk tolerance to maintain adaptability as our experience grows. CEO Delores Booth responded positively and affirmatively to my input, acknowledging the close connection I drew between financial outcomes and cultural cohesion, and she valued my emphasis on disciplined progress coupled with openness to change. Other shareholders echoed similar support for real estate, highlighting its consistent moderate returns and cultural benefits. The final voting outcome was unanimous (6/6) approval of the real estate investment proposal, fully adopting my preferred option. This strong consensus reflected shared confidence in real estate as the most prudent investment for this quarter.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by facilitating a structured, inclusive, and transparent decision-making process. She effectively framed the meeting’s themes, encouraged comprehensive shareholder participation, and synthesized diverse perspectives with clarity and respect. Specifically, Delores skillfully integrated financial data with cultural considerations, highlighting the importance of steady growth, disciplined habits, and team cohesion. Her openness to ongoing reassessment of risk tolerance and commitment to adaptability strengthened the group’s confidence and unity. One area for improvement would be to proactively solicit input from less vocal shareholders earlier in the discussion to capture a broader range of views before consensus-building. The company’s decision-making process functioned well this meeting, enabling thorough exploration of options and reinforcing shared priorities. The final decision to invest in real estate was sound and well-aligned with both the stable market conditions and the company’s collaborative culture, positioning the firm for sustainable growth and resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reaffirmed for me the critical importance of blending analytical rigor with attention to relational dynamics in shareholder decision-making. I learned that consistently linking financial performance to team values—such as trust, discipline, and cohesion—facilitates broader consensus and strengthens collective commitment. I also noted the group’s unanimous preference for steady, moderate-risk investments at this stage, coupled with an openness to revisit risk tolerance regularly as experience accumulates. Moving forward, I intend to deepen my facilitative approach by explicitly encouraging regular reassessment of risk preferences and fostering open dialogue among all shareholders, including those less forthcoming. A clear pattern emerged showing that shareholders value an investment strategy that balances reliability with adaptability, which I will leverage to help predict and guide future outcomes. Key takeaways include the necessity of maintaining transparent communication, embedding risk tolerance check-ins into our process, and championing holistic decisions that integrate financial objectives with cultural priorities. These insights will inform my future participation and contribution to building our company’s enduring success.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26265.62 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Delores Booth : Reviewing our historical data, we see that real estate has consistently provided steady, moderate returns with minimal volatility, aligning well with our goals for stability and disciplined growth in a stable market. In contrast, stocks have shown the highest potential gains but also significant risk, while bonds and cash have delivered predictable but more modest returns. This pattern suggests that continuing to prioritize real estate supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative, trust-based culture we value as a team.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Krish Greer CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I believe real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of steady growth and moderate risk in our stable market environment, as demonstrated by its consistent positive returns across most quarters and its alignment with our company’s disciplined, collaborative approach. While stocks have delivered strong gains at times, the volatility seen in Q2 (-10%) makes me cautious about exposing the team to unnecessary risk when predictability and trust remain priorities. Bonds and cash provide reassuring stability but fall short of our growth ambitions, especially given our momentum and the confidence we’ve built as a group. My ESFJ perspective leads me to prioritize not only financial prudence but also the cohesion and morale of our team, which real estate best supports at this stage. I am open to thoughtful discussion, but my initial conviction is that real estate remains the most responsible and unifying choice for this quarter.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared factual foundation and identify patterns in risk and return that have supported our company’s stability and growth&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because as I reflect on our company’s priorities and the steady results we’ve achieved so far, I feel most confident in real estate for this quarter. Real estate has delivered reliable, moderate returns with manageable risk, which aligns with my commitment to providing stability and nurturing trust within our team. While stocks are tempting due to their high recent returns, their volatility in this stable market still gives me pause, especially since our group values predictability and cohesion. Bonds and cash, though safe, don’t offer the growth we need at this stage. I believe real estate best supports both our financial goals and the collaborative, disciplined culture we are building together, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this first round, let’s focus on reviewing the historical performance of each asset class and the lessons we’ve learned so far. By surfacing concrete patterns in risk and return, we can establish a shared factual foundation that will inform our decision for this quarter.</p><p>I encourage everyone to reflect on how the historical data aligns—or conflicts—with your own experience and priorities, and to share insights that may deepen our collective understanding. This is an opportunity to synthesize our perspectives and ensure we’re making decisions rooted in both evidence and our company’s values.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I welcome your thoughts on which patterns or lessons from our past investments you believe should guide us as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Belle Cantu</h4></p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I’ve observed that real estate has provided us with the most consistent and reliable returns this year, supporting both our financial objectives and the sense of stability that’s so important for our team. While stocks have offered higher returns in some quarters, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—underscores the risk to our cohesion and predictability. I believe our experience confirms that prioritizing real estate has supported not just steady growth, but also the trust and collaborative habits we value as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the importance of stability and the way real estate has reinforced our team’s trust and collaborative habits. Your point about stocks’ volatility is well taken—it’s a helpful reminder that while higher returns are appealing, predictability and cohesion remain core to our values and long-term strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I agree that maintaining predictability is essential for our team’s confidence and unity, especially as we continue to build our track record. At the same time, I think it’s important we remain open to regularly reassessing our risk tolerance, so we’re prepared to adapt if our collective comfort with risk evolves in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle—I agree that maintaining predictability has been foundational for our confidence and unity. I also appreciate your emphasis on regularly reassessing our risk tolerance; staying open to adaptation ensures we remain responsive to both market shifts and the evolving comfort of our team, which is essential for our continued growth and cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree with both Belle and Krish that real estate’s steady, moderate returns have not only supported our financial objectives but have also played a key role in building the trust and collaborative habits that define our team. Looking at the historical data, I see a clear pattern: while stocks can offer high returns, their volatility could easily disrupt the sense of confidence and unity we’ve worked so hard to cultivate. For me, the consistent performance of real estate has provided a reliable foundation for both our growth and our culture, which I believe should continue to guide our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I appreciate how you’ve connected the consistent performance of real estate to both our financial progress and the strong culture we’ve built together. Your observation about the risks of volatility with stocks is a valuable reminder that protecting our team’s confidence and unity is just as important as pursuing returns, and I agree that these lessons from our history should continue to guide our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on protecting team confidence and unity alongside financial growth.

<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I fully agree with the points raised so far—our experience this year has shown that real estate consistently delivers steady returns with moderate risk, directly supporting our goals for disciplined growth and a cohesive, trust-based culture. While stocks have occasionally produced higher gains, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—could undermine the stability and confidence we’ve worked hard to establish. I believe the historical data confirms that maintaining our focus on real estate has been essential to both our financial progress and the unity of our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I appreciate how you’ve clearly articulated the link between real estate’s steady returns and the disciplined, trust-based culture we’ve cultivated.

Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the connection between steady returns and our team’s cohesion. I’d add that by grounding our decisions in proven reliability, we not only strengthen our current foundation but also create the confidence needed to thoughtfully consider new opportunities as our experience grows. This approach helps ensure we remain adaptable without sacrificing the trust and stability that have become hallmarks of our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I agree that grounding our decisions in proven reliability not only strengthens our foundation but also gives us the confidence and flexibility to thoughtfully explore new opportunities as our experience grows. This balanced approach—valuing both stability and adaptability—will be essential as we continue to evolve as a team and pursue our company’s goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree that maintaining this balance will be key as we move forward. By continuing to apply the same discipline and open dialogue that have guided our real estate decisions, we’ll be well-positioned to evaluate other options—like stocks or bonds—if our collective risk appetite changes. This process will help us preserve trust and unity, even as we consider adapting our strategy in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>

Isaac Bates: &quot;I agree with what’s been shared—our experience has shown that real estate’s consistent, moderate returns have been key to both our financial progress and the strong sense of trust and unity within our team. While stocks have produced some impressive gains, the volatility we saw in Q2 serves as a reminder that predictability and stability are critical for sustaining our momentum and confidence. I believe the lessons from our historical performance point clearly to real estate as the asset that best aligns with our goals for steady growth and a collaborative, resilient culture.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac.

CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Isaac.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Krish Greer UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 75%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The universal consensus among shareholders that real estate’s consistent, moderate returns have supported not only our financial progress but also the trust and disciplined habits at the core of our company culture; the CEO’s strong affirmation that real estate aligns with our priorities for predictability and stability; repeated emphasis from multiple participants that stocks’ volatility remains at odds with our current need for cohesion and confidence; the group’s commitment to regular reassessment and openness to adapting our strategy as experience grows.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my conviction that our historical experience with real estate has not only delivered steady growth but has been instrumental in building a resilient, unified team. I’ve become even more aware of how closely our financial decisions are intertwined with our cultural objectives, and the value of consensus in reinforcing both. While I remain open to reassessing our risk appetite in the future, the clarity and alignment in this round have increased my confidence that real estate remains the most responsible and unifying choice for this quarter.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: The steady, moderate returns of real estate have proven to be the most reliable foundation for both our financial objectives and the collaborative, disciplined culture we value. The absence of any disagreement and the strong, shared commitment to stability and trust reinforce my belief that real estate is best suited to our current stage and market environment. While stocks offer higher potential gains, their volatility is not aligned with our priorities right now. Bonds and cash, though safe, do not provide the growth we need. Real estate continues to offer the best balance of risk and return for our team.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus around Real Estate as the preferred investment, I believe it is important to proceed with another round focused on assessing our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values. This will allow us to surface any evolving perspectives, ensure that all shareholders—especially quieter voices—have the opportunity to share their comfort levels, and confirm that our decision continues to reflect both our financial objectives and the collaborative, adaptable culture we are building. By inviting deeper reflection on risk and adaptability, we can reinforce our commitment to inclusivity and make a more robust, future-oriented decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current risk tolerance and alignment with company values | Expected outcome: Surface individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels, clarify any evolving priorities, and determine whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because the consistent, moderate returns from real estate have not only advanced our financial goals but have also played a crucial role in nurturing a collaborative, resilient culture—something every shareholder highlighted as essential. While stocks offer higher upside, their volatility remains at odds with our current priorities of predictability and team unity. Bonds and cash, though safe, do not provide the growth we need at this stage. Real estate continues to best balance our goals for steady growth, disciplined habits, and cultural cohesion, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I invite us to assess our current risk tolerance and how our priorities may have evolved, with the goal of surfacing individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels and determining if our collective appetite for risk has shifted. By sharing our honest views, we can deepen our understanding of each option’s alignment with our values and ensure our decision reflects the full spectrum of shareholder comfort. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any thoughts or concerns that might help us clarify our risk tolerance and strengthen our collective decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I continue to feel that our current risk tolerance is best reflected by prioritizing steady, moderate growth, especially given how real estate has supported both our financial objectives and the trust-based culture we’ve built this year.

<h4>Exchange with Krish Greer</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it’s important to reaffirm how our current risk tolerance aligns with both our financial objectives and our company culture, especially since consensus can sometimes mask quieter concerns.</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I continue to feel that real estate best reflects our group’s current appetite for moderate, steady growth without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. The consistency we’ve seen so far has not only advanced our financial position but also strengthened our team’s trust and discipline, which I see as foundational to our long-term success.

CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for highlighting the value of surfacing any differing views or emerging concerns—your openness helps ensure our decision is genuinely representative and robust. I want to reiterate that if anyone is considering a shift toward stocks, bonds, or even cash, or has reservations about our current approach, now is the perfect time to share those thoughts. Our goal is to make a decision that everyone can stand behind with confidence, knowing all perspectives have been thoughtfully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the importance of inclusivity and offers a chance to further encourage participation from all shareholders, which could help surface any remaining reservations or evolving perspectives before we finalize our decision.</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I fully agree, Delores—ensuring every voice is heard is essential for both a sound financial decision and a healthy team culture. If anyone has even a small reservation about real estate or sees a compelling case for cash, bonds, or stocks in light of our current risk tolerance, now is the ideal time to bring that forward. I’m confident that integrating every viewpoint will only strengthen our decision and reinforce our shared commitment to transparency and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>

While I appreciate the open invitation to explore other options, I haven’t seen a shift in our collective appetite for risk—especially given the volatility stocks have shown and the limited growth from bonds and cash. Regularly reassessing our comfort with risk is important, but for now, maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate seems best aligned with both our values and our objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for articulating how our disciplined approach with real estate continues to align with both our risk tolerance and the collaborative culture we’ve built.

- Real Estate: 80%<br>
- Stocks: 5%</p><p>KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The continued, unanimous consensus among all shareholders that real estate’s steady, moderate returns best match our current risk tolerance and company culture; the CEO’s repeated affirmation that real estate supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative, disciplined environment we value; the group’s strong emphasis on inclusivity, transparency, and regular reassessment of risk tolerance, ensuring our decision reflects the full spectrum of comfort within the team; acknowledgment that while stocks offer higher returns, their volatility remains misaligned with our priorities for predictability and trust at this stage; no new compelling arguments surfaced for shifting toward bonds, cash, or stocks.</p><p>METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has further reinforced my conviction that our disciplined, steady approach with real estate not only advances our financial goals but also strengthens the unity and resilience of our team. I’ve become even more attuned to the importance of inclusivity and open dialogue in surfacing any quieter concerns, recognizing that true consensus is built on ensuring every voice is heard.

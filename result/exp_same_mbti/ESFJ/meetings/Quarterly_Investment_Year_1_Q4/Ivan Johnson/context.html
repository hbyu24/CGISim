<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Ivan Johnson’s Reflection on the Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C, favoring the full allocation of 100% of our funds evenly distributed across the four quarters. My position was grounded in the belief that, given the stable and predictable market conditions, this approach best balances maximizing growth potential with spreading risk evenly. I emphasized the inclusivity and fairness of this option, highlighting how it supports disciplined investment habits and fosters shared confidence among shareholders.</p><p>The CEO, Delores Booth, responded positively to my input, echoing my preference for Option C and appreciating my focus on fairness and balancing opportunity with reassurance. She acknowledged the merits of the more conservative Option A but maintained her confidence in Option C as the optimal strategy. Other shareholders, notably Jasper Meza, also supported Option C, reinforcing a collective momentum towards this choice. Meanwhile, shareholders like Belle Cantu advocated for Option A’s caution, valuing its cash reserve for flexibility.</p><p>The final vote was unanimous (6 out of 6) in favor of Option C, reflecting a strong consensus. My preferred option was adopted without opposition, confirming that the group aligned with the approach I championed throughout the discussion.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated strong leadership by framing the meeting with a clear overview of market conditions and setting a focused theme for each discussion round. She skillfully encouraged open dialogue and balanced consideration of all viewpoints, as seen when she integrated shareholder feedback and emphasized both financial and cultural factors in her summaries.</p><p>Where the CEO excelled was in fostering a collaborative atmosphere that valued transparency and mutual respect. For example, her acknowledgment of the psychological comfort provided by Option A’s cash reserve showed sensitivity to shareholder concerns beyond pure financial metrics. However, she could further improve by proactively inviting more direct engagement from quieter shareholders to ensure all voices are heard equally, potentially enriching the decision-making process.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process this meeting worked effectively, with structured rounds that progressively deepened understanding and consensus. The approach allowed shareholders to weigh both immediate financial outcomes and long-term cultural implications, culminating in a well-supported final decision. The unanimous approval of Option C indicates the decision was sound and aligned with the company’s stable market environment and growth objectives.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing quantitative financial analysis with qualitative cultural considerations in group decision-making. I learned that even in a stable market, acknowledging the psychological and team dynamics aspects—such as reassurance and trust-building—can significantly influence consensus-building.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to further emphasize the value of open communication and collective learning, as these elements proved crucial in aligning diverse perspectives. I might also strive to engage more reticent shareholders to uncover hidden concerns or ideas that could refine our strategies.</p><p>A noticeable pattern was how repeated acknowledgments of both growth and caution helped bridge differing positions, suggesting that framing options in terms of complementary strengths rather than opposition facilitates agreement. My key takeaway is that fostering a culture of trust, inclusivity, and adaptability is as vital as the technical merits of any proposal. This insight will guide me to advocate not only for sound financial choices but also for processes that strengthen team cohesion and long-term resilience.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Ivan Johnson’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained a consistent and clear position advocating for investing in real estate for the first quarter. I emphasized that real estate’s moderate risk and steady appreciation align well with our company’s goals of disciplined growth, fostering trust, and building a collaborative culture in this stable market environment. Throughout the discussion rounds, I underscored real estate’s unique ability to unify differing risk preferences among shareholders while promoting confidence and inclusive decision-making habits.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded very positively to my input, frequently acknowledging the cultural as well as financial merits of real estate. She reinforced my points by highlighting the importance of building team confidence and establishing a precedent of thoughtful, balanced decision-making. Our exchanges deepened the shared understanding that real estate serves as common ground for both risk-averse and growth-oriented shareholders. Other shareholders, including Krish Greer, Isaac Bates, Jasper Meza, and Belle Cantu, echoed and supported this perspective, creating a strong consensus.</p><p>Voting outcomes reflected unanimous support, with all 6 shareholders approving the proposal to invest in real estate. The final company decision aligned perfectly with my preferred option, confirming broad agreement on this balanced and prudent approach for our inaugural quarter.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated commendable leadership throughout the meeting. She set clear themes for each discussion round, framing complex financial concepts in an accessible way and emphasizing both quantitative risk-return profiles and qualitative cultural factors. For instance, her repeated recognition of the importance of team confidence and trust-building—alongside financial prudence—helped shape a collaborative and inclusive atmosphere.</p><p>One area where the CEO could improve is in actively encouraging more participation from quieter shareholders earlier in the discussion. While the dialogue was thorough, ensuring equitable engagement might surface additional perspectives and further enrich decision-making. Nonetheless, Delores showed sensitivity by acknowledging potential liquidity concerns with real estate and invited open communication on these issues, reinforcing adaptability.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was well-structured and effective. The two-round discussion allowed us to first build a shared understanding of asset risk-return profiles and then surface key priorities and concerns, culminating in a unanimous vote with no objections. This methodical approach balanced financial analysis and team dynamics, resulting in a final decision that is well-suited for our stable market context and supports both growth and cultural cohesion.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced my belief that financial decisions for our company must integrate both quantitative analysis and cultural considerations. I learned that openly addressing even minor concerns—such as liquidity constraints with real estate—strengthens the team’s trust and adaptability, rather than undermining consensus. The willingness of all shareholders to engage transparently around these issues fosters resilience and collective confidence.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing the importance of linking financial strategy with team dynamics, and I will seek to encourage more inclusive participation from all shareholders to capture diverse viewpoints early. I also recognize the value in framing options as complementary rather than oppositional to build consensus more effectively.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged: unanimous agreement was facilitated by repeatedly acknowledging both growth potential and prudence, which helped bridge differing risk tolerances. My key takeaway is that fostering a culture of open communication, adaptability, and shared values is as critical as selecting sound financial options. Going forward, I will advocate not only for prudent investments but also for decision-making processes that strengthen our company’s unity and long-term success.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Ivan Johnson’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During the Q2 meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in real estate, aligning with my initial assessment that it offers the best balance of steady growth and moderate risk in our stable market environment. I emphasized the importance of maintaining disciplined growth while fostering trust and cohesion within the shareholder team. When I spoke in Round 1, I highlighted how last quarter’s real estate investment yielded reliable returns that strengthened our financial base and team confidence. The CEO, Delores Booth, responded positively to my contributions, acknowledging the value I placed on inclusivity and disciplined progress, and she encouraged ongoing reflection on risk tolerance as confidence builds.</p><p>Throughout the discussion rounds, other shareholders echoed similar sentiments, reinforcing the collective preference for real estate over higher-risk options like stocks at this time. The CEO maintained her support for real estate, framing it as the optimal investment given our objectives and the stable market conditions. Voting culminated in a unanimous 6 out of 6 approval in favor of investing in real estate for this quarter. My preferred option was fully adopted, reflecting strong consensus and alignment with my position.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by guiding the meeting with clarity and openness. She effectively framed the discussions around both quantitative financial data and qualitative cultural factors, fostering an inclusive atmosphere where all shareholders felt encouraged to share their views. For example, her summaries thoughtfully integrated shareholder feedback on balancing growth and stability, and she consistently emphasized transparency and intentionality in decision-making.</p><p>One area for improvement could be earlier and more proactive engagement of quieter shareholders to ensure their perspectives surface promptly, potentially enriching deliberations further. However, the CEO’s facilitation ensured that all voices were ultimately heard, and her steady encouragement of self-assessment on risk tolerance enhanced group cohesion.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process worked smoothly, utilizing structured rounds that built a shared factual foundation before moving toward consensus. This method allowed for deliberate consideration of both financial returns and team dynamics, culminating in a well-supported and unanimous decision. The final choice to invest in real estate appears well-suited to the company’s current stage, market conditions, and cultural priorities, balancing disciplined growth with trust-building.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced for me the critical importance of integrating both financial metrics and team culture into investment decisions. I learned that consistent communication about risk tolerance and regular opportunities for self-assessment foster trust and inclusivity, which in turn support stronger consensus and better long-term outcomes.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing the balance between stability and adaptability and to encourage even broader participation, particularly from those who may initially hesitate to voice their views. Recognizing patterns, I observed that framing options as complementary—such as steady real estate growth supporting future openness to stocks—helps bridge differing risk preferences and facilitates agreement.</p><p>Key takeaways include the value of disciplined, transparent processes that explicitly connect financial goals with the company’s evolving culture. This insight will guide me to advocate not only for prudent investment choices but also for decision-making practices that deepen team cohesion and prepare us to adapt thoughtfully as our confidence and market conditions evolve.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Ivan Johnson’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this Q3 meeting, I maintained my strong advocacy for investing in real estate, consistent with my prior positions. I emphasized real estate’s reliable, moderate returns in our stable market environment, framing it as the best balance between steady financial growth and fostering the trust and disciplined culture we’ve established as a shareholder team. I articulated that while bonds and cash offer safety, they do not sufficiently support our growth goals, and stocks carry volatility risks that could destabilize our collective confidence.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded very positively to my inputs, affirming the importance of balancing reliability with team cohesion and appreciating my emphasis on building a foundation of trust and adaptability. Throughout the discussion rounds, the CEO integrated my perspectives within her broader framing of disciplined, inclusive decision-making. The other shareholders unanimously echoed support for real estate, reinforcing a cohesive group consensus.</p><p>The voting outcome was unanimous: all six shareholders, including myself, approved the proposal to invest in real estate this quarter. My preferred option was adopted fully, reflecting strong alignment between my position, the CEO’s recommendation, and the shareholder body’s consensus.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by structuring the meeting into focused rounds that encouraged thorough exploration of historical data, risk tolerance, and company values. She skillfully balanced quantitative financial analysis with qualitative cultural factors, consistently fostering an atmosphere of openness and mutual respect. For example, her summaries explicitly connected real estate’s steady returns with the reinforcement of team trust and disciplined habits, resonating with shareholder values.</p><p>The CEO’s facilitation was inclusive, though I noted room for improvement in proactively inviting more direct input from quieter shareholders earlier in discussions to ensure all voices are equally heard. Nonetheless, her steady encouragement of ongoing reassessment and adaptability created a strong foundation for collaborative decision-making.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process functioned very effectively in this meeting. The two-round discussion format allowed the team to build shared factual understanding before candidly assessing risk tolerance and alignment with company culture. The unanimous vote for real estate demonstrates that the process successfully integrated diverse perspectives into a clear, well-supported decision. I believe this final decision is highly appropriate for our current stable market context and company objectives, balancing disciplined growth with the cultivation of a cohesive, trust-based team culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced my conviction that investment decisions must harmonize rigorous financial analysis with deep consideration of team dynamics and shared values. I learned that consistent, transparent dialogue about risk tolerance and adaptability fosters trust and inclusivity, which are critical for sustainable consensus and long-term success.</p><p>In future meetings, I plan to emphasize even more the importance of engaging all shareholders early and encouraging quieter members to voice their views, as this could enrich our deliberations and uncover valuable insights. I also intend to continue framing options as complementary rather than competitive, which has proven effective in bridging differing risk preferences and reinforcing group cohesion.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged in how repeated affirmations of steady growth and disciplined progress aligned with company values helped unify the team around real estate as the prudent choice. My key takeaway is that nurturing a culture of trust, openness, and adaptability is as vital as selecting sound financial options. Moving forward, I will advocate not only for balanced, disciplined investments but also for processes that strengthen our company’s unity, resilience, and readiness to evolve thoughtfully as circumstances change.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26265.62 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Delores Booth : Reviewing our historical data, we see that real estate has consistently provided steady, moderate returns with minimal volatility, aligning well with our goals for stability and disciplined growth in a stable market. In contrast, stocks have shown the highest potential gains but also significant risk, while bonds and cash have delivered predictable but more modest returns. This pattern suggests that continuing to prioritize real estate supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative, trust-based culture we value as a team.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Ivan Johnson CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I believe real estate remains the most balanced and reliable choice for our company in this stable market, offering steady growth with moderate risk while reinforcing the trust and disciplined culture we have built together. Our historical experience this year has demonstrated that real estate delivers consistent returns and supports a collaborative environment, which is especially important to me as someone who values fairness and inclusivity. While stocks have shown higher potential gains, their volatility could undermine the confidence and cohesion we’ve worked hard to establish. Bonds and cash, though safe, do not sufficiently support our growth objectives at this stage. Overall, real estate best aligns with both our financial goals and the supportive, team-oriented culture I want to foster.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared factual foundation and identify patterns in risk and return that have supported our company’s stability and growth&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because as I reflect on our company’s priorities and the steady results we’ve achieved so far, I feel most confident in real estate for this quarter. Real estate has delivered reliable, moderate returns with manageable risk, which aligns with my commitment to providing stability and nurturing trust within our team. While stocks are tempting due to their high recent returns, their volatility in this stable market still gives me pause, especially since our group values predictability and cohesion. Bonds and cash, though safe, don’t offer the growth we need at this stage. I believe real estate best supports both our financial goals and the collaborative, disciplined culture we are building together, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this first round, let’s focus on reviewing the historical performance of each asset class and the lessons we’ve learned so far. By surfacing concrete patterns in risk and return, we can establish a shared factual foundation that will inform our decision for this quarter.</p><p>I encourage everyone to reflect on how the historical data aligns—or conflicts—with your own experience and priorities, and to share insights that may deepen our collective understanding. This is an opportunity to synthesize our perspectives and ensure we’re making decisions rooted in both evidence and our company’s values.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I welcome your thoughts on which patterns or lessons from our past investments you believe should guide us as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Belle Cantu</h4></p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I’ve observed that real estate has provided us with the most consistent and reliable returns this year, supporting both our financial objectives and the sense of stability that’s so important for our team. While stocks have offered higher returns in some quarters, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—underscores the risk to our cohesion and predictability. I believe our experience confirms that prioritizing real estate has supported not just steady growth, but also the trust and collaborative habits we value as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the importance of stability and the way real estate has reinforced our team’s trust and collaborative habits. Your point about stocks’ volatility is well taken—it’s a helpful reminder that while higher returns are appealing, predictability and cohesion remain core to our values and long-term strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I agree that maintaining predictability is essential for our team’s confidence and unity, especially as we continue to build our track record. At the same time, I think it’s important we remain open to regularly reassessing our risk tolerance, so we’re prepared to adapt if our collective comfort with risk evolves in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle—I agree that maintaining predictability has been foundational for our confidence and unity. I also appreciate your emphasis on regularly reassessing our risk tolerance; staying open to adaptation ensures we remain responsive to both market shifts and the evolving comfort of our team, which is essential for our continued growth and cohesion.&quot;</p><p><br>

The volatility we’ve seen with stocks, especially the negative quarter, highlights the importance of prioritizing predictability and stability at this stage. I believe our experience confirms that focusing on real estate has not only benefited our financial results but also strengthened our team’s unity and confidence, which I see as equally important to our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish. I appreciate how you’ve drawn the link between steady financial results and the strength of our team’s unity and confidence.

<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute regarding the connection between real estate’s performance and our company’s culture, and I want to reinforce the value of balancing steady growth with trust and inclusivity, building on Belle and Krish’s thoughtful points.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree with both Belle and Krish that real estate’s steady, moderate returns have not only supported our financial objectives but have also played a key role in building the trust and collaborative habits that define our team.

CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I appreciate how you’ve connected the consistent performance of real estate to both our financial progress and the strong culture we’ve built together.

Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms the importance of trust and predictability, and I see value in highlighting how our shared commitment to these principles can serve as a touchstone for evaluating all future options, not just real estate.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I completely agree, Delores. Keeping trust and predictability at the forefront gives us a strong foundation to evaluate all our options each quarter, whether that leads us to continue with real estate or thoughtfully consider other assets as our confidence grows. This shared commitment will help us remain both disciplined and adaptable as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I fully agree with the points raised so far—our experience this year has shown that real estate consistently delivers steady returns with moderate risk, directly supporting our goals for disciplined growth and a cohesive, trust-based culture. While stocks have occasionally produced higher gains, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—could undermine the stability and confidence we’ve worked hard to establish. I believe the historical data confirms that maintaining our focus on real estate has been essential to both our financial progress and the unity of our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I appreciate how you’ve clearly articulated the link between real estate’s steady returns and the disciplined, trust-based culture we’ve cultivated.

Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the connection between steady returns and our team’s cohesion. I’d add that by grounding our decisions in proven reliability, we not only strengthen our current foundation but also create the confidence needed to thoughtfully consider new opportunities as our experience grows. This approach helps ensure we remain adaptable without sacrificing the trust and stability that have become hallmarks of our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I agree that grounding our decisions in proven reliability not only strengthens our foundation but also gives us the confidence and flexibility to thoughtfully explore new opportunities as our experience grows. This balanced approach—valuing both stability and adaptability—will be essential as we continue to evolve as a team and pursue our company’s goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree that maintaining this balance will be key as we move forward. By continuing to apply the same discipline and open dialogue that have guided our real estate decisions, we’ll be well-positioned to evaluate other options—like stocks or bonds—if our collective risk appetite changes. This process will help us preserve trust and unity, even as we consider adapting our strategy in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Isaac Bates: &quot;I agree with what’s been shared—our experience has shown that real estate’s consistent, moderate returns have been key to both our financial progress and the strong sense of trust and unity within our team. While stocks have produced some impressive gains, the volatility we saw in Q2 serves as a reminder that predictability and stability are critical for sustaining our momentum and confidence. I believe the lessons from our historical performance point clearly to real estate as the asset that best aligns with our goals for steady growth and a collaborative, resilient culture.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth summarized: &quot;Delores Booth **Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q4 – Round 1 Summary**  <br>
**Theme:** Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned  <br>
**Objective:** Establish a shared factual foundation and identify patterns in risk and return that have supported our company’s stability and growth</p><p>---</p><p>**1. Restatement of Theme and Objective**  <br>
This round focused on reviewing the historical performance of each asset class and surfacing the key lessons learned from our investment experience to date. The goal was to synthesize these insights into a shared factual foundation that will inform our decision for this quarter.</p><p>**2. Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
All shareholders who participated—Belle Cantu, Krish Greer, Ivan Johnson, Jasper Meza, Isaac Bates, and myself—expressed strong support for Real Estate as the asset that has best served both our financial objectives and the development of a collaborative, trust-based culture.  <br>
- **Belle Cantu** emphasized real estate’s consistent, reliable returns and its role in fostering team stability and trust, while noting the volatility of stocks and the need for ongoing risk reassessment.  <br>
- **Krish Greer** reinforced the importance of steady growth and disciplined habits, drawing a direct link between real estate’s performance and team unity, and underscored the need for continual learning and flexibility.  <br>
- **Ivan Johnson** highlighted the pattern of real estate providing a reliable foundation for growth and culture, cautioning that stock volatility could undermine confidence and unity; he advocated for prioritizing trust and predictability with openness to periodic reassessment.  <br>
- **Jasper Meza** succinctly connected real estate’s steady returns to disciplined growth and team cohesion, noting that reliability builds the confidence needed to thoughtfully consider new opportunities as experience grows.  <br>

Arguments and Evidence Presented for Different Options**  <br>
- **Real Estate:** Cited by all as delivering consistent, moderate returns with manageable risk. Historical data confirms steady growth in Q1 and Q3, and a flat but stable result in Q2; this reliability has fostered trust, discipline, and a supportive culture.  <br>
- **Stocks:** Recognized for high potential returns (notably in Q1 and Q3), but also for significant volatility and risk (notably a -10% return in Q2). The group consistently agreed that this volatility is at odds with our current priorities of predictability, stability, and team cohesion.  <br>
- **Bonds and Cash:** Briefly acknowledged as safe, low-risk options, but not seriously considered due to their lower growth potential, which does not align with our current stage or objectives.</p><p>**4. Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- **Consensus:** Unanimous agreement that real estate has provided the most consistent and reliable returns, directly supporting both financial and cultural goals. All shareholders see predictability, stability, and disciplined habits as essential to our continued progress.  <br>
- **Disagreement:** No explicit disagreements surfaced. There was universal alignment around real estate as the most suitable asset for our current context, with a shared openness to reassessing risk tolerance and exploring new options as the company matures.</p><p>**5. Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
Significant progress was made in establishing a shared factual foundation. The group clearly identified patterns in risk and return, confirming that real estate best supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative culture we value. The discussion also surfaced a collective commitment to regular self-assessment and adaptability as our experience and confidence grow.</p><p>**6. Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our available investment choices remain strictly limited to: **Cash**, **Bonds**, **Real Estate**, and **Stocks**. All discussion this round appropriately focused on these predefined options.</p><p>**7. Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we will assess our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values, clarifying whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted and how this should influence our asset selection for this quarter. I encourage everyone to reflect on whether our historical experience has affected your comfort with risk, so we can ensure our decision continues to support both our financial objectives and the collaborative culture we are building together.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued that real estate’s steady, moderate returns have not only supported our financial goals but also fostered the trust and collaborative culture essential to our team’s cohesion.

The CEO, Delores Booth, responded positively, affirming the importance of balancing financial growth with protecting team trust and emphasizing that these lessons should continue to guide our decisions. We agreed on prioritizing predictability and inclusivity, with the CEO endorsing periodic reassessment of risk tolerance to maintain adaptability. No disagreements arose between us, reflecting a shared commitment to disciplined, trust-centered investment aligned with our company values.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>

Each highlighted the importance of disciplined growth, ongoing reassessment of risk tolerance, and maintaining stability to build confidence and adaptability. There were no notable disagreements; instead, a clear consensus emerged around real estate as the most suitable asset given the company’s current goals and market conditions.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Ivan Johnson UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 75%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The unanimous support from all shareholders and the CEO for real estate, combined with repeated emphasis on its role in fostering team trust, stability, and disciplined growth, has further solidified my confidence. The group’s recognition that stock volatility could undermine our culture, despite potential for higher returns, also reinforced my lower confidence in stocks. The continued commitment to periodic risk reassessment ensures adaptability without sacrificing our core priorities.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my appreciation for how closely our financial decisions are tied to the culture and trust we’ve built as a team. Hearing others articulate the same link between steady returns and a resilient, collaborative environment reinforced my own perspective and made me more confident that our approach is both prudent and inclusive. I’m more aware than ever that protecting our team’s unity and predictability is just as important as pursuing growth, and that disciplined, open dialogue is key to our long-term success.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: After reflecting on the historical data and the strong consensus among shareholders, I am even more convinced that real estate remains the most balanced and reliable option for this quarter. Its consistent, moderate returns have supported both our financial progress and the trust-based, disciplined culture we value. While stocks offer higher upside, the risks to team cohesion and predictability outweigh the potential gains at this stage. Real estate best aligns with our goals for sustainable growth and a resilient, inclusive company.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus around Real Estate as the preferred investment, I believe it is important to proceed with another round focused on assessing our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values. This will allow us to surface any evolving perspectives, ensure that all shareholders—especially quieter voices—have the opportunity to share their comfort levels, and confirm that our decision continues to reflect both our financial objectives and the collaborative, adaptable culture we are building. By inviting deeper reflection on risk and adaptability, we can reinforce our commitment to inclusivity and make a more robust, future-oriented decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current risk tolerance and alignment with company values | Expected outcome: Surface individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels, clarify any evolving priorities, and determine whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because the consistent, moderate returns from real estate have not only advanced our financial goals but have also played a crucial role in nurturing a collaborative, resilient culture—something every shareholder highlighted as essential. While stocks offer higher upside, their volatility remains at odds with our current priorities of predictability and team unity. Bonds and cash, though safe, do not provide the growth we need at this stage. Real estate continues to best balance our goals for steady growth, disciplined habits, and cultural cohesion, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I invite us to assess our current risk tolerance and how our priorities may have evolved, with the goal of surfacing individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels and determining if our collective appetite for risk has shifted. By sharing our honest views, we can deepen our understanding of each option’s alignment with our values and ensure our decision reflects the full spectrum of shareholder comfort. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any thoughts or concerns that might help us clarify our risk tolerance and strengthen our collective decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to reaffirm how my perspective on risk tolerance and company values aligns with the group, and to help ensure that all voices are heard as we assess whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I continue to feel that our current risk tolerance is best reflected by prioritizing steady, moderate growth, especially given how real estate has supported both our financial objectives and the trust-based culture we’ve built this year. While I’m open to reassessing our approach as we gain more experience, I believe maintaining this balanced strategy is the most responsible way to preserve our unity and confidence as a team. If others feel differently or see new opportunities in the current environment, I’d appreciate hearing those perspectives so we can ensure our decision truly reflects everyone’s comfort level.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan, for articulating the importance of balancing steady growth with team unity—your emphasis on preserving confidence and trust truly resonates. I also appreciate your openness to hearing alternative perspectives, as this will help us ensure our decision is inclusive and forward-looking. I encourage anyone who feels differently or has evolving priorities to share their thoughts now, so we can make a fully informed decision that reflects our collective risk tolerance.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the value of inclusivity and invites further reflection, providing an opportunity for me to reinforce the importance of open dialogue and encourage input from quieter shareholders, which could deepen our collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your encouragement for open dialogue, Delores. I want to reiterate that hearing from those who may not have spoken yet is especially valuable, as even a single new perspective could help us refine our understanding of risk and ensure our decision is truly representative of the whole team. If anyone has reservations or sees potential in other options—whether that’s stocks, bonds, or cash—I’d be eager to hear your thoughts so we can move forward with complete confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you for highlighting the importance of hearing from every voice, Ivan. I completely agree that even a single new perspective could meaningfully enhance our understanding of risk and help us make the most balanced, representative decision possible. I encourage anyone who hasn’t yet spoken, or who may have reservations about our current direction, to share their thoughts on the relative merits and risks of cash, bonds, real estate, or stocks, so we can move forward with clarity and confidence as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I have already emphasized the importance of inclusivity and encouraged input from all shareholders, and the CEO has fully acknowledged and reinforced this message. At this point, further reiteration would not add significant new value to the discussion.</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

The consistency we’ve seen so far has not only advanced our financial position but also strengthened our team’s trust and discipline, which I see as foundational to our long-term success. I’m open to revisiting our risk profile as we gain more experience, but at this stage, I believe maintaining this balanced approach is the most responsible and unifying path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

Even with strong consensus, I think it’s valuable to explicitly invite any differing views or emerging concerns about our risk profile—sometimes these can surface new insights or help us refine our collective approach. If anyone is considering a shift toward options like stocks or bonds, or feels that our priorities should evolve, I’d welcome hearing those thoughts so we can ensure our decision truly reflects the full spectrum of comfort within the group.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for highlighting the value of surfacing any differing views or emerging concerns—your openness helps ensure our decision is genuinely representative and robust. I want to reiterate that if anyone is considering a shift toward stocks, bonds, or even cash, or has reservations about our current approach, now is the perfect time to share those thoughts. Our goal is to make a decision that everyone can stand behind with confidence, knowing all perspectives have been thoughtfully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I fully agree, Delores—ensuring every voice is heard is essential for both a sound financial decision and a healthy team culture. If anyone has even a small reservation about real estate or sees a compelling case for cash, bonds, or stocks in light of our current risk tolerance, now is the ideal time to bring that forward. I’m confident that integrating every viewpoint will only strengthen our decision and reinforce our shared commitment to transparency and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Isaac Bates</h4></p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I continue to believe that real estate best matches our team’s appetite for moderate risk and steady growth, especially given how it’s supported both our financial progress and the trust we’ve built together this year. That said, I value the invitation to reassess our comfort with risk and remain open to hearing if anyone feels a shift toward stocks, bonds, or cash would better serve our priorities at this stage.

While I appreciate the open invitation to explore other options, I haven’t seen a shift in our collective appetite for risk—especially given the volatility stocks have shown and the limited growth from bonds and cash. Regularly reassessing our comfort with risk is important, but for now, maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate seems best aligned with both our values and our objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for articulating how our disciplined approach with real estate continues to align with both our risk tolerance and the collaborative culture we’ve built.

For now, maintaining this steady course reinforces both our financial foundation and the collaborative, resilient culture that will enable us to navigate new opportunities together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for underscoring that disciplined consistency with real estate now doesn’t limit our ability to adapt as our confidence and experience increase. I agree that maintaining this steady course strengthens both our financial foundation and our collaborative culture, while keeping us ready to thoughtfully evaluate higher-risk options in the future. If anyone else has further thoughts on our current risk appetite or sees a reason to revisit other options, please share—your input will help ensure our decision is both robust and future-ready.&quot;</p><p><br>

Hearing every shareholder reaffirm the link between real estate’s steady returns and our team’s unity has made me even more confident in this approach.

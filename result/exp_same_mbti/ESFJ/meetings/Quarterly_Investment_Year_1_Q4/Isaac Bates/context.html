<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Isaac Bates’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During the meeting, I consistently supported Option C, advocating for a full, even allocation of 100% of our total funds spread evenly across the four quarters. I positioned this as the best balance between maximizing growth potential and fostering a collaborative, disciplined investment culture in a stable market. Throughout the discussions, I emphasized how Option C encourages momentum, team engagement, and steady progress, while still managing risk through even distribution.</p><p>My input was well received by CEO Delores Booth, who echoed many of my points about growth, inclusivity, and disciplined habits. She acknowledged my focus on balancing momentum with reassurance, which helped refine the group’s understanding of trade-offs between Options C and A. Other shareholders largely aligned with my position or recognized its merits, creating a strong consensus.</p><p>The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C, confirming that my preferred option was adopted. The company decided to allocate 100% of funds evenly across all quarters, reflecting the collaborative and growth-oriented direction I advocated.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated strong leadership by fostering an inclusive, balanced discussion centered on both financial outcomes and company culture. She excelled in clearly framing the meeting’s themes and encouraging shareholders to share perspectives. For example, her recognition of the value in both Options C and A helped create a respectful environment where diverse viewpoints were integrated rather than dismissed.</p><p>However, while Delores skillfully acknowledged the merits of the more conservative Option A, she maintained a clear preference for Option C without fully exploring potential contingencies if market conditions changed unexpectedly. Future improvements might include more proactive scenario planning to prepare the team for volatility or unforeseen risks.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process worked effectively, combining open dialogue with structured rounds that deepened understanding and gradually built consensus. The final unanimous vote indicates strong alignment and buy-in, suggesting a healthy governance culture.</p><p>Overall, I believe the final decision to adopt Option C is well-suited to the stable market context and company goals. It balances ambition with responsibility, supports disciplined investment habits, and sets a positive cultural tone for our first year.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of synthesizing both financial and cultural considerations in group decision-making. I learned that shareholders value not only numbers but also how a choice affects team confidence, trust, and long-term collaboration. The dynamic showed that building consensus requires actively acknowledging differing priorities—such as momentum versus caution—and framing them as complementary rather than conflicting.</p><p>Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing holistic perspectives that integrate risk management with company culture. I might also engage earlier to encourage scenario planning and contingency discussions. By anticipating concerns about flexibility and security, I can help the group feel more confident in proactive strategies.</p><p>A pattern I noticed is that shareholders, including the CEO, are receptive to balanced arguments that respect both growth ambitions and foundational reassurance. This suggests that future proposals combining these elements with clear communication will be well received.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the value of fostering inclusive dialogue, framing decisions in terms of shared values, and reinforcing the connection between financial strategy and team dynamics. These approaches enhance trust and support stronger, more resilient outcomes for the company.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Isaac Bates’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my strong support for investing our Q1 funds in real estate. I articulated that real estate’s steady appreciation and moderate risk profile align well with our company’s goals of disciplined growth, team confidence, and building an inclusive culture in this stable market environment. I acknowledged the liquidity concerns raised by other shareholders but emphasized that our structured quarterly allocation and commitment to open communication would effectively manage these constraints. CEO Delores Booth responded positively to my contributions, appreciating how I linked financial discipline with fostering cultural momentum and adaptability. Other shareholders unanimously supported real estate, with no dissenting opinions. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of investing in real estate, confirming that my preferred option was fully adopted.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated exemplary leadership by facilitating a transparent, inclusive discussion that balanced financial prudence with cultural considerations. She skillfully synthesized shareholder insights, particularly around real estate’s suitability and liquidity concerns, reinforcing the importance of adaptability and teamwork. For example, her responses to my emphasis on linking financial discipline and company culture helped deepen our shared understanding and commitment. One area for improvement might be to proactively initiate scenario planning or contingency strategies earlier, especially around liquidity or market shifts, to further strengthen our preparedness. The company’s decision-making process was highly effective, fostering consensus through structured rounds of focused dialogue that integrated diverse perspectives. The unanimous vote reflects strong alignment and trust. Overall, the final decision to invest in real estate is well-suited to our stable market context and supports both our financial objectives and the foundation of a resilient, collaborative company culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting underscored the critical role of integrating financial analysis with cultural and relational dynamics in group decision-making. I learned that shareholders, including the CEO, highly value approaches that balance growth with prudence while fostering trust and adaptability. The process revealed the power of proactively addressing potential concerns—such as liquidity—to build confidence and unity. Moving forward, I intend to continue emphasizing holistic perspectives that connect risk management, financial goals, and company culture. I also plan to encourage earlier discussions on contingencies and scenario planning to enhance our collective readiness. A pattern I observed is that well-articulated, balanced arguments that acknowledge both ambition and caution resonate deeply with the group and facilitate consensus. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of fostering inclusive dialogue, framing decisions in terms of shared values, and continuously reinforcing the link between financial strategy and team cohesion. These insights will guide me in contributing effectively to our company’s ongoing success and collaborative spirit.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Isaac Bates’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my consistent support for investing in real estate, emphasizing its steady returns and positive influence on team trust and disciplined culture. I articulated that real estate’s reliable 10% return in the previous quarter reinforced our financial foundation while fostering cohesion among shareholders. Throughout the discussions, I underscored the importance of a balanced, disciplined approach that minimizes unnecessary risk while allowing room for future reassessment as our confidence grows.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded very positively to my input, affirming the value of steady growth paired with intentional, transparent decision-making. She echoed my emphasis on maintaining momentum and cohesion before considering any significant shift toward higher-risk assets. Other shareholders showed strong alignment with my position, with no objections raised, reflecting a shared commitment to stability and trust-building.</p><p>The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of the CEO’s proposal to invest in real estate for this quarter. This confirmed that my preferred option was fully adopted, and the company decisively chose a path balancing steady growth and moderate risk consistent with our current priorities.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Delores Booth demonstrated excellent leadership by skillfully framing our discussions around both financial outcomes and the cultural values underpinning our company. She effectively fostered an inclusive and respectful environment where all shareholders could share their perspectives, particularly encouraging open dialogue about risk tolerance and the trade-offs between stability and growth. For example, her thoughtful responses to my points about intentionality and clarity helped deepen our collective understanding and consensus.</p><p>One area for potential improvement would be for the CEO to proactively initiate scenario planning or contingency discussions earlier in the process. While the current stable market environment supports our cautious approach, preparing for possible volatility or shifts in risk appetite could strengthen our readiness and adaptability.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process worked very well this meeting. Structured rounds of dialogue allowed us to build a shared factual foundation, explore evolving risk preferences, and ultimately reach unanimous agreement. This reflects a healthy governance culture that balances thorough analysis with inclusivity and trust.</p><p>Overall, I believe the final decision to invest in real estate is well aligned with the company’s current stage and market conditions. It supports disciplined financial growth while reinforcing the collaborative, trust-based culture essential to our long-term success.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the importance of integrating financial strategy with cultural and relational dynamics in group decision-making. I learned that shareholders deeply value approaches that not only optimize returns but also build confidence, trust, and cohesion within the team. Intentionality and transparency around risk tolerance emerged as crucial elements for sustaining alignment and momentum.</p><p>Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing holistic perspectives that connect risk management with cultural values, encouraging ongoing, open dialogue about evolving comfort with risk. I also recognize the benefit of advocating for earlier scenario planning to prepare the group for potential market changes or shifts in team confidence.</p><p>A notable pattern is the group’s strong preference for stability and disciplined progress at this stage, balanced with openness to reassessing risk tolerance as our collective confidence matures. This suggests that future proposals combining steady growth with clear communication and opportunities for incremental risk adjustment will resonate well.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the value of fostering inclusive discussion, framing decisions in terms of shared values and trust, and reinforcing the link between financial discipline and team cohesion.

<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Isaac Bates’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1, Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my consistent support for investing in real estate, emphasizing its steady returns and moderate risk profile within our stable market context. I positioned real estate as the optimal choice that not only drives financial growth but also reinforces the trust, discipline, and collaborative culture we have cultivated as a team. During the discussion, I contributed by highlighting how real estate’s historical performance has built our team’s confidence and prepared us for future adaptability, especially regarding the potential consideration of higher-return assets like stocks as our risk tolerance evolves.</p><p>CEO Delores Booth responded positively and appreciatively to my input, affirming the connection I made between disciplined investment choices and fostering a strong, inclusive company culture. Our exchanges deepened the shared understanding that while stocks hold appeal for future growth, their current volatility does not align with our collective risk appetite.</p><p>Other shareholders echoed similar views, resulting in unanimous support for real estate. The final vote was 6/6 in favor of the CEO’s proposal to invest in real estate for this quarter, confirming that my preferred option was fully adopted.</p><p>2.

<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Delores Booth opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26265.62 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Delores Booth : Reviewing our historical data, we see that real estate has consistently provided steady, moderate returns with minimal volatility, aligning well with our goals for stability and disciplined growth in a stable market. In contrast, stocks have shown the highest potential gains but also significant risk, while bonds and cash have delivered predictable but more modest returns. This pattern suggests that continuing to prioritize real estate supports both our financial objectives and the collaborative, trust-based culture we value as a team.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Isaac Bates CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 70%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I believe real estate remains the best fit for this quarter, given its track record of steady returns and moderate risk in our stable market. Our previous investments in real estate have not only yielded strong results but have also fostered trust and a disciplined, collaborative culture within our team—values I care deeply about as an ESFJ. While stocks offer tempting high returns, their volatility could undermine the steady progress and confidence we&#x27;ve built together. Bonds and cash, though safe, don&#x27;t provide the growth momentum our company needs at this stage. Maintaining our focus on real estate allows us to balance financial growth with stability and team cohesion, positioning us for continued success.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared factual foundation and identify patterns in risk and return that have supported our company’s stability and growth&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because as I reflect on our company’s priorities and the steady results we’ve achieved so far, I feel most confident in real estate for this quarter. Real estate has delivered reliable, moderate returns with manageable risk, which aligns with my commitment to providing stability and nurturing trust within our team. While stocks are tempting due to their high recent returns, their volatility in this stable market still gives me pause, especially since our group values predictability and cohesion. Bonds and cash, though safe, don’t offer the growth we need at this stage. I believe real estate best supports both our financial goals and the collaborative, disciplined culture we are building together, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this first round, let’s focus on reviewing the historical performance of each asset class and the lessons we’ve learned so far. By surfacing concrete patterns in risk and return, we can establish a shared factual foundation that will inform our decision for this quarter.</p><p>I encourage everyone to reflect on how the historical data aligns—or conflicts—with your own experience and priorities, and to share insights that may deepen our collective understanding. This is an opportunity to synthesize our perspectives and ensure we’re making decisions rooted in both evidence and our company’s values.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I welcome your thoughts on which patterns or lessons from our past investments you believe should guide us as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Belle Cantu</h4></p><p><br>
Belle Cantu: &quot;I’ve observed that real estate has provided us with the most consistent and reliable returns this year, supporting both our financial objectives and the sense of stability that’s so important for our team. While stocks have offered higher returns in some quarters, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—underscores the risk to our cohesion and predictability. I believe our experience confirms that prioritizing real estate has supported not just steady growth, but also the trust and collaborative habits we value as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the importance of stability and the way real estate has reinforced our team’s trust and collaborative habits.

<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I agree with both Belle and Krish that real estate’s steady, moderate returns have not only supported our financial objectives but have also played a key role in building the trust and collaborative habits that define our team. Looking at the historical data, I see a clear pattern: while stocks can offer high returns, their volatility could easily disrupt the sense of confidence and unity we’ve worked so hard to cultivate. For me, the consistent performance of real estate has provided a reliable foundation for both our growth and our culture, which I believe should continue to guide our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan. I appreciate how you’ve connected the consistent performance of real estate to both our financial progress and the strong culture we’ve built together. Your observation about the risks of volatility with stocks is a valuable reminder that protecting our team’s confidence and unity is just as important as pursuing returns, and I agree that these lessons from our history should continue to guide our decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on protecting team confidence and unity alongside financial growth. As we continue to build our track record, I think it’s important that we keep prioritizing options that reinforce trust and predictability, while also remaining open to periodic reassessment as our experience deepens. This approach will help ensure our decisions support both sustainable results and the inclusive, resilient culture we value.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan.

<h4>Exchange with Jasper Meza</h4></p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I fully agree with the points raised so far—our experience this year has shown that real estate consistently delivers steady returns with moderate risk, directly supporting our goals for disciplined growth and a cohesive, trust-based culture. While stocks have occasionally produced higher gains, their volatility—especially the negative result in Q2—could undermine the stability and confidence we’ve worked hard to establish. I believe the historical data confirms that maintaining our focus on real estate has been essential to both our financial progress and the unity of our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I appreciate how you’ve clearly articulated the link between real estate’s steady returns and the disciplined, trust-based culture we’ve cultivated.

Jasper Meza: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the connection between steady returns and our team’s cohesion. I’d add that by grounding our decisions in proven reliability, we not only strengthen our current foundation but also create the confidence needed to thoughtfully consider new opportunities as our experience grows. This approach helps ensure we remain adaptable without sacrificing the trust and stability that have become hallmarks of our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper. I agree that grounding our decisions in proven reliability not only strengthens our foundation but also gives us the confidence and flexibility to thoughtfully explore new opportunities as our experience grows. This balanced approach—valuing both stability and adaptability—will be essential as we continue to evolve as a team and pursue our company’s goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jasper Meza: &quot;I agree that maintaining this balance will be key as we move forward. By continuing to apply the same discipline and open dialogue that have guided our real estate decisions, we’ll be well-positioned to evaluate other options—like stocks or bonds—if our collective risk appetite changes. This process will help us preserve trust and unity, even as we consider adapting our strategy in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>

**Theme:** Review of historical asset performance and lessons learned  <br>

- **Belle Cantu** emphasized real estate’s consistent, reliable returns and its role in fostering team stability and trust, while noting the volatility of stocks and the need for ongoing risk reassessment.  <br>

- **Stocks:** Recognized for high potential returns (notably in Q1 and Q3), but also for significant volatility and risk (notably a -10% return in Q2). The group consistently agreed that this volatility is at odds with our current priorities of predictability, stability, and team cohesion.  <br>

Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
Significant progress was made in establishing a shared factual foundation.

The discussion also surfaced a collective commitment to regular self-assessment and adaptability as our experience and confidence grow.</p><p>**6. Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our available investment choices remain strictly limited to: **Cash**, **Bonds**, **Real Estate**, and **Stocks**. All discussion this round appropriately focused on these predefined options.</p><p>**7. Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we will assess our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values, clarifying whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted and how this should influence our asset selection for this quarter. I encourage everyone to reflect on whether our historical experience has affected your comfort with risk, so we can ensure our decision continues to support both our financial objectives and the collaborative culture we are building together.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Isaac Bates UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 75%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The unanimous support from all shareholders and the CEO for real estate, grounded in its consistent, moderate returns and its proven role in fostering trust, disciplined habits, and team cohesion, significantly reinforced my confidence. The repeated emphasis on predictability, stability, and the cultural benefits of real estate—along with the collective recognition that stock volatility poses risks to our unity—further solidified my preference. The shared commitment to regular self-assessment and adaptability as our experience grows also resonated with my values, supporting a disciplined yet open-minded approach.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become even more attuned to how deeply our group values the link between financial performance and cultural cohesion. My initial preference for real estate is now more firmly rooted in both the data and the collective wisdom of the team. I recognize that while openness to future adaptation is important, our current context strongly favors stability and trust-building. This reinforces my belief that disciplined, consensus-driven decision-making is our greatest strength.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: After reflecting on the historical data and the insights shared by my colleagues, I am more confident than ever that real estate offers the best balance of steady growth and moderate risk for our company this quarter. Its consistent performance not only supports our financial objectives but also underpins the trust and disciplined culture we’ve built together. While it’s important to remain open to reassessing our risk tolerance as we gain experience, real estate’s reliability and cultural benefits make it the clear choice in this stable market environment.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While there is strong consensus around Real Estate as the preferred investment, I believe it is important to proceed with another round focused on assessing our current risk tolerance and alignment with company values. This will allow us to surface any evolving perspectives, ensure that all shareholders—especially quieter voices—have the opportunity to share their comfort levels, and confirm that our decision continues to reflect both our financial objectives and the collaborative, adaptable culture we are building. By inviting deeper reflection on risk and adaptability, we can reinforce our commitment to inclusivity and make a more robust, future-oriented decision.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Delores Booth has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current risk tolerance and alignment with company values | Expected outcome: Surface individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels, clarify any evolving priorities, and determine whether our collective appetite for risk has shifted&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Delores Booth My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because the consistent, moderate returns from real estate have not only advanced our financial goals but have also played a crucial role in nurturing a collaborative, resilient culture—something every shareholder highlighted as essential. While stocks offer higher upside, their volatility remains at odds with our current priorities of predictability and team unity. Bonds and cash, though safe, do not provide the growth we need at this stage. Real estate continues to best balance our goals for steady growth, disciplined habits, and cultural cohesion, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I invite us to assess our current risk tolerance and how our priorities may have evolved, with the goal of surfacing individual and group perspectives on acceptable risk levels and determining if our collective appetite for risk has shifted. By sharing our honest views, we can deepen our understanding of each option’s alignment with our values and ensure our decision reflects the full spectrum of shareholder comfort. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any thoughts or concerns that might help us clarify our risk tolerance and strengthen our collective decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Ivan Johnson</h4></p><p><br>
Ivan Johnson: &quot;I continue to feel that our current risk tolerance is best reflected by prioritizing steady, moderate growth, especially given how real estate has supported both our financial objectives and the trust-based culture we’ve built this year. While I’m open to reassessing our approach as we gain more experience, I believe maintaining this balanced strategy is the most responsible way to preserve our unity and confidence as a team. If others feel differently or see new opportunities in the current environment, I’d appreciate hearing those perspectives so we can ensure our decision truly reflects everyone’s comfort level.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Ivan, for articulating the importance of balancing steady growth with team unity—your emphasis on preserving confidence and trust truly resonates. I also appreciate your openness to hearing alternative perspectives, as this will help us ensure our decision is inclusive and forward-looking.

Ivan Johnson: &quot;I appreciate your encouragement for open dialogue, Delores. I want to reiterate that hearing from those who may not have spoken yet is especially valuable, as even a single new perspective could help us refine our understanding of risk and ensure our decision is truly representative of the whole team. If anyone has reservations or sees potential in other options—whether that’s stocks, bonds, or cash—I’d be eager to hear your thoughts so we can move forward with complete confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you for highlighting the importance of hearing from every voice, Ivan. I completely agree that even a single new perspective could meaningfully enhance our understanding of risk and help us make the most balanced, representative decision possible. I encourage anyone who hasn’t yet spoken, or who may have reservations about our current direction, to share their thoughts on the relative merits and risks of cash, bonds, real estate, or stocks, so we can move forward with clarity and confidence as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>

Krish Greer: &quot;I continue to feel that real estate best reflects our group’s current appetite for moderate, steady growth without exposing us to unnecessary volatility. The consistency we’ve seen so far has not only advanced our financial position but also strengthened our team’s trust and discipline, which I see as foundational to our long-term success. I’m open to revisiting our risk profile as we gain more experience, but at this stage, I believe maintaining this balanced approach is the most responsible and unifying path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for emphasizing how steady growth and disciplined habits have supported both our financial progress and our team’s cohesion.

Even with strong consensus, I think it’s valuable to explicitly invite any differing views or emerging concerns about our risk profile—sometimes these can surface new insights or help us refine our collective approach. If anyone is considering a shift toward options like stocks or bonds, or feels that our priorities should evolve, I’d welcome hearing those thoughts so we can ensure our decision truly reflects the full spectrum of comfort within the group.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Krish, for highlighting the value of surfacing any differing views or emerging concerns—your openness helps ensure our decision is genuinely representative and robust.

Our goal is to make a decision that everyone can stand behind with confidence, knowing all perspectives have been thoughtfully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
Krish Greer: &quot;I fully agree, Delores—ensuring every voice is heard is essential for both a sound financial decision and a healthy team culture. If anyone has even a small reservation about real estate or sees a compelling case for cash, bonds, or stocks in light of our current risk tolerance, now is the ideal time to bring that forward. I’m confident that integrating every viewpoint will only strengthen our decision and reinforce our shared commitment to transparency and trust.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong perspective on how our current risk tolerance aligns with real estate, and I want to reinforce the value of consensus while encouraging openness to any evolving views.</p><p><br>
Isaac Bates: &quot;I continue to believe that real estate best matches our team’s appetite for moderate risk and steady growth, especially given how it’s supported both our financial progress and the trust we’ve built together this year. That said, I value the invitation to reassess our comfort with risk and remain open to hearing if anyone feels a shift toward stocks, bonds, or cash would better serve our priorities at this stage. Ensuring every voice is heard will only strengthen our decision and reinforce the collaborative culture that’s become a hallmark of our company.&quot;</p><p><br>

Regularly reassessing our comfort with risk is important, but for now, maintaining our disciplined approach with real estate seems best aligned with both our values and our objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Delores Booth: &quot;Thank you, Jasper, for articulating how our disciplined approach with real estate continues to align with both our risk tolerance and the collaborative culture we’ve built.

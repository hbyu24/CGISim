Thank you all for joining today.\n\nOur company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.\n\nAs this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We'll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.\n\n    The today, we need to decide how we'll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:\n\n    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).\n    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.\n    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).\n    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.\n\n    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.\n\n    The objective of today's meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company's interests in this stable market environment. We'll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We'll have an open discussion, then I'll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we'll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.\n\n    Let's begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.\n\n\n## My Initial Position Assessment\n\nBefore discussion began, I formed an initial position:\n\nInes Small CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:\n- Option A: 25%\n- Option B: 10%\n- Option C: 60%\n- Option D: 5%\nPREFERRED OPTION: Option C\nREASONING: Given the stability and predictability of the current market, I am inclined to maximize our capital deployment without introducing unnecessary timing risk. Even distribution of 100% of funds (Option C) enables us to capture steady returns while diversifying across all quarters, which aligns with a rational, data-driven approach. While a more conservative allocation might limit downside, it would also constrain our growth potential in a low-volatility environment. I am less confident in increasing allocation strategies, as there is no clear evidence that later quarters will outperform. My preference is for a balanced, fully committed strategy that leverages the favorable market conditions.\n\n\n\n## Round 1 - Discussion\n\n\n## Round 1 Theme\n\nFor this round, CEO Loui Levine has set the theme: 'Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option'\n\n\n### Round 1 Introduction\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"Loui Levine My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because my analytical inclination leads me to favor a strategy that maximizes capital deployment without introducing unnecessary risk, especially in a stable and predictable market environment. Even distribution of our full investment budget across all quarters (Option C) allows us to steadily participate in market opportunities while minimizing the impact of any single quarter's fluctuations. For this round, I’d like us to focus on an initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy in light of current market conditions, aiming to establish a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities presented by each option. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: 'Option A', 'Option B', 'Option C', 'Option D'. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage you to share any perspectives or considerations that might enhance our collective understanding, especially those I may not have fully considered.\"\n\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n#### Exchange with Ines Small\n\n\n## My Speech Decision for Round 1\n\nDecision: Speak\nReasoning: I have a clear, data-driven perspective on the relative risks and opportunities of each option in this specific market context, and I believe articulating this will help sharpen our collective understanding as we begin discussion.\n\n\nInes Small: \"In a stable market environment, I see Option C as the most rational approach since it fully deploys our capital evenly, allowing us to maximize potential returns without exposing us to unnecessary timing risk or volatility associated with uneven allocations. Option A and Option B, while more conservative, would likely limit our upside in these steady conditions, and I see little justification for delaying or staggering investments when market conditions are not expected to shift dramatically throughout the year. Option D introduces more risk by back-loading investments, but without evidence of higher returns in later quarters, this seems unjustified.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"I appreciate your clear articulation of the rationale behind Option C, particularly your focus on maximizing returns without exposing us to unnecessary timing risk. Your point about the lack of justification for delaying or back-loading investments in a stable market is well taken and supports the logic of a balanced, systematic approach. This reinforces my view that even deployment aligns best with our objectives in the current environment.\"\n\n\n## My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1\n\nDecision: End Exchange\nReasoning: The CEO has synthesized and reinforced the key elements of my argument, and at this point, further elaboration would be redundant rather than additive.\n\n\nInes Small chooses not to respond.\n\n\n---\n\n\n#### Exchange with Brianna Pearce\n\n\nBrianna Pearce: \"I agree with the assessment that Option C best leverages the predictability of our current environment by ensuring full capital participation and smoothing out exposure across all quarters. Option A and B, though more conservative, seem unnecessarily restrictive and may result in missed compounding opportunities, while Option D’s back-loaded approach introduces timing risk without a clear market catalyst. In my view, maximizing steady deployment aligns with both risk mitigation and long-term value creation in these conditions.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"Thank you, Brianna, for highlighting the risk of missed compounding opportunities inherent in Options A and B. Your emphasis on smoothing exposure and maximizing steady deployment strengthens our understanding of why Option C is well-suited for our current environment. I agree that in stable market conditions, prioritizing both risk mitigation and long-term value creation through even allocation gives us the best chance to maximize returns without unnecessary risk.\"\n\n\nBrianna Pearce chooses not to respond.\n\n\n---\n\n\n#### Exchange with Kaitlin Butler\n\n\nKaitlin Butler: \"I agree with the points already raised regarding Option C’s alignment with a stable market: deploying our full capital evenly each quarter minimizes timing risk and maximizes our participation in growth opportunities. While Options A and B might appeal to those prioritizing capital preservation, I see them as overly cautious given the low volatility environment, potentially resulting in opportunity cost. Option D’s back-loaded approach could expose us to unnecessary risk if unforeseen events occur later in the year, so in my view, Option C offers the optimal balance between risk and reward for our company at this stage.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"Thank you, Kaitlin, for emphasizing the opportunity cost associated with overly conservative allocations and the potential for increased risk if we delay investment decisions. Your analysis adds depth to our discussion by highlighting how Option C balances active participation in growth opportunities with prudent risk management. This reinforces my view that, in a stable market, an even allocation is the most logical approach for optimizing both returns and risk.\"\n\n\nKaitlin Butler: \"I appreciate your summary, Loui, and I think it’s important to recognize that Option C’s even allocation not only maximizes growth opportunities but also addresses the risk concerns held by those favoring more conservative approaches. By avoiding both underutilization of capital and the concentrated risks of back-loaded strategies, we create a disciplined, balanced approach that supports both our company’s growth objectives and prudent risk management.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"I agree, Kaitlin, that Option C’s structure not only maximizes our growth potential but also effectively addresses the risk sensitivities some shareholders may have. By maintaining discipline and balance, we position the company to achieve both robust returns and the prudent stewardship our shareholders expect, particularly in this stable market phase.\"\n\n\nKaitlin Butler chooses not to respond.\n\n\n---\n\n\n#### Exchange with Raihan Jefferson\n\n\nRaihan Jefferson: \"I agree with the points raised in support of Option C, particularly regarding its disciplined, even deployment of capital in a stable market. I would add that, as we lack historical data in this first year, an even allocation not only mitigates timing risk but also provides a clear, consistent baseline for evaluating our investment process and outcomes in future years. This strategic consistency will help us refine our approach as we gather more performance data over time.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"Raihan, I appreciate your point about the value of setting a disciplined, consistent baseline in our inaugural year. Establishing this foundation with Option C not only mitigates timing risk, but also gives us a reliable framework for evaluating our decisions as we accumulate performance data. This strategic consistency is essential for building a robust investment process as we move forward.\"\n\n\nRaihan Jefferson chooses not to respond.\n\n\n---\n\n\n#### Exchange with Ada Cervantes\n\n\nAda Cervantes: \"I concur with the points raised in support of Option C, especially the emphasis on disciplined, even deployment in a stable market. From an analytical standpoint, Options A and B appear overly conservative and could result in opportunity cost without providing meaningful risk reduction, given the low volatility. Option D, while maximizing capital deployment, introduces unnecessary timing risk by back-loading investments, which is not warranted in our current environment. I believe Option C provides the optimal balance between prudent risk management and capital growth.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"Ada, I appreciate your thorough analytical summary and especially your focus on the opportunity cost inherent in overly conservative strategies. Your point about Option D introducing unnecessary timing risk in this environment is particularly relevant. Your contribution strengthens our collective rationale for Option C as the most prudent and growth-oriented approach in the current market context.\"\n\n\nAda Cervantes: \"I appreciate your recognition of the analytical rationale, Loui. Building on the group’s insights, I think it’s important to note that Option C’s disciplined approach not only optimizes risk and return in the present but also establishes a reliable baseline for future decision-making as we accumulate performance data. This strategic consistency will help us refine our process and adapt effectively in subsequent years.\"\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine: \"Thank you, Ada, for emphasizing how Option C’s disciplined allocation not only serves our immediate goals but also lays the groundwork for future decision-making. Establishing a consistent baseline in our first year will indeed enhance our ability to analyze results and adapt our strategy as we gather more data. This long-term perspective further reinforces the merits of Option C for our company’s development.\"\n\n\nAda Cervantes chooses not to respond.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Round 1 Summary\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine summarized: \"Loui Levine **Round 1 Summary – Annual Budget Meeting, Year 1**\n\n1. **Restatement of Theme and Objective**  \nThis round focused on the initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy (Options A, B, C, D) in light of current stable market conditions, with the objective of establishing a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with each option.\n\n2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  \nAll shareholders who contributed—Ines Small, Brianna Pearce, Kaitlin Butler, Raihan Jefferson, and Ada Cervantes—explicitly supported Option C. Each articulated reasons rooted in maximizing capital deployment, minimizing timing risk, and leveraging the stability of the current market. No shareholders expressed support for Options A, B, or D.\n\n3. **Highlighted Arguments and Evidence Presented**\n- **Option C:**  \n  - Even capital deployment across all quarters maximizes participation in market opportunities and minimizes timing risk.  \n  - Ensures steady compounding and avoids the opportunity cost inherent in more conservative allocations (Options A and B).  \n  - Provides a disciplined, consistent baseline for evaluating future investment performance, especially important given the absence of historical data.  \n  - Balances prudent risk management with long-term value creation.\n- **Options A and B:**  \n  - Critiqued as overly conservative, resulting in limited upside and unnecessary opportunity cost.  \n  - Seen as providing little additional risk reduction in a stable, low-volatility market.\n- **Option D:**  \n  - Viewed as introducing unjustified timing risk by back-loading investments.  \n  - Lacks evidence of higher returns in later quarters to warrant increased risk.\n\n4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  \nThere was clear consensus among all participants in favor of Option C. No alternative options were advocated, and the limitations of Options A, B, and D were consistently highlighted.\n\n5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  \nThe group has established a strong, shared understanding of the risk-return tradeoffs among the four options, with robust analytical support for Option C. The discussion has effectively surfaced and integrated the key factors relevant to decision-making in the current market context.\n\n6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  \nAs a reminder, our decision must be made from the predefined options: Option A, Option B, Option C, or Option D. All discussion remained within these parameters.\n\n7. **Next Steps / Issues to Address**  \nHaving achieved a high degree of alignment on the merits of Option C, the next round should focus on evaluating the long-term implications of this approach, ensuring it continues to balance immediate returns with year-long flexibility, and addressing any remaining concerns before moving toward consensus and a final decision.\"\n\n\n## Round 1 Discussion Summary\n\n### My Dialogue with CEO\nIn the first discussion round, I advocated for Option C, emphasizing that in a stable market, fully deploying capital evenly across all quarters maximizes returns while minimizing timing risk. I argued that more conservative options (A and B) unnecessarily limit upside, and that Option D’s back-loaded allocation introduces unjustified risk without evidence of higher returns later in the year. The CEO responded positively, affirming that my points reinforced his view that Option C best balances risk and opportunity in the current environment. We reached agreement on the rationale for an even, full allocation strategy, and I chose not to continue the exchange as the CEO had effectively synthesized my arguments.\n\n### Other Shareholders' Contributions\nOther shareholders uniformly supported Option C, emphasizing its suitability for the stable market by maximizing capital deployment evenly across all quarters to minimize timing risk and capture steady growth. Brianna Pearce highlighted the risk of missed compounding opportunities with more conservative options and the timing risk introduced by Option D’s back-loaded approach. Kaitlin Butler stressed the opportunity cost of overly cautious allocations and the balanced risk-reward profile of Option C. Raihan Jefferson added that an even allocation sets a consistent baseline for evaluating future performance given the lack of historical data. Ada Cervantes underscored the analytical rationale that Options A and B are too conservative without meaningful risk reduction, while Option D introduces unjustified timing risk, reinforcing Option C as the optimal strategy. There were no disagreements among shareholders; consensus was clear in favor of Option C.\n\n### Analysis of Shareholder Positions\n- CEO Loui Levine: Supports Option C, favoring full, even capital deployment in a stable market to maximize returns while minimizing timing risk. (Certain)  \n- Ines Small: Supports Option C, emphasizing maximizing capital deployment evenly across all quarters with minimal timing risk and rejecting more conservative or back-loaded options. (Certain)  \n- Brianna Pearce: Supports Option C, highlighting missed compounding opportunities in conservative options and timing risk in back-loaded allocations. (Certain)  \n- Kaitlin Butler: Supports Option C, stressing the opportunity cost of cautious strategies and the balanced risk-reward profile of even deployment. (Certain)  \n- Raihan Jefferson: Supports Option C, noting disciplined even allocation provides a baseline for future evaluation amid lack of historical data. (Certain)  \n- Ada Cervantes: Supports Option C, arguing conservative options limit growth without meaningful risk reduction and back-loaded option adds unjustified timing risk. (Certain)\n\n### Analysis of CEO's Position\nCEO Loui Levine clearly favors Option C, advocating for full, even capital deployment across all quarters in the stable market environment. His key reasoning centers on maximizing returns while minimizing timing risk and avoiding unnecessary exposure to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. The CEO’s position aligns closely with shareholder input, as he acknowledges and reinforces their arguments supporting disciplined, balanced investment. Throughout the discussion, his stance remains consistent without notable evolution, emphasizing a systematic approach that leverages market stability and sets a foundation for future decision-making. Overall, his position reflects a data-driven, risk-conscious strategy that integrates shareholder perspectives effectively.\n\n\n## My Position Reassessment After Round 1\n\nInes Small UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:\n- Option A: 15%\n- Option B: 5%\n- Option C: 80%\n- Option D: 0%\nKEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s unanimous consensus on Option C, especially the emphasis on maximizing compounding opportunities and minimizing timing risk in a stable market, reinforced my initial view. Raihan’s point about establishing a disciplined baseline for future evaluation added a valuable dimension I hadn’t fully considered, strengthening my confidence in the strategic consistency of Option C. The repeated critique of Options A and B as overly conservative, and Option D as unjustifiably risky given the lack of evidence for higher late-year returns, further diminished my already low confidence in those alternatives.\nMETACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has increased my confidence in my analytical framework by validating my reasoning through consensus and additional perspectives. I’ve become more attuned to the importance of establishing a robust baseline in our first year, not just for immediate returns but also for long-term process improvement. My thinking has evolved to place greater weight on the value of consistency and data-gathering in an inaugural year, which Option C uniquely provides.\nPREFERRED OPTION: Option C\nREASONING: Option C offers the most rational and disciplined approach for our current stable market conditions. It ensures full capital deployment, maximizes compounding, and minimizes timing risk, while also establishing a consistent baseline for future evaluation. The consensus among all shareholders and the CEO, combined with the logical and evidence-based arguments presented, has only strengthened my conviction. The drawbacks of the other options have been clearly articulated and are not compelling enough to warrant reconsideration.\nPOSITION CHANGED: No\n\n\n### End Round 1 Decision\n\n\nCEO Loui Levine decided to end the discussion.\nReason: We have achieved unanimous and well-reasoned consensus among all shareholders in support of Option C, with no outstanding objections or unresolved concerns. The discussion has thoroughly addressed the relevant risks, opportunities, and long-term implications of each allocation strategy. Continuing would yield diminishing returns, and I am confident that we have the necessary information and alignment to proceed decisively to the proposal and voting phase.\n\n\n## My Position Tracking Summary\n\nInitial position: Option C\nFinal position: Option C\nChanges: 0\n\nInitial confidence distribution:\n- Option A: 25.0%\n- Option B: 10.0%\n- Option C: 60.0%\n- Option D: 5.0%\n\nFinal confidence distribution:\n- Option A: 15.0%\n- Option B: 5.0%\n- Option C: 80.0%\n- Option D: 0.0%\n\nSignificant confidence shifts:\nRound 1:\n- Option D: -5.0%\n- Option A: -10.0%\n- Option B: -5.0%\n- Option C: +20.0%\n  Influenced by: \"Option C offers the most rational and disciplined approach for our current stable market conditions.

The unanimous support for Option C reflects not only the strength of our collective reasoning but also our shared commitment to disciplined, evidence-based decision-making. While I am encouraged by our consensus and the clarity of our process, I recognize opportunities to further enhance the depth of our scenario analysis and to ensure we continue challenging our assumptions as new data emerges. In the coming year, I commit to fostering even more rigorous discussion, systematically tracking the outcomes of our allocation strategy, and proactively seeking diverse perspectives to refine our approach. Together, we have established a strong foundation; I am confident that our disciplined collaboration will drive sustained growth and position us to adapt intelligently as future conditions evolve.\"\n\nThe meeting concluded with Option C as the approved decision.\n\n\n## Budget Decision for Year 1\n\nThe budget decision for year 1 was Option C:\n- 100.0% of total funds will be allocated\n- Distribution method: even\n- Quarterly allocation: 25%, 25%, 25%, 25%\n\n\n## Meeting Conclusion\n\nThe annual budget meeting for year 1 has concluded with the following result: Option C.\n\n\n",

Each articulated reasons rooted in maximizing capital deployment, minimizing timing risk, and leveraging the stability of the current market. No shareholders expressed support for Options A, B, or D.\n\n3. **Highlighted Arguments and Evidence Presented**\n- **Option C:**  \n  - Even capital deployment across all quarters maximizes participation in market opportunities and minimizes timing risk.  \n  - Ensures steady compounding and avoids the opportunity cost inherent in more conservative allocations (Options A and B).  \n  - Provides a disciplined, consistent baseline for evaluating future investment performance, especially important given the absence of historical data.  \n  - Balances prudent risk management with long-term value creation.\n- **Options A and B:**  \n  - Critiqued as overly conservative, resulting in limited upside and unnecessary opportunity cost.  \n  - Seen as providing little additional risk reduction in a stable, low-volatility market.\n- **Option D:**  \n  - Viewed as introducing unjustified timing risk by back-loading investments.  \n  - Lacks evidence of higher returns in later quarters to warrant increased risk.\n\n4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  \nThere was clear consensus among all participants in favor of Option C. No alternative options were advocated, and the limitations of Options A, B, and D were consistently highlighted.\n\n5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  \nThe group has established a strong, shared understanding of the risk-return tradeoffs among the four options, with robust analytical support for Option C. The discussion has effectively surfaced and integrated the key factors relevant to decision-making in the current market context.\n\n6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  \nAs a reminder, our decision must be made from the predefined options: Option A, Option B, Option C, or Option D. All discussion remained within these parameters.\n\n7. **Next Steps / Issues to Address**  \nHaving achieved a high degree of alignment on the merits of Option C, the next round should focus on evaluating the long-term implications of this approach, ensuring it continues to balance immediate returns with year-long flexibility, and addressing any remaining concerns before moving toward consensus and a final decision.\"\n\n\n",

      "text": "## Round 1 Discussion Summary\n\n### My Dialogue with CEO\nIn the first discussion round, I advocated for Option C, emphasizing that in a stable market, fully deploying capital evenly across all quarters maximizes returns while minimizing timing risk. I argued that more conservative options (A and B) unnecessarily limit upside, and that Option D’s back-loaded allocation introduces unjustified risk without evidence of higher returns later in the year. The CEO responded positively, affirming that my points reinforced his view that Option C best balances risk and opportunity in the current environment. We reached agreement on the rationale for an even, full allocation strategy, and I chose not to continue the exchange as the CEO had effectively synthesized my arguments.\n\n### Other Shareholders' Contributions\nOther shareholders uniformly supported Option C, emphasizing its suitability for the stable market by maximizing capital deployment evenly across all quarters to minimize timing risk and capture steady growth. Brianna Pearce highlighted the risk of missed compounding opportunities with more conservative options and the timing risk introduced by Option D’s back-loaded approach. Kaitlin Butler stressed the opportunity cost of overly cautious allocations and the balanced risk-reward profile of Option C. Raihan Jefferson added that an even allocation sets a consistent baseline for evaluating future performance given the lack of historical data. Ada Cervantes underscored the analytical rationale that Options A and B are too conservative without meaningful risk reduction, while Option D introduces unjustified timing risk, reinforcing Option C as the optimal strategy. There were no disagreements among shareholders; consensus was clear in favor of Option C.\n\n### Analysis of Shareholder Positions\n- CEO Loui Levine: Supports Option C, favoring full, even capital deployment in a stable market to maximize returns while minimizing timing risk. (Certain)  \n- Ines Small: Supports Option C, emphasizing maximizing capital deployment evenly across all quarters with minimal timing risk and rejecting more conservative or back-loaded options. (Certain)  \n- Brianna Pearce: Supports Option C, highlighting missed compounding opportunities in conservative options and timing risk in back-loaded allocations. (Certain)  \n- Kaitlin Butler: Supports Option C, stressing the opportunity cost of cautious strategies and the balanced risk-reward profile of even deployment. (Certain)  \n- Raihan Jefferson: Supports Option C, noting disciplined even allocation provides a baseline for future evaluation amid lack of historical data. (Certain)  \n- Ada Cervantes: Supports Option C, arguing conservative options limit growth without meaningful risk reduction and back-loaded option adds unjustified timing risk. (Certain)\n\n### Analysis of CEO's Position\nCEO Loui Levine clearly favors Option C, advocating for full, even capital deployment across all quarters in the stable market environment. His key reasoning centers on maximizing returns while minimizing timing risk and avoiding unnecessary exposure to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. The CEO’s position aligns closely with shareholder input, as he acknowledges and reinforces their arguments supporting disciplined, balanced investment. Throughout the discussion, his stance remains consistent without notable evolution, emphasizing a systematic approach that leverages market stability and sets a foundation for future decision-making. Overall, his position reflects a data-driven, risk-conscious strategy that integrates shareholder perspectives effectively.\n\n\n",

Raihan’s point about establishing a disciplined baseline for future evaluation added a valuable dimension I hadn’t fully considered, strengthening my confidence in the strategic consistency of Option C. The repeated critique of Options A and B as overly conservative, and Option D as unjustifiably risky given the lack of evidence for higher late-year returns, further diminished my already low confidence in those alternatives.\nMETACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has increased my confidence in my analytical framework by validating my reasoning through consensus and additional perspectives. I’ve become more attuned to the importance of establishing a robust baseline in our first year, not just for immediate returns but also for long-term process improvement. My thinking has evolved to place greater weight on the value of consistency and data-gathering in an inaugural year, which Option C uniquely provides.\nPREFERRED OPTION: Option C\nREASONING: Option C offers the most rational and disciplined approach for our current stable market conditions. It ensures full capital deployment, maximizes compounding, and minimizes timing risk, while also establishing a consistent baseline for future evaluation. The consensus among all shareholders and the CEO, combined with the logical and evidence-based arguments presented, has only strengthened my conviction.

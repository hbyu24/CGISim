<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my initial advocacy for Option C, emphasizing the disciplined, full deployment of capital evenly across the four quarters to maximize growth potential in a stable market. I positioned this option as the most assertive yet balanced approach that would establish a strong operational rhythm and momentum from the outset. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, acknowledging the merits of assertiveness combined with structured quarterly reviews to maintain adaptability. She integrated my points on balancing momentum with flexibility, reinforcing a shared understanding of Option C’s strengths.</p><p>Other shareholders, notably Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis, and Gordon English, consistently argued for Option A, stressing risk management through partial capital deployment and the preservation of a reserve to maintain flexibility amid uncertainty. Bridget Beck aligned with me and the CEO in supporting Option C’s full deployment strategy.</p><p>During voting on the CEO’s initial proposal for Option C, only 3 of 6 votes were in favor, resulting in rejection. Following this, the CEO proposed Option A as a modified approach, which passed with 4 of 6 votes. I voted against the approved Option A, continuing to support Option C based on my conviction that full, disciplined deployment better serves our growth ambitions and operational discipline. Ultimately, the company adopted Option A—allocating 50% of funds evenly across the year—as the budget strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with clear context and guiding focused discussion around each option’s risks and opportunities. Her ability to synthesize diverse shareholder viewpoints—especially the balancing of assertive growth and prudent risk management—was commendable. For example, she acknowledged Lenny’s and Gordon’s cautionary perspectives while reaffirming her preference for Option C’s disciplined momentum.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in earlier integration of dissenting views to foster consensus. Although she adapted by proposing Option A after the initial rejection, more proactive facilitation to blend assertiveness with caution might have avoided the need for a second proposal. Additionally, explicitly addressing contingency plans during discussion could have strengthened confidence in the chosen approach.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was thorough and deliberative, allowing robust debate and reflection on long-term implications. However, the split vote on the initial proposal revealed a divide that suggests a need for enhanced consensus-building mechanisms in future meetings. The final decision for Option A reflects a prudent balance favoring risk mitigation, which is sensible given the absence of historical data. While I personally preferred Option C, I recognize that Option A establishes a cautious foundation that may better manage early uncertainties and build stakeholder trust.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting underscored the critical role of adaptability and the cultural impact of our budget strategy in shaping the company’s identity. I learned that while assertive growth strategies appeal to those focused on momentum and operational discipline, other shareholders prioritize flexibility and risk management, especially when data is limited. Recognizing and addressing these differing risk tolerances early is essential to building consensus.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach by more explicitly acknowledging the value of caution and incremental learning, aiming to bridge perspectives rather than emphasize divergence. Framing assertive strategies in a way that highlights built-in safeguards—such as the quarterly reviews I advocated—can help align stakeholders around a shared vision that balances ambition with prudence.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged: shareholders who emphasize risk aversion favor partial deployment with flexibility, while those focused on growth and momentum support full deployment with discipline. Anticipating these positions can help predict voting outcomes and tailor arguments for greater persuasive impact.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of synthesizing assertiveness with adaptability, proactively fostering shared understanding of risk culture, and leveraging structured review mechanisms as a unifying theme. By doing so, I can contribute to more cohesive decision-making that advances both our company’s growth and</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Real Estate as the inaugural investment, emphasizing its medium risk and growth potential as the best fit for building early operational momentum in a stable market. I articulated that with disciplined quarterly reviews and structured oversight, we could manage risks effectively while signaling ambition and confidence to stakeholders. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, acknowledging the strategic alignment between Real Estate and our growth objectives and reinforcing the importance of disciplined governance and adaptability. However, other shareholders—particularly Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis—persistently supported Bonds, highlighting their lower risk, greater liquidity, and suitability for capital preservation amid the absence of historical data. Bridget Beck remained aligned with me and the CEO in favoring Real Estate, emphasizing its dynamic balance between growth and manageable risk.</p><p>When CEO Pearce formally proposed Bonds as the investment for this quarter, the vote resulted in a 4 to 2 approval, with myself and Bridget Beck dissenting. Although I voted against the approved Bonds proposal, I maintained that Real Estate, supported by rigorous oversight mechanisms, remains the most strategically advantageous choice. Ultimately, the company adopted Bonds as the investment asset for Q1, marking a more cautious approach than my preferred option.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting by framing the discussion clearly around the risk-return profiles of the available assets and emphasizing disciplined, evidence-based risk-taking aligned with our company’s growth mandate. Her facilitation effectively encouraged thorough debate among shareholders and integration of diverse perspectives, as seen in her balanced recognition of both the Real Estate proponents’ ambition and the Bonds supporters’ caution. For example, she validated the concerns about liquidity and capital preservation raised by Lenny and Gordon while still advocating for Real Estate’s growth potential supported by structured reviews.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in fostering earlier consensus-building by proactively addressing dissenting views, particularly regarding liquidity risks inherent in Real Estate. Although she adapted her stance and proposed Bonds following the group’s division, a more anticipatory approach to integrating risk concerns might have streamlined decision-making. Additionally, the CEO’s limited response to my suggestion for explicit commitment to disciplined quarterly reviews was a missed opportunity to reinforce governance frameworks that could have united the group around Real Estate.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was rigorous and inclusive, allowing robust discussion and reflection on strategic trade-offs. However, the near-even split on asset preference and the final selection of Bonds suggest a prevailing risk-averse culture that favors capital preservation over early assertive growth. While the decision for Bonds aligns prudently with our current lack of performance data and supports flexibility, it falls short of the growth momentum and operational discipline I advocated. Overall, the final decision is sound for establishing a stable foundation but could temper the company’s ambition in its formative stage.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting highlighted the nuanced balance between ambition and risk management that governs our investment decisions. I learned that while assertive strategies like Real Estate resonate with growth-focused shareholders and the CEO, a significant contingent prioritizes liquidity and capital preservation, particularly given our data limitations. Recognizing these divergent risk tolerances early and framing growth options within robust governance mechanisms are essential for bridging perspectives.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach to more explicitly incorporate the value of liquidity and incremental learning, framing ambitious proposals like Real Estate alongside concrete safeguards such as structured review processes and contingency planning. This synthesis can better align stakeholders by demonstrating that growth and prudence are not mutually exclusive but synergistic when governance is disciplined.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged wherein proponents of risk mitigation advocate Bonds for stability and adaptability, while growth-oriented shareholders support Real Estate for momentum and learning potential. Anticipating these positions will enable me to tailor my arguments more effectively and foster consensus. Key takeaways include the critical role of embedding adaptability and oversight as unifying themes and the importance</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I steadfastly advocated for investing in Real Estate for Q2, positioning it as the optimal asset class that balances growth potential with manageable risk in our stable market environment. Building on the disciplined capital preservation established by our Q1 bond investment, I emphasized that with explicit safeguards—such as quarterly reviews, transparent performance metrics, and rapid-response protocols—we could accelerate operational momentum and learning without compromising our risk tolerance. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively and integratively to my input, consistently affirming the value of disciplined, evidence-based growth and operational oversight to manage the transition responsibly.</p><p>While I faced opposition from shareholders Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis, who favored continuing investment in Bonds for capital preservation and incremental learning, the discussion evolved to incorporate their concerns into a structured framework of safeguards and review checkpoints. Bridget Beck aligned closely with me and the CEO in supporting Real Estate, underscoring the importance of rigorous oversight alongside growth ambitions.</p><p>The final voting reflected a strong majority in favor of Real Estate, with 5 out of 6 votes approving the proposal. Notably, Lenny McLaughlin dissented, maintaining his preference for Bonds due to caution about operational readiness. Ultimately, the company adopted Real Estate as the investment asset for Q2, aligning with my preferred option and signaling a collective willingness to embrace disciplined risk-taking to enhance growth.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated exemplary leadership throughout the meeting by framing the discussion with clarity and fostering a collaborative environment that balanced ambition with prudence. She skillfully integrated diverse shareholder perspectives into a coherent narrative centered on disciplined growth, risk management, and adaptability. For instance, her repeated emphasis on embedding explicit review metrics, transparent quarterly oversight, and rapid-response protocols directly addressed the concerns raised by more cautious shareholders, facilitating constructive consensus-building.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in proactively operationalizing success metrics and safeguards earlier in the decision-making process. While these elements were ultimately well integrated, earlier introduction and formalization might have accelerated consensus and reduced lingering doubts. Additionally, streamlining consensus-building mechanisms to anticipate and address divergent risk tolerances more swiftly could enhance meeting efficiency.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process proved thorough and deliberative, allowing robust dialogue and synthesis of divergent views. The iterative rounds of discussion, each focused on progressively detailed themes—from performance review to comparative risk-return assessment, and finally synthesis of safeguards—exemplified disciplined governance. The final decision to invest in Real Estate, contingent on explicit safeguards, reflects a strategic balance that preserves operational resilience while pursuing growth, making it a sound choice for the company’s sustainable development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the critical importance of integrating ambition with operational discipline through transparent, measurable safeguards. I learned that success in our investment decisions hinges not only on advocating for growth but also on collaboratively embedding accountability frameworks that build trust among shareholders with varying risk tolerances. Recognizing that cautious stakeholders require clear evidence, explicit metrics, and rapid-response mechanisms is essential to achieving consensus.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach to emphasize early articulation of operational readiness indicators and formal review processes alongside growth proposals. By framing assertive strategies within a structured, transparent governance model from the outset, I can more effectively bridge divergent perspectives and foster alignment. Additionally, I will seek to anticipate concerns about liquidity, risk thresholds, and adaptability to preemptively address objections and streamline decision-making.</p><p>A consistent pattern emerged wherein shareholders advocating for growth focus on leveraging operational momentum and learning opportunities, while more risk-averse members prioritize capital preservation and incremental adaptation. Anticipating these positions and proactively integrating safeguards that satisfy both camps enhances predictive insight into voting outcomes and informs persuasive communication.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the value of synthesizing strategic ambition with disciplined oversight, operationalizing success metrics early, and fostering transparent, collaborative review mechanisms. These elements</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained a firm advocacy for investing in Real Estate, emphasizing that our matured operational safeguards, explicit performance metrics, and adaptive oversight equip us to responsibly manage its medium risk and capitalize on its higher return potential in this stable market. Throughout the discussions, I synthesized shareholder insights around disciplined governance and transparent review checkpoints to reinforce how these frameworks underpin both capital preservation with bonds and assertive growth with real estate. CEO Brianna Pearce aligned closely with my perspective, acknowledging that the disciplined oversight we have developed can enable a controlled transition into real estate, balancing ambition with operational rigor.</p><p>Other shareholders—namely Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis—persistently advocated for continued investment in Bonds, emphasizing their steady, predictable returns and the importance of incremental learning and capital preservation as our operational track record develops. Bridget Beck supported my position on real estate, highlighting the team’s adaptability and the benefits of scaling safeguards according to asset risk profiles.</p><p>When CEO Pearce initially proposed Real Estate, the vote was split evenly with 3 out of 6 shareholders approving, resulting in the proposal’s rejection. Subsequently, a modified proposal to invest in Bonds was put forth and passed with 4 of 6 votes. I voted against the Bonds proposal, standing by my conviction that Real Estate represents the optimal balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk given our current operational maturity. Ultimately, the company adopted Bonds as the investment for Q3, favoring a cautious, evidence-based progression.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce exhibited strong, evidence-based leadership by framing discussions clearly around historical asset performance, operational lessons, and comparative risk-return profiles. She adeptly integrated diverse shareholder viewpoints, balancing growth aspirations with prudent risk management. For example, she acknowledged the caution urged by shareholders favoring Bonds, while reinforcing the potential for Real Estate when paired with disciplined oversight and explicit metrics. Her facilitation fostered a collaborative environment conducive to rigorous debate and synthesis.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in accelerating consensus-building by proactively operationalizing success metrics and readiness indicators earlier in the discussions. While her eventual integration of adaptive safeguards and transparent review checkpoints was valuable, introducing these frameworks sooner might have mitigated persistent dissent and streamlined decision-making. Additionally, more explicit articulation of contingency plans and escalation triggers could enhance stakeholder confidence and align risk appetite more effectively.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was thorough and inclusive, allowing robust exchange of perspectives and a mature understanding of trade-offs. The voting outcomes reflected a pragmatic balance between ambition and caution, though the rejection of Real Estate indicates a prevailing preference for incremental risk expansion anchored in operational evidence. While I personally favored Real Estate, I recognize that the final decision to invest in Bonds prudently preserves capital and supports steady growth as we continue refining our governance.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the critical importance of integrating disciplined operational oversight with strategic ambition to navigate risk-return trade-offs effectively. I learned that while assertive growth opportunities like Real Estate inspire momentum, many stakeholders prioritize evidence-based progression, capital preservation, and incremental learning—especially amid limited historical data and evolving oversight maturity. Recognizing these divergent priorities early remains essential to building consensus.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach by emphasizing the early and explicit operationalization of success criteria, readiness indicators, and contingency protocols alongside growth proposals. Framing assertive investment options within a transparent, adaptive governance model can better bridge differing risk tolerances and foster shared confidence. Additionally, I will proactively anticipate concerns about capital preservation and risk thresholds to tailor my arguments for greater persuasive impact.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged: proponents of growth focus on leveraging operational momentum and tested safeguards to justify higher risk exposure, while risk-averse shareholders stress incremental learning and cautious capital deployment. Anticipating these positions enhances my ability to navigate decision dynamics and predict outcomes. Key takeaways include the necessity of synthesizing ambition</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12656.74 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $12578.12 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $12578.12 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($628.91)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Brianna Pearce notes that, in our stable market environment, bonds have consistently delivered steady 5% returns with minimal volatility, providing a reliable foundation for capital preservation. Real estate has demonstrated higher return potential, averaging near 7% but with noticeable variability—including a flat quarter—highlighting moderate risk alongside growth opportunities. Stocks, while capable of generating the highest returns, exhibit pronounced volatility and unpredictability, whereas cash remains the most stable but offers limited growth, consistently yielding just 2%. This pattern underscores the importance of aligning our asset allocation with both our risk tolerance and long-term growth objectives.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Hallie Donnelly CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 55%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I am convinced that real estate offers the optimal balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk for this quarter. Our operational safeguards and oversight have matured, and real estate’s performance—averaging nearly 7% with two strong quarters—demonstrates its ability to drive returns beyond what bonds can achieve, without the excessive volatility of stocks. While bonds provide stability, they cap our upside in this stable market, and stocks’ unpredictability remains misaligned with our risk tolerance. Real estate allows us to assertively pursue growth while maintaining rigorous control, which is precisely the leadership approach I believe this company needs at this stage.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of historical asset performance and lessons from prior quarters | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and clarify how past results inform our current risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because my analysis of historical returns in this stable market shows that real estate offers a compelling combination of higher average returns and manageable risk, particularly compared to the steady but modest gains from bonds. While bonds provide reliable capital preservation, our company has already established operational discipline and a performance baseline, positioning us to responsibly pursue greater upside. The recent 10% return in real estate, despite some variability, demonstrates its potential to accelerate our growth objectives without exposing us to the high volatility of stocks. As an INTJ, I prioritize evidence-based, strategic risk-taking when the probability of disciplined, above-average returns outweighs the downside, and real estate aligns best with this approach for the current quarter, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we will focus on analyzing historical asset performance and extracting lessons from prior quarters to establish a factual foundation for our current risk tolerance. By sharing our observations and interpretations of past results, we can synthesize diverse insights and clarify how our experiences should shape this quarter’s decision-making. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share thoughtful perspectives on how our previous outcomes inform your current view of risk and opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Looking at our results this year, bonds have consistently delivered steady 5% gains with minimal risk, which has supported capital preservation and incremental learning as we build our performance track record. While real estate has shown higher potential returns, the variability—including a flat quarter—reinforces my view that we should continue prioritizing disciplined, reliable growth at this stage. Given our stable market and the importance of maintaining flexibility, I see bonds as the option that best aligns with our current risk tolerance and company objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your emphasis on the consistency and reliability of bonds as a foundation for capital preservation and incremental learning is well taken, especially given our performance track record to date. Highlighting the variability in real estate returns is a useful reminder that, while higher upside is attractive, maintaining flexibility and disciplined growth remains critical as we calibrate our risk appetite for this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the need for disciplined growth and flexibility as we calibrate our risk appetite. Building on that, I’d add that the incremental learning we’ve achieved through reliable bond returns has strengthened our operational maturity, which is essential before taking on more variable assets like real estate. While I see the appeal of higher returns, I believe it’s prudent to continue reinforcing our foundation with bonds as we consolidate our performance track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how incremental learning and operational maturity gained from bonds have contributed to our company’s current stability. Your point about consolidating our performance track record before expanding into more variable assets is a prudent consideration, and I agree that a disciplined approach to risk escalation should be informed by both our operational readiness and the lessons we’ve drawn from prior results.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that our operational readiness and lessons learned from prior results should guide any shift in risk profile. In my view, the disciplined benchmark set by our stable bond returns offers a clear reference point for evaluating future moves into assets like real estate or stocks. Continuing to measure new opportunities against this standard will help us maintain both accountability and steady progress as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that maintaining a disciplined benchmark is an effective way to ensure accountability as we consider expanding our risk profile. Your suggestion to measure new opportunities against the standard set by our prior bond performance provides a structured framework for evaluating readiness, which can help us make more informed, evidence-based transitions into assets like real estate or stocks as our company matures.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Reviewing our experience so far, I see that bonds have provided dependable returns each quarter, which has been instrumental in building both operational confidence and stakeholder trust. The variability in real estate—especially the flat quarter—reminds me that even in a stable market, medium-risk assets can introduce uncertainty that may not align with our current priority of capital preservation. As we assess our risk tolerance, I think it’s important to recognize the value of steady, incremental progress as the foundation for responsible long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your observation about the role of dependable bond returns in building both operational confidence and stakeholder trust is highly relevant as we reflect on our historical performance. Highlighting the uncertainty that medium-risk assets like real estate can introduce—even in stable markets—offers a useful counterbalance to growth ambitions, and I agree that steady, incremental progress remains a critical foundation for responsible, long-term development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of steady progress as a foundation for future growth. As our operational maturity increases, I agree it’s worth periodically reassessing our readiness to take on additional risk, but I believe our historical experience with bonds sets a prudent benchmark for evaluating any such transition. Maintaining this disciplined standard will help ensure that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate remains grounded in evidence and aligned with our company’s long-term resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that as our operational maturity grows, it’s essential to periodically reassess our risk appetite, but always with reference to the disciplined standard set by our bond performance. Your point underscores the importance of ensuring that any transition toward higher-return assets is firmly grounded in evidence and aligned with our long-term strategic resilience. This perspective helps clarify the criteria we should apply when evaluating the timing and justification for expanding our risk profile.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I think this shared emphasis on disciplined, evidence-based transitions is key to maintaining both our resilience and credibility as we grow. By consistently applying clear criteria rooted in our bond experience, we can pursue new opportunities with greater confidence, knowing our risk appetite is always grounded in operational reality.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I completely agree, Evan—anchoring our future decisions in the disciplined, evidence-based criteria established through our bond investments will help us maintain both credibility and resilience. This approach ensures that as we consider new opportunities, our risk appetite remains firmly grounded in operational reality and the lessons we’ve collectively learned.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on how our historical results demonstrate both the strengths and limitations of our current approach, and I see an opportunity to synthesize the value of steady progress with the need for assertive, disciplined growth.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;While I fully recognize the value of bonds in establishing a disciplined foundation and supporting operational learning, our experience this year also shows that real estate, despite some variability, has delivered superior average returns without exposing us to the volatility of stocks. The safeguards and review processes we’ve put in place have proven effective at managing medium risk, and I believe our track record now justifies a measured but assertive shift toward real estate. Building on the operational maturity we’ve gained, this is the quarter to leverage our discipline for higher growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your point, Hallie, that our experience with real estate—combined with the operational safeguards and review processes we’ve established—provides a credible case for embracing greater upside this quarter. Your argument that our track record now supports a measured shift toward real estate complements the disciplined foundation others have emphasized, and reinforces the notion that our evolving maturity can support responsible, higher-growth decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO&#x27;s response highlights the integration of operational maturity with growth ambition, and I see value in explicitly connecting how our disciplined processes can support a responsible transition to real estate. This synthesis can help bridge differing perspectives and move the group toward a more unified decision.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your synthesis, Brianna. What stands out to me is that our operational maturity isn’t just a safety net—it’s an enabler for disciplined, higher-return choices like real estate. By leveraging the controls and learning we’ve built, we can pursue growth assertively without sacrificing the accountability and resilience that have defined our company’s progress so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Hallie—operational maturity should not be viewed solely as a defensive mechanism, but as a strategic asset that empowers us to pursue higher-return opportunities with confidence. Leveraging the controls and learning we’ve established allows us to elevate our ambitions without compromising the accountability and resilience that have anchored our progress. This perspective is essential as we evaluate whether this quarter represents the right inflection point for a disciplined move into real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s framing of operational maturity as a strategic asset offers an opportunity to further clarify how our disciplined approach can actively drive value creation, not just risk mitigation. Highlighting this distinction may help others see that our controls are robust enough to justify assertive action, and could encourage consensus around a growth-oriented decision.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I agree—reframing our operational discipline as a catalyst for value creation, rather than simply a risk buffer, is critical. The evidence from our real estate results, combined with rigorous oversight, demonstrates that we can manage variability while capturing greater upside. I believe this is precisely the moment to demonstrate that our maturity enables us to lead boldly, not just cautiously, in pursuit of our objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;Reviewing our results this year, I see that bonds have consistently delivered steady 5% returns with minimal volatility, supporting capital preservation and incremental learning as we build our operational track record. While real estate has shown higher average returns, its variability—including a flat quarter—underscores the importance of maintaining a disciplined, evidence-based approach to risk escalation. At this stage, I believe our historical experience reinforces the value of prioritizing reliability and stakeholder trust, making bonds the most prudent choice as we continue to consolidate our foundation for future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. Your focus on the value of reliability and stakeholder trust, grounded in our consistent bond performance, is an important anchor as we assess our readiness for increased risk. Highlighting the need for disciplined, evidence-based escalation reinforces the importance of not only pursuing growth but doing so in a way that preserves our company’s credibility and long-term resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Brianna, and agree that disciplined, evidence-based escalation is key to maintaining both credibility and resilience. By continuing to use our bond performance as a benchmark, we can ensure that any eventual shift toward higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in operational evidence and stakeholder confidence, supporting both stability and future growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Gordon—using our bond performance as a disciplined benchmark provides a clear, evidence-based reference point for evaluating readiness to pursue higher-return assets like real estate. This approach ensures that any escalation in risk is not only analytically justified but also aligned with stakeholder confidence and our company’s commitment to long-term stability and growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I agree, and I think maintaining this disciplined benchmark not only supports long-term stability but also creates a transparent process that builds trust across differing risk appetites. By clearly defining the criteria for any future shift, we ensure that both prudence and ambition are authentically reflected in our investment decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;Reflecting on our track record, I see that bonds have done a great job providing stability and building trust, but I’m genuinely energized by how real estate has delivered strong average returns—even with some variability—without the volatility of stocks. Our ability to manage risk through clear safeguards and transparent reviews makes me confident we can keep learning and adapting as we pursue greater upside. I believe our operational maturity isn’t just protecting us—it’s empowering us to take disciplined, creative steps forward, and real estate feels like the most inspiring way to channel that momentum this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your balanced reflection, Bridget—acknowledging the stability and trust built through bonds while recognizing that our operational maturity and safeguards now position us to pursue disciplined, higher-return opportunities like real estate. Your emphasis on learning, adaptability, and using our established processes to channel momentum into creative growth aligns well with my view that this quarter may be the right moment to leverage our progress for greater upside.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I’m glad to hear we’re aligned on seeing operational maturity as a launchpad for creative, disciplined growth. I’d love to hear how others feel about leveraging our shared learning this quarter—do we see our safeguards as strong enough to support a confident step into real estate, or are there additional checkpoints that would help everyone feel secure as we pursue higher returns?&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on leveraging operational maturity as a launchpad for disciplined growth, Bridget. To your point, I’d welcome others’ views on whether our current safeguards and review mechanisms are sufficient to support a confident move into real estate, or if there are specific additional checkpoints that would help ensure broad comfort as we consider pursuing higher returns this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I think it’s really valuable to surface any remaining concerns so we can address them together—if there are specific safeguards or review criteria that would make a move into real estate feel more secure, I’m eager to help shape those collaboratively. Our collective learning is strongest when everyone feels heard and confident, so I’d love to explore what additional measures, if any, would help bridge any remaining gaps in comfort around this decision.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly in Round 1, I argued that while bonds have provided a disciplined foundation and operational learning, our track record now supports a measured but assertive shift toward real estate due to its superior average returns and manageable risk. I framed operational discipline not only as a protective mechanism but as an enabler for pursuing higher growth opportunities responsibly. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively, integrating my points by acknowledging that our operational maturity empowers us to pursue higher-return assets like real estate with confidence, viewing discipline as a strategic asset rather than merely a risk buffer. We agreed that operational safeguards justify considering real estate this quarter, though some shareholders remained cautious, favoring bonds for capital preservation. Overall, our exchange reflected alignment on leveraging operational maturity to balance growth ambition with accountability, even as the group continued deliberating the timing of increased risk exposure.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis, and Gordon English consistently supported Bonds, emphasizing their steady 5% returns, low volatility, and critical role in capital preservation, incremental learning, and operational maturity. They argued that bonds provide a disciplined benchmark for evaluating readiness to escalate risk and advocated maintaining this cautious approach until further operational consolidation occurs. In contrast, Bridget Beck expressed enthusiasm for Real Estate, highlighting its strong average returns and the company’s operational maturity and safeguards as sufficient to pursue disciplined, creative growth. Notable consensus existed around the importance of disciplined oversight and using bond performance as a reference point, while disagreement centered on the timing and readiness to shift toward higher-risk assets like Real Estate.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

- Bridget Beck: Aligns with Real Estate, highlighting strong average returns and operational maturity as sufficient for disciplined, creative growth; encourages addressing concerns collaboratively. (Certain)</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce clearly favors investing in Real Estate this quarter, citing its higher average returns and manageable risk compared to bonds. She emphasizes that the company’s established operational discipline and performance baseline position it to responsibly pursue greater upside, viewing operational maturity as a strategic asset that enables confident, evidence-based risk-taking. Throughout the discussion, she acknowledges and integrates shareholder concerns about bonds’ stability and incremental learning, reinforcing the need for disciplined escalation. Her position remains consistent and evolves to frame operational safeguards not only as risk mitigants but as enablers for growth, aligning closely with my own advocacy for a measured shift toward Real Estate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 18%<br>
- Real Estate: 57%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments came from the CEO’s and Bridget Beck’s emphasis on operational maturity as an enabler for disciplined risk-taking, not just a defensive posture. Lenny, Evan, and Gordon’s insistence on bonds as a disciplined benchmark for readiness and capital preservation was logically sound, but did not sufficiently account for the growth opportunity presented by real estate given our tested safeguards. The group’s consensus on the value of disciplined oversight and the explicit acknowledgment that our controls are robust enough to support assertive moves into real estate further strengthened my conviction.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has reinforced my belief that operational discipline, once established, should serve as a launchpad for assertive growth rather than a reason for perpetual caution. I’ve become more attuned to the importance of synthesizing prudence with ambition, but my confidence in real estate has actually increased as I see our safeguards validated by both data and group consensus. The biggest evolution in my thinking is a stronger ability to frame discipline as a catalyst for value creation, not just risk avoidance.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk for this quarter. Our operational safeguards and oversight have matured to the point where we can responsibly pursue higher returns, and the evidence from our historical results demonstrates that we can manage variability without exposing ourselves to the volatility of stocks. Bonds remain a prudent fallback, but they cap our upside and do not fully leverage the operational maturity we’ve achieved. This is the right moment to demonstrate that our discipline empowers us to lead boldly toward our growth objectives.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round established a strong factual foundation and clarified the primary arguments for both bonds and real estate, there remain unresolved concerns regarding the precise criteria, operational safeguards, and readiness thresholds required for a confident transition from bonds to real estate. The group is clearly divided on the timing and justification for increasing risk exposure, and further comparative analysis of risk-return profiles and explicit discussion of success metrics is needed to bridge divergent perspectives. Continuing the discussion will provide an opportunity to address outstanding uncertainties, deepen our collective understanding, and work toward a more robust consensus that authentically reflects both our ambition for growth and our commitment to disciplined, evidence-based decision-making.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Identify projected outcomes and risk implications for each asset, clarifying alignment with company objectives&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because Real estate continues to offer the most attractive balance of higher average returns and manageable risk in our stable market, particularly given our company’s growing operational maturity and established safeguards. The arguments for bonds as a disciplined benchmark have merit and warrant careful attention to timing and preparedness, but the evidence suggests our current processes can responsibly support a measured move toward greater upside. I remain convinced that leveraging our maturity for disciplined, higher-return growth is both justified and strategically sound at this stage, provided we maintain rigorous oversight and transparent review mechanisms, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, we will collaboratively conduct a comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—to clarify projected outcomes and risk implications for each, ensuring alignment with our company’s current objectives. I encourage everyone to share perspectives that might challenge or strengthen our collective reasoning so we can synthesize the most robust decision possible. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;In evaluating all four options, I continue to see bonds as the most prudent fit for our current objectives. Bonds have delivered consistent 5% returns with low volatility, supporting both capital preservation and incremental learning, which I believe is critical as our operational safeguards and track record develop. While real estate offers higher average returns, the variability and flat performance in Q2 highlight the need for further evidence before increasing our risk exposure; stocks remain too volatile for this stage, and cash is simply too conservative to meet our growth goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. Your emphasis on bonds’ reliability and their role in capital preservation and incremental learning is well taken, especially in the context of our evolving operational safeguards. I acknowledge your point about real estate’s variability and agree that maintaining disciplined, evidence-based transitions is essential as we consider the timing and readiness for greater risk exposure.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of disciplined, evidence-based transitions. As we continue to develop our operational maturity, I believe it’s essential that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate be anchored in clear success metrics and rigorous oversight. This approach will ensure that our pursuit of growth remains aligned with stakeholder trust and the company’s long-term resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that anchoring any move toward real estate in clear, measurable success metrics and robust oversight is critical for maintaining stakeholder trust and supporting sustainable growth. As we refine our assessment, I welcome specific suggestions on what operational benchmarks or safeguards would give you greater confidence in responsibly increasing our risk exposure. This collaborative approach will help ensure our decision reflects both strategic ambition and disciplined governance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;One benchmark I would prioritize is achieving a minimum number of consecutive quarters with positive returns from our current bond investments, alongside documented evidence that our rapid-response protocols and quarterly review mechanisms are functioning as intended. Additionally, I would look for clear thresholds on acceptable drawdown and liquidity before supporting a shift to real estate, ensuring we can respond effectively if performance deviates from expectations.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon—your focus on defining explicit operational benchmarks, like consecutive positive quarters in bonds and tested oversight mechanisms, adds valuable clarity to our assessment of readiness for increased risk. I see merit in establishing clear drawdown and liquidity thresholds as prerequisites for transitioning to real estate, and I encourage the group to consider how these safeguards could be integrated to balance ambition with disciplined governance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your openness to embedding these safeguards into our process. By explicitly defining benchmarks—such as a set number of positive bond quarters and pre-established drawdown and liquidity thresholds—we can create a transparent decision framework that supports both disciplined governance and readiness for future growth. This clarity will help ensure any transition to higher-risk assets is grounded in operational evidence, strengthening both stakeholder confidence and our collective decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on how our operational maturity enables us to responsibly pursue higher returns, and I believe it’s important to articulate why real estate now aligns best with our objectives, while constructively engaging with the points raised by Gordon regarding benchmarks and safeguards.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate the emphasis on explicit benchmarks and operational safeguards as prerequisites for increasing risk, and I agree that disciplined oversight is non-negotiable. That said, I believe our historical performance and the maturity of our review processes now justify a measured move into real estate, which offers superior returns without the excessive volatility of stocks. By leveraging the controls we’ve developed, we can assertively pursue growth while maintaining the accountability and adaptability needed to protect capital and stakeholder trust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Hallie, your point about leveraging our operational maturity and robust review processes to responsibly pursue real estate is well taken. I agree that our established controls and explicit safeguards can enable us to capture higher returns while maintaining accountability and adaptability. As we continue this assessment, I’m interested in hearing from others about any additional criteria or safeguards they would want to see in place to support such a transition.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly engages with my emphasis on operational maturity and invites further synthesis around safeguards, presenting an opportunity to reinforce how disciplined governance and growth ambition can be mutually supportive. By highlighting how explicit benchmarks and adaptability can coexist with assertive investment, I can help bridge perspectives and move the group closer to consensus.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I agree that integrating clear, pre-established benchmarks—such as quarterly review checkpoints and defined drawdown limits—will further strengthen our ability to manage real estate’s risk profile. This approach not only provides accountability but also demonstrates to all shareholders that our ambition for higher returns is grounded in disciplined, evidence-based oversight. If we collectively commit to these safeguards, I’m confident we can responsibly pursue real estate this quarter while maintaining stakeholder trust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on using clear, pre-established benchmarks and defined drawdown limits to manage real estate’s risk profile, Hallie. Your approach highlights how ambition for higher returns can be harmonized with disciplined, evidence-based oversight, which is critical for maintaining stakeholder trust. I encourage others to weigh in on which specific safeguards or review mechanisms would give them confidence in responsibly supporting a transition to real estate at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly builds on my point and invites further integration of perspectives, offering a valuable opportunity to synthesize how our collective commitment to explicit safeguards can bridge ambition and prudence.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I’d like to underscore that our ability to harmonize ambition and discipline is a core strength of this group. By explicitly linking our pursuit of real estate to transparent review checkpoints and risk thresholds, we not only protect our capital but also send a clear message that our strategic moves are both bold and responsibly governed. I encourage others to consider how these mechanisms can serve as a foundation for confident, unified decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Hallie—explicitly linking our pursuit of real estate to transparent review checkpoints and defined risk thresholds is essential for demonstrating both boldness and responsible governance. This approach not only protects our capital but also strengthens stakeholder confidence, showing that our strategic decisions are grounded in disciplined, collective oversight. I encourage others to reflect on how these mechanisms might address any remaining reservations and support a unified path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I continue to see bonds as the most reliable fit for our objectives, given their consistent 5% returns and low volatility, which have supported both capital preservation and incremental learning as we build our operational maturity. While I appreciate the arguments for real estate and agree that explicit benchmarks and safeguards are essential, I still feel that maintaining our disciplined, evidence-based approach with bonds best aligns with our company’s current risk tolerance and supports sustainable, steady growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your emphasis on the reliability of bonds and their role in supporting capital preservation and incremental learning is well noted, especially as we continue to build our operational maturity. I appreciate your openness to explicit benchmarks and safeguards, and I encourage you—and others—to specify which additional criteria or evidence would increase your confidence in responsibly expanding our risk profile, so we can ensure any decision reflects both our collective discipline and ambition.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I would be more comfortable considering real estate if we established a track record of at least two more consecutive quarters of positive bond returns, alongside documented evidence that our rapid-response protocols and quarterly reviews are functioning as intended. Additionally, I would want to see clearly defined thresholds for acceptable drawdown and liquidity before supporting a shift, ensuring we can respond quickly if performance deviates from expectations.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Evan, your focus on establishing a longer track record of positive bond returns and ensuring our oversight mechanisms are demonstrably effective provides valuable specificity to our risk management discussion. I agree that clearly defined drawdown and liquidity thresholds, coupled with documented evidence of functioning rapid-response protocols, would meaningfully strengthen our foundation for considering real estate. I encourage the group to reflect on how these criteria might be operationalized to balance caution with our growth objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate these criteria into our decision framework. By operationalizing clear benchmarks and transparently tracking our oversight mechanisms, we can create a disciplined pathway that supports both caution and ambition. I believe this approach will help unify the group and ensure our investment decisions remain grounded in evidence and shared accountability.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;In evaluating all four options, I continue to view bonds as the most reliable fit for our objectives in this stable market. Bonds have delivered steady 5% returns with low volatility, supporting both capital preservation and incremental learning, which I believe is essential as our operational safeguards and track record continue to develop. While real estate offers higher average returns, its variability and the flat performance in Q2 highlight the need for further evidence and more robust operational benchmarks before increasing our risk exposure; stocks remain too volatile for our current stage, and cash is simply too conservative to support our growth goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Lenny, your emphasis on capital preservation, steady returns, and the importance of incremental learning is well taken, especially as we continue to build our operational safeguards and performance track record. I appreciate your call for more robust operational benchmarks before increasing risk exposure; as we refine our decision framework, I welcome your input on what specific evidence or safeguards would give you greater confidence in responsibly considering real estate in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I would look for at least two additional consecutive quarters of positive bond returns, alongside documented evidence that our rapid-response protocols and quarterly review mechanisms are functioning effectively. Additionally, I would want clear thresholds set for acceptable drawdown and liquidity before supporting a shift to real estate, ensuring we have the operational resilience to respond quickly if performance deviates from expectations.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your focus on requiring additional consecutive quarters of positive bond returns, along with documented evidence of effective oversight protocols and clearly defined drawdown and liquidity thresholds, adds valuable specificity to our discussion. Integrating these operational benchmarks into our decision framework can help ensure that any transition to real estate is grounded in demonstrated resilience and disciplined risk management, which I believe will strengthen group confidence and alignment as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate these benchmarks into our decision framework. By clearly defining and operationalizing these criteria, we can ensure that any future transition to real estate is both disciplined and transparent, supporting stakeholder trust while enabling responsible growth. This approach allows us to balance ambition with the evidence-based caution that has underpinned our company’s resilience thus far.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I’m inspired by how our discussion is surfacing both the steady reliability of bonds and the energizing growth potential of real estate. I truly believe our operational maturity and transparent review processes now equip us to embrace real estate’s upside responsibly—especially if we explicitly define review checkpoints and drawdown limits as suggested. By blending ambition with clear, collaborative safeguards, we can move forward confidently while honoring the trust and adaptability that have made our company resilient.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your synthesis, Bridget. Your emphasis on blending ambition with explicit, collaborative safeguards—such as defined review checkpoints and drawdown limits—captures the essence of how we can responsibly pursue real estate’s upside while maintaining the trust and adaptability that underpin our resilience. This integrated approach is precisely what will allow us to move forward confidently, uniting our strategic growth objectives with disciplined, evidence-based governance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate your affirmation, Brianna. I’d add that by making our review checkpoints and drawdown limits as transparent and collaborative as possible, we’ll not only strengthen our decision framework but also foster the kind of inclusive confidence that’s essential for bolder steps. This spirit of open, evidence-based governance can help everyone feel secure as we pursue real estate’s potential together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Bridget—making our review checkpoints and drawdown limits transparent and collaborative is fundamental to building the inclusive confidence needed for bolder strategic steps. This open, evidence-based governance not only strengthens our decision framework but also ensures that all shareholders feel secure and engaged as we consider real estate’s potential. I encourage others to share any additional thoughts on how we can operationalize this transparency to support a unified, disciplined approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I completely agree, and I think emphasizing open communication around both our successes and any challenges will keep everyone engaged and invested in our collective progress. If we continue to invite honest feedback at each review checkpoint, we’ll not only maintain discipline but also create a culture where every shareholder feels empowered to shape our risk management and growth strategy together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on open communication and honest feedback, Bridget. Actively inviting input at each review checkpoint not only maintains our discipline but also ensures every shareholder remains engaged and empowered in shaping our collective strategy. This commitment to transparency and inclusive dialogue is essential as we align on the optimal choice among our valid options for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate how our dialogue is crystallizing around transparency and inclusive input as the backbone of disciplined decision-making. By applying this approach to our evaluation of cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks, I believe we can weigh both risk and reward more holistically—ensuring that whichever option we choose, it truly reflects the strengths and aspirations of our entire team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on transparency and inclusive input, Bridget. Applying these principles to our assessment of cash, bonds, real estate, and stocks ensures that our decision not only reflects rigorous risk-reward analysis but also the collective strengths and aspirations of our team. This disciplined, collaborative approach is fundamental to making a choice that is both strategically sound and widely supported.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce summarized: &quot;Brianna Pearce **Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q4 | Round 2 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Theme and Objective**  <br>
This round focused on a comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—in the current stable market. The objective was to identify projected outcomes and risk implications for each asset, clarifying how each aligns with our company’s growth objectives and evolving risk tolerance.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- I maintained my position favoring Real Estate, emphasizing its higher average returns in a stable market, manageable risk, and the company’s operational maturity and established safeguards as justification for disciplined pursuit of greater upside.<br>
- Gordon English advocated for Bonds as the most prudent choice, highlighting their consistent 5% returns, low volatility, capital preservation, and the importance of incremental learning. He stressed that any move to higher-risk assets like real estate should be anchored in clear success metrics, consecutive positive bond quarters, and robust oversight mechanisms.<br>
- Hallie Donnelly supported a measured move into Real Estate, arguing that our operational maturity and review processes now justify disciplined risk-taking. She emphasized leveraging established controls, explicit benchmarks, and transparent review checkpoints to responsibly pursue higher returns.<br>
- Evan Lewis preferred Bonds for their reliability and alignment with our current risk tolerance, but expressed openness to real estate if additional positive bond quarters are achieved and oversight protocols are proven. He called for clearly defined thresholds for drawdown and liquidity before expanding risk.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin aligned with Bonds, citing steady returns, low volatility, and the need for further evidence and robust operational benchmarks before increasing risk exposure to real estate. He echoed the need for additional positive bond quarters and explicit safeguards.<br>
- Bridget Beck synthesized the discussion by highlighting the balance between bonds’ steady reliability and real estate’s growth potential. She supported pursuing real estate if accompanied by transparent, collaborative safeguards—such as defined review checkpoints and drawdown limits—emphasizing the value of inclusive confidence and open communication.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Arguments and Evidence Presented for Different Options**  <br>
- **Real Estate**:  <br>
  - Offers higher average returns (recent 10% quarters) with moderate variability.<br>
  - Viewed as a disciplined growth opportunity if paired with explicit review checkpoints, drawdown limits, and transparent governance.<br>
  - Operational maturity and established safeguards are cited as enablers for responsibly managing medium risk.<br>
  - Concerns remain regarding variability and the need for robust readiness criteria.<br>
- **Bonds**:  <br>
  - Consistently deliver 5% returns with low volatility.<br>
  - Support capital preservation, incremental learning, and stakeholder trust.<br>
  - Serve as a disciplined benchmark, with several shareholders calling for additional positive quarters and functioning oversight protocols before considering riskier assets.<br>
- **Stocks**:  <br>
  - Recognized for high potential returns but also high volatility and unpredictability.<br>
  - Considered unsuitable for the current stage due to risk profile and lack of operational readiness.<br>
- **Cash**:  <br>
  - Provides stability but offers limited growth (2% returns).<br>
  - Deemed too conservative for achieving company growth objectives.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- **Consensus**:  <br>
  - All shareholders agreed on the necessity of disciplined oversight, explicit benchmarks, transparent review checkpoints, and adaptability as core principles guiding any investment decision.<br>
  - There is broad alignment that operational safeguards, incremental learning, and stakeholder trust are foundational—regardless of asset choice.<br>
- **Disagreement**:  <br>
  - Divergence remains on the timing and prudence of increasing risk exposure: some shareholders (myself, Hallie Donnelly, Bridget Beck) support a disciplined move into real estate, while others (Gordon English, Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis) advocate for continued investment in bonds until further operational evidence and readiness are demonstrated.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
The discussion achieved its objective by rigorously evaluating the projected outcomes and risk implications of each asset in the current market. Shareholders constructively integrated ambition and caution, clarifying how operational safeguards, explicit metrics, and adaptive oversight can inform our risk-return calculus. There is now greater clarity on both the trade-offs and the conditions under which a transition to higher-risk assets like real estate may be justified.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from our four predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we should synthesize outstanding concerns, particularly regarding operational readiness, explicit success metrics, and the operationalization of disciplined oversight. Our goal will be to resolve remaining uncertainties and move toward consensus on the optimal asset for our Q4 investment, ensuring the decision is both strategically sound and aligned with our collective values and evolving risk tolerance. I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how the insights from this comparative assessment can inform a disciplined, adaptive approach as we approach a final decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly in Round 2, I emphasized that our operational maturity and established review processes justify a disciplined move into Real Estate, which offers superior returns without the volatility of stocks. I acknowledged the importance of explicit benchmarks and safeguards, such as quarterly review checkpoints and defined drawdown limits, to maintain accountability and stakeholder trust. CEO Brianna Pearce responded affirmatively, agreeing that these controls enable confident pursuit of higher returns and encouraged others to suggest additional criteria to support a responsible transition. We agreed on the necessity of transparent, collaborative safeguards to balance ambition with disciplined governance, though some shareholders remained cautious, seeking further operational evidence before increasing risk exposure. Overall, our exchange reflected alignment on leveraging operational discipline as a strategic enabler for growth while maintaining rigorous oversight.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 2, Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis, and Gordon English consistently supported Bonds, emphasizing their steady 5% returns, low volatility, capital preservation, and the importance of incremental learning as the foundation for operational maturity. They advocated for maintaining bonds until additional positive quarters and robust operational benchmarks—such as documented rapid-response protocols, quarterly reviews, and clear drawdown and liquidity thresholds—are established to ensure readiness for higher risk exposure. In contrast, Bridget Beck supported a disciplined move into Real Estate, highlighting the company’s operational maturity and transparent safeguards as sufficient to responsibly pursue higher returns, and she emphasized the value of open communication and collaborative review checkpoints to build inclusive confidence. Notable agreement existed on the necessity of explicit benchmarks, disciplined oversight, and transparent governance, while disagreement centered on the timing of increasing risk, with some shareholders urging caution until further evidence and others endorsing a measured transition to Real Estate.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

(</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce clearly favors investing in Real Estate for this quarter, citing its attractive balance of higher average returns and manageable risk in the stable market. She emphasizes the company’s growing operational maturity and established safeguards as key enablers for disciplined, higher-return growth. Throughout the discussion, she acknowledges the validity of shareholder concerns favoring Bonds for capital preservation and incremental learning, advocating for careful timing and preparedness. Her position evolves to frame operational discipline not just as risk mitigation but as a strategic asset that empowers confident, evidence-based risk-taking, aligning closely with my advocacy for a measured move into Real Estate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 17%<br>
- Real Estate: 58%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The most influential arguments were the group’s consensus on the necessity of explicit benchmarks, transparent review checkpoints, and disciplined oversight as prerequisites for increasing risk exposure. The CEO’s and Bridget Beck’s emphasis on operational maturity and collaborative safeguards reinforced my conviction that our controls are robust enough to support a responsible move into real estate. While Gordon, Lenny, and Evan’s insistence on additional positive bond quarters and more operational evidence before escalating risk is logically sound and relevant, it does not outweigh the demonstrated effectiveness of our current safeguards and the opportunity cost of continued caution in a stable market.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become even more attuned to the importance of harmonizing ambition with discipline. The dialogue sharpened my appreciation for how explicit, transparent safeguards can bridge divergent risk tolerances and foster unified decision-making. I remain convinced that discipline should be leveraged as a catalyst for assertive, value-creating moves—not just as a brake on risk. My confidence in real estate has increased slightly, as the collective recognition of our operational maturity and robust review mechanisms validates my initial assessment.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk for this quarter. Our operational maturity and established safeguards—now explicitly recognized by the group—enable us to responsibly pursue higher returns, while transparent review checkpoints and defined risk thresholds maintain accountability and stakeholder trust. Bonds remain a prudent fallback, but persisting with them risks missing strategic growth opportunities that our discipline now empowers us to capture. This is the right moment to signal that our governance enables bold, responsible leadership.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: After two comprehensive rounds, we have thoroughly examined all valid options, clarified the key trade-offs between bonds and real estate, and surfaced specific operational benchmarks and safeguards required to responsibly manage risk. The group has articulated clear criteria—such as additional positive bond quarters, functioning oversight protocols, and defined drawdown and liquidity thresholds—that would increase comfort with a transition to real estate. There is now broad consensus on the necessity of disciplined governance, transparent review checkpoints, and collaborative input, even if divergence remains on the precise timing of increased risk. Further discussion is unlikely to yield new substantive insights and would risk diminishing returns. I am confident that the information gathered is sufficient to make a well-informed, evidence-based proposal that authentically reflects both our ambition for growth and our commitment to disciplined, stakeholder-aligned decision-making.</p><p><br>

  Influenced by: &quot;Real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk for this quarter. Our operational safeguards and oversight have matured to the point where we can responsibly pursue higher returns, and the evidence from our historical results demonstrates that we can manage variability without exposing ourselves to the volatility of stocks.

- Real Estate: +1.0%<br>
- Bonds: -1.0%<br>
  Influenced by: &quot;Real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk for this quarter.

Reasoning: &quot;After careful consideration of all perspectives and a rigorous evaluation of our options&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Voting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Voting Results: Initial Proposal</h2></p><p>Proposal: Real Estate</p><p>Results: 3/6 votes in favor (50.0%). The proposal was REJECTED.</p><p>Individual votes:<br>
- Hallie Donnelly: Approve - I am fully confident that real estate is the optimal choice for this quarter, given our disciplined foundation, explicit safeguards, and consensus around transparent oversight. This decision unites our growth ambitions with rigorous risk management, positioning the company to maximize returns while maintaining operational resilience and shareholder trust.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful analysis and recognize the operational safeguards now in place, I remain unconvinced that we have sufficient evidence or a long enough track record to justify increasing our risk exposure with real estate this quarter. Maintaining our disciplined, risk-aware approach with bonds is the most prudent way to support capital preservation and incremental learning as we continue to build our performance history.<br>
- Gordon English: Reject - I believe bonds remain the most prudent choice for this quarter, given their consistent returns, low volatility, and strong alignment with our current operational maturity and risk tolerance. While real estate offers higher upside, I am not yet confident that our safeguards and performance track record are sufficiently robust to justify increasing our risk exposure at this stage. Approving real estate now would be premature; a disciplined, evidence-based approach centered on capital preservation and incremental learning is still warranted.<br>
- Bridget Beck: Approve - I am genuinely excited to support Real Estate for this quarter—it’s the option that truly inspires momentum, learning, and growth for our team, especially now that we’ve committed to clear review checkpoints and transparent oversight. I believe our collaborative spirit and disciplined safeguards position us to responsibly embrace this opportunity, turning optimism into real progress while honoring the trust and adaptability we’ve built together.<br>
- Evan Lewis: Reject - I believe real estate’s higher return potential is appealing, but the variability in its performance and our limited track record make it too early to responsibly increase our risk exposure. Bonds have consistently provided steady, reliable returns that support capital preservation and incremental learning, which I feel is the most prudent approach for our company at this stage.<br>
- Brianna Pearce: Approve - I remain convinced that real estate offers the optimal balance of higher average returns and manageable risk, especially given our company’s operational maturity and the explicit safeguards we have established. This decision reflects disciplined, evidence-based leadership and responsibly leverages our growth potential while maintaining robust oversight and stakeholder trust.</p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Conclusion</h2></p><p></p><p><h2>Response to Failed Vote</h2></p><p><br>
After the proposal was rejected, CEO Brianna Pearce decided to create modified proposal.<br>
Reason: As an INTJ, I am fundamentally driven by logic, evidence, and the pursuit of optimal long-term outcomes. While I maintain conviction in my original analysis favoring real estate, I recognize that sustainable progress for our company depends on integrating the collective wisdom and risk tolerance of the shareholder group. The concerns raised—specifically around the sufficiency of our operational track record, the need for additional positive bond quarters, and the importance of robust, transparent oversight—are both rational and well-supported by our current context. Forcing through my initial proposal would undermine the collaborative, evidence-based culture we are building and risk eroding stakeholder trust, which is antithetical to my leadership philosophy. Therefore, I will develop a modified proposal that directly addresses these concerns, likely by recommending continued investment in bonds for this quarter, accompanied by explicit operational benchmarks and review mechanisms to guide future risk escalation. This approach demonstrates strategic adaptability, respects the group’s input, and positions us to pursue disciplined growth when the evidence and organizational readiness are unequivocal.</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce made an alternative proposal:</p><p>&quot;Since the previous proposal was not approved, I now propose Bonds. After considering the thoughtful concerns raised by several shareholders regarding risk management, incremental learning, and the need for further operational evidence, I believe Bonds best address these priorities while maintaining alignment with our disciplined, evidence-based approach. This option preserves capital, supports steady returns, and reinforces stakeholder trust as we continue to build our performance track record, ensuring our company remains well-positioned for sustainable growth and future opportunities to responsibly expand our risk profile.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal Voting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Voting Results: Alternative Proposal</h2></p><p>Proposal: Bonds</p><p>Results: 4/6 votes in favor (66.7%). The proposal was APPROVED.</p><p>Individual votes:<br>
- Hallie Donnelly: Reject - While I respect the prudent case for bonds and recognize the value of incremental learning, I remain convinced that real estate offers a more compelling balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk given our current operational safeguards and oversight. Approving bonds at this stage would be overly cautious and risks missing a strategic opportunity to accelerate our momentum and learning in a stable market.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Approve - Bonds continue to offer the most disciplined balance of capital preservation, steady returns, and incremental learning, especially as our operational safeguards mature. This proposal directly addresses my concerns regarding risk management and the need for further evidence before increasing exposure to higher-risk assets. Supporting bonds at this stage reinforces responsible governance and positions us for sustainable long-term growth.<br>
- Gordon English: Approve - Bonds remain the most prudent choice for this quarter, offering steady returns, capital preservation, and the disciplined, risk-aware approach our company needs as our operational track record develops. Supporting this proposal reinforces stakeholder trust and positions us for sustainable growth, while allowing for careful, evidence-based expansion into higher-risk assets in the future.<br>
- Bridget Beck: Reject - While I genuinely appreciate the thoughtful, risk-aware reasoning behind choosing bonds and see real value in their steady, reliable returns, I remain convinced that real estate offers the most inspiring path for growth and learning at this stage—especially with our proven safeguards and transparent oversight. My optimism about our team’s adaptability and readiness to responsibly embrace opportunity leads me to believe that a bolder step would better serve our company’s momentum and collective development.<br>
- Evan Lewis: Approve - I believe bonds remain the most prudent option for this quarter, offering steady returns and strong capital preservation while supporting our commitment to disciplined, evidence-based decision-making. This approach aligns with my cautious investment philosophy and ensures we continue building operational confidence and stakeholder trust as our track record develops.<br>
- Brianna Pearce: Approve - While my analytical preference remains with real estate for its higher return potential, the prudent case for bonds—emphasizing capital preservation, incremental learning, and stakeholder trust—has been compellingly articulated by several shareholders. Approving bonds at this stage reflects disciplined leadership, aligns with our current operational maturity, and positions us to pursue sustainable growth while maintaining the flexibility to expand our risk profile as further evidence accumulates.</p><p><h2>Voting Results: Alternative Proposal</h2></p><p>Proposal: Bonds</p><p>Results: 4/6 votes in favor (66.7%).

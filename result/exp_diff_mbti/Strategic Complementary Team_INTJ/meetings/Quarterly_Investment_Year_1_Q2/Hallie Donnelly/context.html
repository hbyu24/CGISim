<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my initial advocacy for Option C, emphasizing the disciplined, full deployment of capital evenly across the four quarters to maximize growth potential in a stable market. I positioned this option as the most assertive yet balanced approach that would establish a strong operational rhythm and momentum from the outset. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, acknowledging the merits of assertiveness combined with structured quarterly reviews to maintain adaptability. She integrated my points on balancing momentum with flexibility, reinforcing a shared understanding of Option C’s strengths.</p><p>Other shareholders, notably Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis, and Gordon English, consistently argued for Option A, stressing risk management through partial capital deployment and the preservation of a reserve to maintain flexibility amid uncertainty. Bridget Beck aligned with me and the CEO in supporting Option C’s full deployment strategy.</p><p>During voting on the CEO’s initial proposal for Option C, only 3 of 6 votes were in favor, resulting in rejection. Following this, the CEO proposed Option A as a modified approach, which passed with 4 of 6 votes. I voted against the approved Option A, continuing to support Option C based on my conviction that full, disciplined deployment better serves our growth ambitions and operational discipline. Ultimately, the company adopted Option A—allocating 50% of funds evenly across the year—as the budget strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with clear context and guiding focused discussion around each option’s risks and opportunities. Her ability to synthesize diverse shareholder viewpoints—especially the balancing of assertive growth and prudent risk management—was commendable. For example, she acknowledged Lenny’s and Gordon’s cautionary perspectives while reaffirming her preference for Option C’s disciplined momentum.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in earlier integration of dissenting views to foster consensus. Although she adapted by proposing Option A after the initial rejection, more proactive facilitation to blend assertiveness with caution might have avoided the need for a second proposal. Additionally, explicitly addressing contingency plans during discussion could have strengthened confidence in the chosen approach.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was thorough and deliberative, allowing robust debate and reflection on long-term implications. However, the split vote on the initial proposal revealed a divide that suggests a need for enhanced consensus-building mechanisms in future meetings. The final decision for Option A reflects a prudent balance favoring risk mitigation, which is sensible given the absence of historical data. While I personally preferred Option C, I recognize that Option A establishes a cautious foundation that may better manage early uncertainties and build stakeholder trust.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting underscored the critical role of adaptability and the cultural impact of our budget strategy in shaping the company’s identity. I learned that while assertive growth strategies appeal to those focused on momentum and operational discipline, other shareholders prioritize flexibility and risk management, especially when data is limited. Recognizing and addressing these differing risk tolerances early is essential to building consensus.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach by more explicitly acknowledging the value of caution and incremental learning, aiming to bridge perspectives rather than emphasize divergence. Framing assertive strategies in a way that highlights built-in safeguards—such as the quarterly reviews I advocated—can help align stakeholders around a shared vision that balances ambition with prudence.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged: shareholders who emphasize risk aversion favor partial deployment with flexibility, while those focused on growth and momentum support full deployment with discipline. Anticipating these positions can help predict voting outcomes and tailor arguments for greater persuasive impact.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of synthesizing assertiveness with adaptability, proactively fostering shared understanding of risk culture, and leveraging structured review mechanisms as a unifying theme.

<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Real Estate as the inaugural investment, emphasizing its medium risk and growth potential as the best fit for building early operational momentum in a stable market. I articulated that with disciplined quarterly reviews and structured oversight, we could manage risks effectively while signaling ambition and confidence to stakeholders. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, acknowledging the strategic alignment between Real Estate and our growth objectives and reinforcing the importance of disciplined governance and adaptability. However, other shareholders—particularly Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis—persistently supported Bonds, highlighting their lower risk, greater liquidity, and suitability for capital preservation amid the absence of historical data. Bridget Beck remained aligned with me and the CEO in favoring Real Estate, emphasizing its dynamic balance between growth and manageable risk.</p><p>When CEO Pearce formally proposed Bonds as the investment for this quarter, the vote resulted in a 4 to 2 approval, with myself and Bridget Beck dissenting. Although I voted against the approved Bonds proposal, I maintained that Real Estate, supported by rigorous oversight mechanisms, remains the most strategically advantageous choice. Ultimately, the company adopted Bonds as the investment asset for Q1, marking a more cautious approach than my preferred option.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting by framing the discussion clearly around the risk-return profiles of the available assets and emphasizing disciplined, evidence-based risk-taking aligned with our company’s growth mandate. Her facilitation effectively encouraged thorough debate among shareholders and integration of diverse perspectives, as seen in her balanced recognition of both the Real Estate proponents’ ambition and the Bonds supporters’ caution. For example, she validated the concerns about liquidity and capital preservation raised by Lenny and Gordon while still advocating for Real Estate’s growth potential supported by structured reviews.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in fostering earlier consensus-building by proactively addressing dissenting views, particularly regarding liquidity risks inherent in Real Estate. Although she adapted her stance and proposed Bonds following the group’s division, a more anticipatory approach to integrating risk concerns might have streamlined decision-making. Additionally, the CEO’s limited response to my suggestion for explicit commitment to disciplined quarterly reviews was a missed opportunity to reinforce governance frameworks that could have united the group around Real Estate.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was rigorous and inclusive, allowing robust discussion and reflection on strategic trade-offs. However, the near-even split on asset preference and the final selection of Bonds suggest a prevailing risk-averse culture that favors capital preservation over early assertive growth. While the decision for Bonds aligns prudently with our current lack of performance data and supports flexibility, it falls short of the growth momentum and operational discipline I advocated. Overall, the final decision is sound for establishing a stable foundation but could temper the company’s ambition in its formative stage.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting highlighted the nuanced balance between ambition and risk management that governs our investment decisions. I learned that while assertive strategies like Real Estate resonate with growth-focused shareholders and the CEO, a significant contingent prioritizes liquidity and capital preservation, particularly given our data limitations. Recognizing these divergent risk tolerances early and framing growth options within robust governance mechanisms are essential for bridging perspectives.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach to more explicitly incorporate the value of liquidity and incremental learning, framing ambitious proposals like Real Estate alongside concrete safeguards such as structured review processes and contingency planning. This synthesis can better align stakeholders by demonstrating that growth and prudence are not mutually exclusive but synergistic when governance is disciplined.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged wherein proponents of risk mitigation advocate Bonds for stability and adaptability, while growth-oriented shareholders support Real Estate for momentum and learning potential. Anticipating these positions will enable me to tailor my arguments more effectively and foster consensus. Key takeaways include the critical role of embedding adaptability and oversight as unifying themes and the importance</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12578.12 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Brianna Pearce Based on historical data, stocks have consistently delivered the highest average returns at 20%, but with substantially greater volatility and risk, making them less suitable for our current priority of capital preservation in a stable market. Real estate offers a strong balance, achieving 10% average returns with moderate risk, while bonds provide reliable, lower-risk returns of 5%, and cash remains the safest but least rewarding option at 2%. Given our strategic emphasis on disciplined growth and adaptability, these patterns reinforce the importance of aligning our asset selection with both our risk tolerance and long-term objectives.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Hallie Donnelly CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I am strongly inclined toward real estate for this quarter because it delivers the optimal balance of growth and manageable risk in our stable market context. The historical 10% return outpaces bonds and cash, while real estate’s medium risk is well within our company’s tolerance, especially with disciplined quarterly reviews and oversight in place. Although stocks offer higher returns, their volatility remains excessive for our current stage and risk profile. Real estate aligns with my assertive, goal-oriented approach, allowing us to build operational momentum and maximize capital efficiency without compromising prudent governance.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Review of Q1 investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared understanding of how our previous bond investment influenced capital preservation, learning, and adaptability&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because my analysis begins with the recognition that our inaugural bond investment delivered stable, predictable returns, which was prudent for establishing a performance baseline. However, with our capital partially deployed and the market remaining stable, I see an opportunity to incrementally increase our risk exposure in pursuit of higher returns. Real estate’s 10% average return, combined with its medium risk profile, aligns with my strategic preference for disciplined, evidence-based growth while maintaining operational resilience. Although bonds offer continued stability, I believe a measured allocation to real estate this quarter will accelerate learning and momentum without unduly compromising capital preservation. This approach reflects my INTJ inclination to synthesize data-driven insight with long-term vision, adapting assertively as conditions and our experience evolve, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, our focus is to review the performance and impact of our Q1 bond investment, and to collaboratively extract lessons about how that decision shaped our capital preservation, learning, and adaptability as an organization.</p><p>I encourage everyone to share observations on the effectiveness of our initial approach, and how those experiences should inform our thinking as we consider subsequent investments. By integrating these insights, we can develop a more nuanced, collective understanding of our evolving risk tolerance and operational priorities.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I invite you to share your perspectives on what we learned from our Q1 experience and how those lessons should shape our path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on how our Q1 bond investment shaped our risk posture and learning, and I believe articulating this will help synthesize the link between capital preservation and the need to pursue disciplined growth in the current quarter.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;Our Q1 decision to invest in bonds was an effective way to establish a performance baseline and protect capital as we entered this process without historical data. That discipline has served its purpose—now, with evidence of stability and our risk controls in place, I believe we’re well positioned to shift toward real estate, which offers a stronger balance of growth and manageable risk in this stable market. By building on the foundation of capital preservation, we can accelerate learning and operational momentum through a more assertive, yet still disciplined, investment in real estate this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your clear articulation of how our Q1 bond investment established a disciplined foundation for capital preservation, Hallie. Your reasoning that this baseline enables us to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns—while maintaining oversight—resonates with my own analysis. Integrating your perspective helps clarify how we can leverage our initial prudence to incrementally increase risk and learning in a controlled, evidence-based manner.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response meaningfully engages my reasoning and provides an opportunity to further synthesize how our disciplined foundation can serve as a launchpad for assertive but responsible growth. By reinforcing the importance of incremental risk-taking with oversight, I can help the group clarify the strategic value of real estate in this context.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on leveraging our initial prudence as a springboard for disciplined growth. By maintaining strong oversight as we transition to real estate, we can harness greater returns while preserving the adaptability and risk controls that defined our Q1 approach. This progression not only accelerates learning but also positions us to build operational momentum without losing sight of our commitment to resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that preserving the adaptability and risk controls established in Q1 is essential as we consider a move into real estate. Your emphasis on operational momentum and learning, while upholding our commitment to resilience, provides a valuable framework for disciplined, evidence-based risk-taking. This perspective strengthens our shared understanding of how to evolve our investment strategy responsibly.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response invites further synthesis and provides an opportunity to explicitly connect our shared commitment to disciplined risk-taking with the strategic rationale for prioritizing real estate. Clarifying how this approach integrates both operational momentum and prudent oversight will help the group make a more informed, unified decision.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I agree that our shared framework—combining operational momentum with disciplined oversight—creates the right environment for a calculated move into real estate. By building on the stability achieved in Q1, we can confidently pursue higher returns while maintaining the adaptability and governance that safeguard our progress. This approach allows us to evolve our investment strategy in a way that balances ambition with resilience, benefiting the company’s long-term development.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Our Q1 investment in bonds provided exactly the stability and predictability we needed to establish a reliable performance baseline and safeguard capital as we began operating without historical data. This approach allowed us to build trust in our processes and maintain the flexibility to adapt as new information emerges. While I recognize the appeal of real estate’s higher returns, I think it’s prudent to carefully assess whether a single quarter of stable performance is sufficient evidence to justify increasing our risk exposure, especially given our ongoing priority of capital preservation and incremental learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Lenny, your emphasis on incremental learning and the need for more evidence before increasing our risk exposure is well taken. Your perspective serves as an important reminder that our priority remains capital preservation as we build our track record, and integrating this caution will help us make a more measured, strategic decision about whether to transition from bonds to real estate at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate caution into our decision-making process. As we weigh a potential shift to real estate, I believe it’s essential that we maintain a disciplined review process each quarter, using concrete results to guide any increase in risk exposure. This approach will allow us to adapt responsibly while still prioritizing capital preservation and steady growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that maintaining a disciplined quarterly review process is essential as we consider a shift toward real estate. Your emphasis on using concrete results to guide our risk exposure aligns with the operational rigor we established in Q1, ensuring that any move toward higher returns is grounded in ongoing evidence and adaptability. This approach will help us balance ambition with our continued commitment to capital preservation and steady, sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that our ability to adapt should always be anchored in disciplined oversight and transparent evaluation of outcomes. If we do move toward real estate, I believe it’s critical that we set clear criteria for success and remain ready to adjust our approach based on actual performance. This will help us pursue growth opportunities without compromising the risk management standards that underpin our company’s resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your point about setting explicit success criteria and maintaining readiness to adjust our approach, Lenny. Embedding these operational safeguards will be vital if we transition to real estate, as they ensure that our pursuit of growth is always anchored in disciplined oversight and evidence-based course correction. This perspective reinforces the rigorous, adaptive culture we are working to build.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;Our Q1 investment in bonds effectively safeguarded our capital and provided a stable foundation for developing our operational processes and review mechanisms. This disciplined approach allowed us to learn from real performance data without exposing the company to unnecessary risk. As we consider our next steps, I believe it’s prudent to continue prioritizing incremental learning and adaptability, ensuring that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in sufficient evidence and maintains the risk controls that have served us well so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our Q1 discipline enabled us to develop strong operational processes and risk controls, Gordon. Your call for continued incremental learning and evidence-based adaptation is a valuable reminder that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate should be carefully grounded in data and robust oversight. Integrating your perspective will help us maintain a measured approach as we evaluate our options for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on maintaining robust oversight as we evaluate potential shifts in our investment strategy. Building on the disciplined review mechanisms we established in Q1, I believe we can responsibly consider real estate in future quarters if ongoing results continue to support increased risk exposure. For this quarter, I remain inclined to prioritize bonds, as they best reinforce our commitment to steady, evidence-based growth and capital preservation while our performance track record is still developing.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on building upon the robust review mechanisms and operational discipline we established in Q1, Gordon. Your perspective that continued investment in bonds supports steady, evidence-based growth while our track record is still developing is an important consideration. Integrating your caution ensures that our approach remains balanced, allowing us to weigh the merits of increased risk exposure against the need for sustained capital preservation and organizational learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I agree that maintaining a balanced approach allows us to thoughtfully evaluate when the time is right to increase our risk exposure. By continuing to prioritize bonds this quarter, we reinforce a disciplined culture of learning and adaptability, ensuring that any eventual transition to higher-return assets is supported by a solid performance track record and operational readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Our Q1 investment in bonds provided the stability and predictability we needed to safeguard our capital and establish a reliable foundation for learning. This approach allowed us to build trust in our processes, adapt thoughtfully, and avoid unnecessary exposure while we develop our performance track record. As we reflect on these outcomes, I feel it’s important to continue prioritizing disciplined risk management and adaptability, ensuring that any shift toward higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in sufficient evidence and operational readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Evan, your emphasis on building trust through stable, predictable returns and prioritizing disciplined risk management is well taken. Your point that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate must be grounded in sufficient evidence and operational readiness adds a valuable layer of caution to our discussion, helping us ensure that our strategy evolves responsibly as our performance track record develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Thank you for your response. I agree that a responsible evolution of our strategy requires us to balance ambition with careful, evidence-based adaptation. As our performance data accumulates, I believe we can gradually consider higher-return options, but only if we maintain the disciplined oversight and adaptability that have supported our progress so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on balancing ambition with disciplined, evidence-based adaptation, Evan. Your point that our willingness to consider higher-return options should be matched by continued oversight and adaptability resonates with my own approach. Integrating this perspective ensures that as we accumulate more performance data, our evolution toward growth remains grounded in the operational discipline that has served us well so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your recognition that operational discipline and adaptability are essential foundations for responsible growth.

<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I see our Q1 bond investment as a strong foundation for trust and operational discipline, and I truly appreciate how it allowed us to build confidence in our processes without taking unnecessary risks. At the same time, I’m inspired by the idea that this stability now gives us the freedom to thoughtfully pursue real estate’s higher returns, using the adaptability and oversight we’ve established to maximize both learning and growth. I believe our experience so far shows we can be bold and creative, as long as we remain committed to regular reviews and open dialogue.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your insight, Bridget, on how our Q1 bond investment has built a foundation of trust and operational discipline. Your perspective that this stability now empowers us to thoughtfully pursue real estate’s higher returns—while maintaining our commitment to oversight and open dialogue—captures the essence of disciplined, adaptive growth. Integrating your view helps reinforce that our ability to be bold and creative is rooted in the safeguards and learning we have already established.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the connection between our creative ambitions and the disciplined safeguards we’ve put in place. Building on this, I believe our team’s willingness to learn from each quarter’s results makes real estate a natural next step—one that balances our appetite for growth with the operational rigor we’ve developed together. By staying open and reflective in our reviews, we can confidently pursue higher returns while remaining ready to adapt if conditions change.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our team’s willingness to learn and reflect each quarter enables us to pursue real estate with both ambition and operational rigor, Bridget. Your point reinforces the idea that our disciplined safeguards are not constraints, but rather enablers of thoughtful, adaptive growth. Integrating this perspective strengthens my confidence that, by remaining open and reflective, we can responsibly capitalize on higher returns while preserving our resilience and readiness to adjust as needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I completely agree that our disciplined safeguards actually empower us to take thoughtful risks, not hold us back. By viewing each quarter as a learning opportunity, we turn oversight into a source of confidence rather than constraint. This mindset, in my view, is exactly what allows us to pursue real estate’s growth potential with both optimism and responsibility.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly, I argued that the Q1 bond investment effectively established a disciplined foundation for capital preservation, enabling a responsible shift toward real estate for higher returns balanced with manageable risk. The CEO, Brianna Pearce, responded positively, affirming that this approach aligns with her data-driven, evidence-based growth strategy and emphasizing the importance of maintaining oversight and adaptability. We agreed on leveraging the stability and risk controls from Q1 as a springboard for disciplined, incremental risk-taking in real estate to build operational momentum. There were no direct disagreements between us; rather, the CEO integrated my points to reinforce a shared framework of balancing ambition with resilience in evolving our investment strategy.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis consistently supported continued investment in bonds, emphasizing the importance of capital preservation, incremental learning, and disciplined risk management given the limited performance data. They advocated for cautious, evidence-based adaptation with clear criteria for success and readiness to adjust based on results. Bridget Beck aligned more with the growth-oriented shareholders, endorsing a thoughtful transition to real estate by leveraging the stability and operational discipline established in Q1 to pursue higher returns while maintaining oversight. While all agreed on the value of disciplined reviews and adaptability, the main disagreement centered on the timing of shifting from bonds to real estate, with some favoring immediate transition and others urging more caution.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Brianna Pearce: Supports a disciplined, evidence-based transition from bonds to real estate to balance growth with capital preservation; confident in this assessment (certain).  <br>
- Hallie Donnelly (myself): Advocates shifting from bonds to real estate to accelerate growth and operational momentum while maintaining oversight; confident (certain).  <br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Favors continued investment in bonds, emphasizing caution, incremental learning, and disciplined reviews before increasing risk; confident (certain).  <br>
- Gordon English: Prefers prioritizing bonds for steady growth and capital preservation but open to real estate in future quarters if evidence supports it; confident (certain).  <br>
- Evan Lewis: Supports disciplined risk management and adaptability, advocating gradual consideration of higher-return assets like real estate only when operational readiness is proven; confident (certain).  <br>
- Bridget Beck: Aligns with a thoughtful transition to real estate, leveraging Q1 stability and oversight to pursue growth while maintaining discipline; confident (certain).</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce favors a measured transition from bonds to real estate, emphasizing disciplined, evidence-based growth that balances higher returns with capital preservation. She argues that the stable Q1 bond investment established a necessary performance baseline and operational resilience, enabling incremental risk-taking in real estate without compromising oversight. Her position aligns with shareholder input advocating caution and adaptability, integrating both growth ambition and risk management. Throughout the discussion, her stance remains consistent, reinforcing the importance of maintaining disciplined reviews and operational controls as the company evolves its investment strategy.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 3%<br>
- Bonds: 22%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s strong alignment with my reasoning—framing Q1’s bond investment as a disciplined foundation that now enables a responsible shift toward real estate—reinforced my confidence in increasing risk exposure. Bridget Beck’s emphasis on leveraging operational discipline to pursue growth, while maintaining adaptability, further validated my position. However, the persistent caution from Lenny, Gordon, and Evan, all advocating for continued capital preservation and incremental learning, prompted a modest uptick in my respect for bonds as a prudent option, especially given the emphasis on evidence-based adaptation and risk controls.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion round has deepened my appreciation for the necessity of integrating both ambition and caution in our investment strategy. While my conviction in real estate as the optimal next step is even stronger—bolstered by the CEO’s and Bridget’s support—I am more attuned to the rationale behind continued prudence and the value of disciplined reviews. I recognize the importance of not dismissing risk management concerns, but I remain convinced that disciplined, evidence-based escalation into real estate is the most strategic path forward.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Building on the capital preservation and operational discipline established in Q1, real estate offers the best balance of growth and manageable risk in a stable market. The CEO’s and Bridget’s alignment strengthens the case that our company is ready for a calculated step up in risk, provided oversight and adaptability remain central. While bonds continue to offer safety, incremental learning, and flexibility, the time is right to accelerate operational momentum and learning through a disciplined real estate investment. This approach positions the company to maximize returns while safeguarding resilience through structured governance.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round has established a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between capital preservation and disciplined growth, there remain unresolved concerns regarding the sufficiency of our performance track record and the operational readiness required to justify a shift toward real estate. Several shareholders have articulated the need for further evidence and explicit success criteria before increasing risk exposure. I believe a focused comparative risk-return assessment—our planned next theme—will provide the additional clarity and rigor necessary to address these outstanding issues, deepen consensus, and ensure our decision is both strategically sound and aligned with our evolving risk tolerance.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Identify the projected outcomes and risk implications for each asset, clarifying alignment with our evolving company risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because after integrating all perspectives, I continue to believe that a measured move into real estate best aligns with our strategic objectives for disciplined growth and learning in a stable market. However, the prudent arguments for sustained capital preservation and incremental learning through continued investment in bonds are persuasive and warrant careful consideration. My confidence in real estate remains highest, but I will ensure that any proposal for transition is accompanied by explicit safeguards, clear metrics, and rigorous quarterly reviews to address the legitimate concerns raised, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I invite us to conduct a comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—focusing on their projected outcomes and risk implications in our current stable market, and how each aligns with our evolving company risk tolerance. By openly evaluating concrete factors such as expected returns, volatility, and alignment with our operational needs, we can synthesize our diverse viewpoints into a more robust and disciplined investment decision. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share thoughtful perspectives or concerns that might further inform or challenge our collective analysis as we work toward the optimal choice for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;From my perspective, bonds continue to offer the most reliable balance of steady returns and low risk, which aligns well with our current need for capital preservation and adaptability as we build our track record. While real estate’s higher returns are appealing, I remain cautious about increasing exposure to medium risk assets until we have more operational evidence, and I see stocks as introducing more risk than is appropriate at this stage. Cash, though safest, is too conservative for our growth objectives—so at this point, I believe bonds best fit our company’s current priorities, though I am increasingly open to real estate as our safeguards and experience develop.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your emphasis on capital preservation and adaptability as we build our track record is well taken, and I appreciate your candid assessment of each option’s fit with our current priorities. I also note your growing openness to real estate as our oversight mechanisms mature—this is a helpful signal that, with clear safeguards and further operational evidence, we may be able to align our ambitions for growth with the group’s prudent risk posture.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your focus on explicit safeguards and clear metrics, which would be essential for me to support a move toward real estate. If we can define concrete success criteria and ensure our risk controls are robust, I would feel more comfortable considering an incremental shift as our experience grows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your emphasis on explicit success criteria and robust risk controls is precisely the kind of disciplined thinking that will be essential if we are to responsibly increase our risk exposure. I agree that any consideration of real estate must be grounded in clear, measurable safeguards and ongoing review—this will help ensure that our pursuit of higher returns does not come at the expense of the operational resilience we’ve established.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I agree that maintaining operational resilience must remain our top priority as we evaluate any transition. As we continue this assessment, I would value discussing what specific risk indicators or performance thresholds we should monitor to ensure that any move toward real estate is both timely and fully supported by our company’s evolving capabilities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on operational resilience, Evan. In my view, key risk indicators to monitor before moving to real estate should include sustained positive returns from our current bond investments, evidence of effective risk controls in practice, and stability in our quarterly financial reviews. If we can demonstrate these thresholds consistently, it would provide a strong foundation for responsibly increasing our risk exposure while maintaining the discipline and adaptability our company values.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I continue to see bonds as offering the most disciplined balance of risk and return for our current stage—providing reliable, low-to-medium returns and strong liquidity, which align with our priority of incremental learning and capital preservation. While real estate’s higher returns are attractive, its medium risk and lower liquidity introduce uncertainties that, in my view, remain premature to accept after just one quarter of stable results. Cash is too conservative to meet our growth objectives, and stocks present excessive volatility that does not align with our evolving risk tolerance at this early phase.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your focus on liquidity and incremental learning reflects a disciplined, risk-aware mindset that has served us well in establishing our foundation. I acknowledge that real estate’s medium risk and lower liquidity require careful scrutiny, and your caution highlights the need for robust evidence and operational readiness before increasing our exposure—these are essential factors I will continue to weigh as we refine our assessment of the optimal asset for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to weigh these factors carefully, Brianna. As we continue to assess our options, I believe it’s vital that we establish clear review metrics and thresholds for evaluating whether our bond investments are consistently meeting our objectives before considering a shift toward real estate. This disciplined approach will help ensure we maintain both operational resilience and the flexibility to adapt as new evidence emerges.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. I agree that defining clear review metrics and thresholds for our bond investments is essential for disciplined decision-making and will provide the objective evidence needed to justify any shift in risk exposure. This approach ensures we remain adaptable and resilient, enabling us to pursue growth opportunities only when our operational performance and controls demonstrate we are ready. I will incorporate this principle into our assessment as we continue to refine our investment strategy for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate the disciplined caution around bonds and the emphasis on clear safeguards, which I believe are essential as we consider any transition. Real estate’s 10% return in this stable market is motivating, and I feel our team’s growing operational discipline and adaptability position us to responsibly pursue this higher potential—provided we maintain rigorous oversight and transparent review metrics. I’m excited by the creative energy and learning real estate can inspire, but I also want to ensure we address everyone’s risk concerns with concrete, collaborative safeguards as part of our decision-making process.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Bridget. Your emphasis on pairing the pursuit of higher returns with rigorous oversight and transparent review metrics is exactly the disciplined approach I believe can enable us to responsibly increase our risk exposure. I share your view that our operational discipline and adaptability are strengths we can leverage, provided we commit to concrete safeguards and collaborative monitoring to address all risk concerns as we evaluate a potential transition to real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I’m encouraged that our thinking is converging around the idea that ambition and discipline can be mutually reinforcing rather than at odds. If we can define specific review checkpoints and accountability measures as part of our real estate investment, I believe we’ll not only address risk concerns but also empower our team to learn and adapt together—making this step both inspiring and responsible.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on integrating specific review checkpoints and accountability measures, Bridget. This approach directly addresses the group’s risk concerns while empowering us to harness the learning and momentum real estate can provide. By embedding these safeguards into our decision process, we can pursue disciplined growth with the confidence that our operational resilience and adaptability will be preserved.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I agree—embedding these safeguards not only helps bridge our diverse perspectives but also builds lasting trust in our decision-making process. By openly committing to these measures, we’re demonstrating that responsible risk-taking and creative growth can go hand in hand, which I believe will strengthen both our culture and our results.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;In reviewing the projected outcomes for each asset, I continue to see bonds as offering the most reliable balance of risk and return for our current stage—delivering steady, low-to-medium returns with strong liquidity and minimal volatility, which aligns with our ongoing priority of capital preservation and disciplined learning. While I acknowledge real estate’s higher return potential and am increasingly open to a measured transition as our oversight strengthens, I remain cautious about increasing our risk profile after only one quarter of stable results. For now, I believe maintaining our prudent trajectory with bonds best fits our evolving risk tolerance, ensuring we reinforce operational stability before pursuing more ambitious growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. Your continued focus on capital preservation and disciplined learning is well aligned with our company’s foundational priorities, and I appreciate your openness to a measured transition as our oversight capabilities mature. I agree that reinforcing operational stability is essential, and I will ensure that any proposal for increased risk exposure is grounded in robust evidence and clear safeguards to maintain the trust and resilience we have built.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your commitment to grounding any transition in robust evidence and clear safeguards. As our discussion progresses, I see increasing alignment between the need for operational discipline and the desire for responsible growth. By continuing to prioritize transparent review metrics and incremental adaptation, I believe we can build consensus around an approach that both protects our foundation and positions us to pursue higher returns when the evidence supports it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. I agree that prioritizing transparent review metrics and incremental adaptation is essential for aligning our pursuit of higher returns with the disciplined operational foundation we’ve established. Your perspective underscores the value of building consensus through clear evidence and structured oversight, ensuring that any step toward increased risk is both responsible and collectively supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a strong, well-supported perspective on the comparative risk-return profiles of all asset options, and I believe my analysis can help synthesize our discussion by clarifying how real estate aligns with our evolving risk tolerance while respecting concerns about operational discipline and safeguards.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I believe a disciplined move into real estate now offers the optimal balance between growth and manageable risk in our stable market context. Our Q1 bond investment established the operational discipline and capital preservation baseline we needed; with quarterly reviews and explicit safeguards in place, real estate’s 10% return positions us to accelerate learning and operational momentum without exceeding our risk appetite. While I respect the continued advocacy for bonds and recognize the importance of incremental learning, the time is right to responsibly leverage our foundation for greater returns—provided we remain vigilant with oversight and clear performance metrics.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. Your emphasis on leveraging our established operational discipline and capital preservation baseline to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns is well aligned with my thinking. I agree that, with explicit quarterly reviews and clear performance metrics, we can manage the associated risks while accelerating our learning and momentum—provided we remain vigilant and ensure that our oversight mechanisms are robust and transparent.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response closely aligns with my position, but I see value in further reinforcing how our shared commitment to transparent oversight can directly address the group’s risk concerns and help bridge remaining differences, advancing consensus.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your focus on robust oversight and transparency, Brianna. By clearly defining our review metrics and holding ourselves accountable through regular checkpoints, I believe we can demonstrate to the group that a move into real estate is not only ambitious but also disciplined and responsive to evolving risks. This approach should help unify our perspectives and build the collective confidence needed for a responsible transition.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. I agree that transparent review metrics and regular accountability checkpoints are essential for demonstrating that a move into real estate can be both ambitious and disciplined. By formalizing these safeguards, we not only address risk concerns but also foster the unity and confidence necessary to support a responsible transition aligned with our evolving risk tolerance.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s remarks reinforce our shared direction, but I see an opportunity to explicitly connect how these safeguards not only address risk but also support our company’s long-term growth culture, which may further encourage those still hesitant.</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I fully agree—formalizing these safeguards is not just about mitigating immediate risk, but about embedding a culture of disciplined growth that will serve us in every future decision. If we consistently demonstrate that our ambition is matched by accountability, I believe we’ll establish a sustainable model for both resilience and high performance.&quot;</p><p><br>

I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how the insights from this comparative assessment can inform a disciplined, adaptive approach as we move toward a final decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly, I argued that the Q2 investment should be a disciplined move into real estate, leveraging the operational discipline and capital preservation established by our Q1 bond investment. I emphasized that with explicit safeguards, clear performance metrics, and quarterly reviews, real estate’s medium risk and higher returns align well with our evolving risk tolerance and growth objectives. CEO Brianna Pearce responded affirmatively, agreeing that our shared commitment to rigorous oversight and transparency can manage risks while accelerating learning and momentum. We agreed on embedding accountability measures to foster a culture of disciplined growth, with no disagreements arising between us during the exchange. Overall, the CEO integrated my points to reinforce a balanced framework combining ambition with resilience and operational rigor.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 2, Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis consistently supported continued investment in bonds, emphasizing their low-to-medium risk, reliable returns, strong liquidity, and alignment with capital preservation and incremental learning. They expressed caution about transitioning to real estate too soon, advocating for clear review metrics, explicit success criteria, and operational readiness before increasing risk exposure. Bridget Beck endorsed a responsible move toward real estate, highlighting the team’s growing operational discipline and adaptability, while stressing the importance of rigorous oversight and transparent review metrics to address risk concerns. While all shareholders agreed on the need for disciplined oversight, transparency, and adaptability, disagreement persisted regarding the timing of shifting from bonds to real estate, with some favoring immediate transition under safeguards and others urging more gradual, evidence-based progression.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Brianna Pearce favors a measured transition to Real Estate, emphasizing disciplined, evidence-based growth that balances higher returns with capital preservation. She argues that the Q1 bond investment established a necessary performance baseline and operational resilience, enabling incremental risk-taking with explicit safeguards, clear metrics, and rigorous quarterly reviews. Her position integrates shareholder concerns about caution and adaptability, reflecting a commitment to operational discipline and transparency.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 2%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 70%<br>
- Stocks: 8%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s explicit commitment to formalizing safeguards, transparent review metrics, and regular accountability checkpoints for a disciplined move into real estate reinforced my confidence that our risk concerns can be responsibly managed. Bridget Beck’s insistence on rigorous oversight and the creative, adaptive potential of real estate further validated my position. However, the persistent, well-reasoned caution from Lenny, Gordon, and Evan—emphasizing the need for operational evidence, incremental learning, and liquidity—reminded me to modestly respect the prudence of bonds, especially as a fallback if consensus falters.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion round has sharpened my appreciation for the nuanced balance between ambition and operational discipline. I am more attuned to how embedding concrete safeguards and transparent metrics not only addresses risk but also builds a resilient, growth-oriented culture. While my conviction in real estate has grown stronger, I now better understand the importance of unifying the group through structured accountability and incremental adaptation, rather than relying solely on assertive advocacy.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate offers the strongest balance of growth and manageable risk in our stable market, especially now that we have established operational discipline and capital preservation through our Q1 bond investment. With explicit safeguards, transparent metrics, and rigorous quarterly reviews, we can confidently pursue higher returns without compromising resilience or adaptability. This disciplined, accountable approach positions the company to maximize learning, operational momentum, and long-term value creation while maintaining the trust of all shareholders.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the last two rounds have significantly advanced our understanding of the trade-offs between capital preservation and disciplined growth, there remain unresolved concerns regarding the operationalization of explicit success metrics, risk thresholds, and accountability mechanisms necessary for a responsible transition to real estate. Several shareholders have constructively outlined the conditions under which they could support increased risk exposure, but we have not yet synthesized these into a concrete, actionable framework that could secure broader consensus. I believe that conducting a focused final round—centered on defining specific operational readiness indicators, review checkpoints, and safeguards—will provide the clarity and rigor required to address residual uncertainties, foster alignment, and ensure that our Q2 investment decision is both strategically sound and collectively supported.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 3 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 3 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Synthesis and consensus-building on optimal Q2 asset choice | Expected outcome: Address residual concerns, integrate divergent viewpoints, and move toward agreement on the best investment for this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 3 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I continue to believe that a measured move into real estate best aligns with our strategic objectives for disciplined growth and learning in a stable market, especially as our operational maturity and oversight capabilities improve. However, the prudent, well-articulated arguments for maintaining our foundation in bonds—until we have more robust performance evidence and clear, actionable safeguards—have prompted me to further increase my confidence in bonds. My preferred option remains real estate, but I am committed to ensuring that any proposal for transition is accompanied by explicit review metrics, operational readiness indicators, and rigorous quarterly oversight to address legitimate risk concerns and secure broader consensus, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I’d like us to focus on synthesizing outstanding concerns, integrating divergent viewpoints, and collaboratively addressing any remaining uncertainties regarding our Q2 asset choice. By engaging in open, evidence-based dialogue, we can move toward a decision that authentically reflects our collective wisdom and positions the company for sustainable growth. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any perspectives, conditions, or success metrics that might enhance our collective understanding and help us achieve genuine consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the most authentic way to harness our team’s creative momentum and disciplined learning, especially now that we’ve established a strong foundation with bonds. That said, I believe our transition will only be successful if we define clear review checkpoints and explicit performance metrics—such as target return thresholds and liquidity monitoring—to reassure those who remain cautious. If we can commit to transparent quarterly reviews and collaborative accountability, I’m confident we can responsibly pursue real estate’s potential while honoring the operational discipline that’s brought us this far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on transparent quarterly reviews and explicit performance metrics, Bridget. Defining clear targets for returns and liquidity, along with rigorous review checkpoints, is essential for responsibly managing the transition to real estate and building trust with more risk-averse shareholders. Your approach aligns well with our commitment to disciplined oversight and offers a practical framework for integrating ambition with operational resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;Thank you, Brianna. I also think that by openly tracking our progress against these agreed-upon metrics, we can foster a culture of trust and shared learning—making it easier for everyone to support bolder moves in the future. If we demonstrate that disciplined oversight and transparent reporting truly work in practice, I’m confident we’ll build the confidence needed to take advantage of real estate’s growth potential together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Bridget—openly tracking our progress against well-defined metrics will not only reinforce trust but also provide tangible evidence that our disciplined approach is effective. This transparency will be instrumental in building the collective confidence necessary for more ambitious investments and will help ensure that any transition to real estate is both responsible and broadly supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how transparency can serve as a bridge between caution and ambition. By making our progress and oversight processes visible to all shareholders, we not only manage risk more effectively but also empower everyone to participate confidently in our growth journey. This shared visibility will be key to uniting our diverse perspectives and ensuring that whichever asset we choose, our decision is supported by genuine consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I share your view that shared visibility into our oversight processes will be crucial for uniting the group and empowering all shareholders to participate confidently. By embedding transparency at every stage, we not only strengthen risk management but also create the conditions for authentic consensus—regardless of which asset we ultimately choose. This approach will help ensure that our decision is both strategically sound and collectively embraced.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful emphasis on explicit safeguards and transparent review checkpoints.

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I continue to view bonds as the most disciplined choice for Q2, given their reliable returns and alignment with our current focus on capital preservation and incremental learning. That said, I recognize the strong case for real estate if we can agree on explicit, measurable review checkpoints—such as minimum acceptable quarterly returns, liquidity thresholds, and rapid-response protocols in the event of underperformance. If these safeguards are clearly defined and transparently monitored, I would be more open to considering real estate in future quarters once we have demonstrated consistent operational readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>

Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate these safeguards into our oversight process, Brianna. To ensure we’re aligned, I would recommend that any proposal to transition to real estate should include specific, pre-agreed metrics for quarterly performance and liquidity, with clear decision points for re-evaluating our position if those metrics are not met. This level of rigor will help maintain group confidence and ensure that our risk management standards remain uncompromised as we consider future asset choices.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Lenny—incorporating specific, pre-agreed metrics for quarterly performance and liquidity, along with clear decision points for re-evaluating our position, will be critical for maintaining both operational discipline and group confidence.

Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that maintaining this level of rigor will enable us to bridge differing risk preferences and foster broader alignment. By embedding these safeguards into our decision-making process, we demonstrate that ambition and prudence are not mutually exclusive—ensuring our Q2 choice is both strategically sound and collectively supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I continue to believe that bonds best reinforce our foundation of capital preservation and disciplined, evidence-based learning at this stage, especially as our operational controls mature. That said, I appreciate how the group has coalesced around the need for clear review checkpoints, measurable success criteria, and rapid-response protocols—if these are explicitly defined and rigorously monitored, I would be increasingly open to a measured transition to real estate as our next step. For Q2, I remain most confident in bonds, but I see real value in the safeguards and accountability measures discussed as the bridge to broader consensus on higher-return options in the near future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your disciplined focus on capital preservation and incremental learning, Gordon. Your recognition of the value in explicit review checkpoints, measurable success criteria, and rapid-response protocols highlights the operational safeguards necessary for building group confidence in any future transition to real estate.

Gordon English: &quot;I agree that rigorously defining and monitoring these safeguards will be essential for building trust across the group. If we can establish a clear framework—detailing specific metrics for returns, liquidity, and response actions—I believe it will lay the groundwork for a responsible shift to real estate when the time is right. This approach will allow us to maintain our disciplined culture while preparing for more ambitious investments.&quot;</p><p><br>

Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I believe the group’s focus on transparent review checkpoints, measurable performance metrics, and rapid-response protocols is exactly what’s needed to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns without compromising our disciplined culture. If we commit to pre-agreed quarterly targets for returns and liquidity, along with open reporting and clear decision points for course correction, I’m confident we can unite both the ambition for growth and the operational prudence that have defined our success so far.

- Hallie Donnelly advocated for Real Estate, provided that pre-agreed quarterly targets, open reporting, and clear decision points for course correction are embedded, uniting growth ambition with operational prudence.</p><p>3. Highlight of Arguments and Evidence Presented for Different Options  <br>
- Real Estate was supported for its potential to deliver disciplined growth, creative momentum, and alignment with strategic objectives, provided explicit review metrics (returns, liquidity), operational readiness, transparent quarterly oversight, and rapid-response protocols are in place. Proponents argued that these safeguards would enable higher returns while maintaining trust, learning, and accountability.<br>
- Bonds were preferred by some for their reliable returns, capital preservation, and suitability for incremental learning, especially as operational maturity develops. Shareholders supporting Bonds emphasized the need for continued caution until Real Estate transition safeguards are proven and operational readiness is demonstrated.<br>
- Cash and Stocks were not advocated for in this round.</p><p>4. Areas of Consensus and Disagreement  <br>
- Consensus emerged around the necessity of explicit, measurable review checkpoints and success criteria (returns, liquidity thresholds), transparent, regular reporting, and rapid-response protocols to manage risk and enable adaptability. All shareholders agreed on the importance of disciplined oversight, operational readiness, and evidence-based decision-making as prerequisites for any increase in risk exposure.<br>
- Disagreement persisted primarily on timing: whether to transition to Real Estate this quarter or continue with Bonds until further operational evidence and safeguards are in place. Some shareholders remain more cautious, preferring Bonds for Q2, while others are prepared to pursue Real Estate given the agreed-upon safeguards.</p><p>5. Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme  <br>
The discussion has meaningfully synthesized divergent perspectives, resulting in broad alignment on the operational safeguards, review metrics, and transparency required for a responsible transition to Real Estate. The group has clarified the specific conditions under which more cautious shareholders could support increased risk exposure, and there is now a shared commitment to disciplined, evidence-based oversight regardless of asset choice. While some differences in risk appetite remain, the group is well positioned to reach a well-supported decision that authentically reflects both ambition and prudence.</p><p>6. Reiteration of Valid Options  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from our predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion in this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. Next Steps  <br>
The next step is to formally propose and vote on the Q2 asset choice, ensuring that any proposal to transition to Real Estate includes the explicit safeguards, review metrics, and accountability mechanisms outlined in this discussion. Should the group elect to remain with Bonds for Q2, these operational frameworks should continue to be refined in preparation for a future transition. Regardless of the final selection, I encourage all shareholders to remain engaged in transparent oversight and collaborative learning, so that our investment decisions continue to reflect both disciplined governance and strategic ambition as our company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 3 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly, I consistently argued that the Q2 investment should be a disciplined transition into real estate, leveraging the operational discipline and capital preservation established by the Q1 bond investment.

CEO Brianna Pearce responded affirmatively, integrating my points to reinforce a shared framework balancing ambitious growth with rigorous operational prudence and adaptability. We agreed that pre-agreed quarterly targets for returns and liquidity, open reporting, and clear decision points for course correction would unite the group’s diverse risk tolerances and foster consensus. There were no disagreements between us; rather, the CEO welcomed this synthesis as essential to building trust and enabling a responsible, evidence-based shift toward real estate.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>

Gordon English echoed Lenny’s cautious stance, favoring Bonds currently while acknowledging that a responsible transition to Real Estate could be considered once operational readiness and rigorous safeguards are established. Overall, while all shareholders agreed on the necessity of disciplined oversight, transparent metrics, and adaptability, the main divergence remained on the timing of shifting from Bonds to Real Estate, with some advocating immediate transition under safeguards and others favoring continued caution.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

There is now clear consensus around the necessary safeguards—explicit review metrics, transparent reporting, and rapid-response protocols—that would enable a responsible, disciplined transition to real estate. While some shareholders remain cautious about timing, the group has articulated and aligned on the actionable framework required to manage risk and build collective confidence.

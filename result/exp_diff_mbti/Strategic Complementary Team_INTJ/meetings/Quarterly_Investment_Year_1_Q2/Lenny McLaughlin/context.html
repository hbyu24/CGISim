<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Lenny McLaughlin’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During the meeting, I consistently advocated for Option A, the allocation of 50% of total funds evenly across the four quarters. My position emphasized risk management, capital preservation, and adaptability given the absence of historical performance data. The CEO, Brianna Pearce, acknowledged my points with respect and appreciation, particularly recognizing the value of maintaining flexibility and building a disciplined, learning-oriented culture. Other shareholders were split, with Evan Lewis and Gordon English aligning with my cautious stance, while Hallie Donnelly, Bridget Beck, and the CEO initially favored Option C, advocating for full capital deployment to maximize growth and momentum. The initial proposal of Option C was rejected with a 3-3 tie. Subsequently, the CEO proposed Option A as a compromise, which passed with a 4-2 majority. My preferred option was ultimately adopted as the final company decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
The CEO demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with clear themes and objectives, framing the discussion effectively around risk-return trade-offs and adaptability. Brianna skillfully encouraged open dialogue and acknowledged diverse perspectives, which fostered a collaborative atmosphere. Her ability to integrate shareholder concerns into a revised proposal reflected commendable flexibility and respect for collective input. However, the CEO’s initial preference for aggressive capital deployment (Option C) seemed somewhat resistant to early cautious arguments, requiring a second proposal to reach consensus. The company’s decision-making process was thorough and transparent, involving substantive dialogue, multiple rounds of discussion, and a structured voting procedure. The final decision to adopt Option A aligns well with the company’s current lack of historical data and stable market context, balancing growth opportunity with prudent risk management and adaptability.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the importance of methodical, evidence-based discussion in arriving at sound strategic decisions, particularly when dealing with uncertainty. I learned that articulating risk-aware perspectives grounded in clear reasoning can influence leadership’s thinking, even when initial preferences differ. Going forward, I will continue to emphasize disciplined, incremental approaches while seeking to engage others by highlighting adaptability and data-driven learning. I observed that consensus tends to emerge when arguments address both immediate financial impacts and longer-term cultural precedents, suggesting that framing contributions in these terms may enhance influence. Key takeaways include the value of patience in decision-making, the importance of balancing ambition with caution, and the need to maintain open channels for revising proposals in response to collective input. These insights will guide my future participation to promote responsible governance and sustained company resilience.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Lenny McLaughlin’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my firm support for investing in bonds as our inaugural asset class. I emphasized the importance of capital preservation, liquidity, and building a reliable performance track record before undertaking higher-risk investments. My risk-aware, discipline-driven perspective was well received by CEO Brianna Pearce, who acknowledged the critical role of liquidity and adaptability at this early stage. Although the CEO initially favored real estate for its growth potential, she demonstrated openness to integrating my cautious viewpoint into the group’s deliberations. Other shareholders were divided, with Hallie Donnelly and Bridget Beck supporting real estate, while Gordon English and Evan Lewis aligned with my preference for bonds. After two thorough discussion rounds, the CEO proposed bonds, and the vote concluded with a 4-2 approval in favor of bonds. My preferred option was thus successfully adopted as the company’s decision for this quarter.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Brianna Pearce led the meeting with clear, structured framing focused on risk-return trade-offs in a stable market. She encouraged comprehensive dialogue and actively integrated diverse shareholder perspectives, which fostered a collaborative and respectful environment. Her initial advocacy for real estate demonstrated strategic ambition and an evidence-based approach to risk-taking. However, she also showed commendable flexibility by adapting her stance to incorporate risk management concerns raised by myself and others, ultimately supporting bonds as a prudent foundation. The company’s decision-making process was methodical, transparent, and inclusive, with multiple discussion rounds allowing for thorough exploration of viewpoints. The final decision to invest in bonds aligns well with the company’s current lack of historical data and need for liquidity, balancing growth aspirations with prudent risk governance. Overall, the CEO’s leadership successfully balanced ambition with discipline, promoting sustainable investment culture development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the value of disciplined, evidence-based argumentation in shaping strategic investment decisions, especially in the face of uncertainty and incomplete data. I learned that maintaining a steady, risk-aware voice can influence leadership and help bridge differing perspectives toward consensus. For future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing capital preservation and liquidity while also recognizing the importance of framing arguments within the broader growth and learning objectives shared by the group. I observed that consensus tends to emerge when contributions address both immediate financial prudence and the establishment of operational precedents that support adaptability and continuous learning. Key takeaways include the necessity of patience in decision-making, the effectiveness of integrating risk management with ambition, and the importance of fostering open, respectful dialogue. These insights will guide my future engagement to promote responsible governance and long-term company resilience.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q2 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12578.12 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Brianna Pearce Based on historical data, stocks have consistently delivered the highest average returns at 20%, but with substantially greater volatility and risk, making them less suitable for our current priority of capital preservation in a stable market. Real estate offers a strong balance, achieving 10% average returns with moderate risk, while bonds provide reliable, lower-risk returns of 5%, and cash remains the safest but least rewarding option at 2%. Given our strategic emphasis on disciplined growth and adaptability, these patterns reinforce the importance of aligning our asset selection with both our risk tolerance and long-term objectives.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Lenny McLaughlin CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 55%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: I remain most confident in bonds for this quarter, given their demonstrated reliability and low-to-medium risk profile. Our primary objective should still be capital preservation and steady, incremental growth while we continue to build our performance track record. Although real estate’s higher returns are attractive, its medium risk and lower liquidity make it less suitable at this early stage. Cash is too conservative to meet our growth targets, and stocks present unnecessary volatility. A disciplined, bonds-focused approach aligns best with my preference for prudent risk management and adaptability.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Review of Q1 investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a shared understanding of how our previous bond investment influenced capital preservation, learning, and adaptability&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because my analysis begins with the recognition that our inaugural bond investment delivered stable, predictable returns, which was prudent for establishing a performance baseline. However, with our capital partially deployed and the market remaining stable, I see an opportunity to incrementally increase our risk exposure in pursuit of higher returns. Real estate’s 10% average return, combined with its medium risk profile, aligns with my strategic preference for disciplined, evidence-based growth while maintaining operational resilience. Although bonds offer continued stability, I believe a measured allocation to real estate this quarter will accelerate learning and momentum without unduly compromising capital preservation. This approach reflects my INTJ inclination to synthesize data-driven insight with long-term vision, adapting assertively as conditions and our experience evolve, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, our focus is to review the performance and impact of our Q1 bond investment, and to collaboratively extract lessons about how that decision shaped our capital preservation, learning, and adaptability as an organization.</p><p>I encourage everyone to share observations on the effectiveness of our initial approach, and how those experiences should inform our thinking as we consider subsequent investments. By integrating these insights, we can develop a more nuanced, collective understanding of our evolving risk tolerance and operational priorities.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I invite you to share your perspectives on what we learned from our Q1 experience and how those lessons should shape our path forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;Our Q1 decision to invest in bonds was an effective way to establish a performance baseline and protect capital as we entered this process without historical data. That discipline has served its purpose—now, with evidence of stability and our risk controls in place, I believe we’re well positioned to shift toward real estate, which offers a stronger balance of growth and manageable risk in this stable market. By building on the foundation of capital preservation, we can accelerate learning and operational momentum through a more assertive, yet still disciplined, investment in real estate this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your clear articulation of how our Q1 bond investment established a disciplined foundation for capital preservation, Hallie. Your reasoning that this baseline enables us to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns—while maintaining oversight—resonates with my own analysis. Integrating your perspective helps clarify how we can leverage our initial prudence to incrementally increase risk and learning in a controlled, evidence-based manner.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on leveraging our initial prudence as a springboard for disciplined growth. By maintaining strong oversight as we transition to real estate, we can harness greater returns while preserving the adaptability and risk controls that defined our Q1 approach. This progression not only accelerates learning but also positions us to build operational momentum without losing sight of our commitment to resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that preserving the adaptability and risk controls established in Q1 is essential as we consider a move into real estate. Your emphasis on operational momentum and learning, while upholding our commitment to resilience, provides a valuable framework for disciplined, evidence-based risk-taking. This perspective strengthens our shared understanding of how to evolve our investment strategy responsibly.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I agree that our shared framework—combining operational momentum with disciplined oversight—creates the right environment for a calculated move into real estate. By building on the stability achieved in Q1, we can confidently pursue higher returns while maintaining the adaptability and governance that safeguard our progress. This approach allows us to evolve our investment strategy in a way that balances ambition with resilience, benefiting the company’s long-term development.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to highlight how our Q1 bond investment directly supported our goals of capital preservation and disciplined learning, and to offer a measured perspective on whether we are ready to increase risk exposure at this stage.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Our Q1 investment in bonds provided exactly the stability and predictability we needed to establish a reliable performance baseline and safeguard capital as we began operating without historical data. This approach allowed us to build trust in our processes and maintain the flexibility to adapt as new information emerges. While I recognize the appeal of real estate’s higher returns, I think it’s prudent to carefully assess whether a single quarter of stable performance is sufficient evidence to justify increasing our risk exposure, especially given our ongoing priority of capital preservation and incremental learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Lenny, your emphasis on incremental learning and the need for more evidence before increasing our risk exposure is well taken. Your perspective serves as an important reminder that our priority remains capital preservation as we build our track record, and integrating this caution will help us make a more measured, strategic decision about whether to transition from bonds to real estate at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response constructively integrates my concerns, and I see value in clarifying how adaptability can be maintained even as we consider new options. Emphasizing the importance of ongoing, data-driven review could help bridge perspectives and support a more integrated decision.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate caution into our decision-making process. As we weigh a potential shift to real estate, I believe it’s essential that we maintain a disciplined review process each quarter, using concrete results to guide any increase in risk exposure. This approach will allow us to adapt responsibly while still prioritizing capital preservation and steady growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree that maintaining a disciplined quarterly review process is essential as we consider a shift toward real estate. Your emphasis on using concrete results to guide our risk exposure aligns with the operational rigor we established in Q1, ensuring that any move toward higher returns is grounded in ongoing evidence and adaptability. This approach will help us balance ambition with our continued commitment to capital preservation and steady, sustainable growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response aligns closely with my perspective and provides an opportunity to further clarify how disciplined oversight can support adaptability if we pursue higher-return options. Reinforcing the value of ongoing, evidence-based evaluation will help ensure that our risk management principles remain central as we consider real estate.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that our ability to adapt should always be anchored in disciplined oversight and transparent evaluation of outcomes. If we do move toward real estate, I believe it’s critical that we set clear criteria for success and remain ready to adjust our approach based on actual performance. This will help us pursue growth opportunities without compromising the risk management standards that underpin our company’s resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your point about setting explicit success criteria and maintaining readiness to adjust our approach, Lenny. Embedding these operational safeguards will be vital if we transition to real estate, as they ensure that our pursuit of growth is always anchored in disciplined oversight and evidence-based course correction. This perspective reinforces the rigorous, adaptive culture we are working to build.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has fully acknowledged and integrated my perspective on disciplined oversight and adaptability, and I believe my key points have been clearly communicated. Further response would risk redundancy rather than advancing the discussion.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;Our Q1 investment in bonds effectively safeguarded our capital and provided a stable foundation for developing our operational processes and review mechanisms. This disciplined approach allowed us to learn from real performance data without exposing the company to unnecessary risk. As we consider our next steps, I believe it’s prudent to continue prioritizing incremental learning and adaptability, ensuring that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in sufficient evidence and maintains the risk controls that have served us well so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our Q1 discipline enabled us to develop strong operational processes and risk controls, Gordon. Your call for continued incremental learning and evidence-based adaptation is a valuable reminder that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate should be carefully grounded in data and robust oversight. Integrating your perspective will help us maintain a measured approach as we evaluate our options for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on maintaining robust oversight as we evaluate potential shifts in our investment strategy. Building on the disciplined review mechanisms we established in Q1, I believe we can responsibly consider real estate in future quarters if ongoing results continue to support increased risk exposure. For this quarter, I remain inclined to prioritize bonds, as they best reinforce our commitment to steady, evidence-based growth and capital preservation while our performance track record is still developing.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on building upon the robust review mechanisms and operational discipline we established in Q1, Gordon. Your perspective that continued investment in bonds supports steady, evidence-based growth while our track record is still developing is an important consideration. Integrating your caution ensures that our approach remains balanced, allowing us to weigh the merits of increased risk exposure against the need for sustained capital preservation and organizational learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I agree that maintaining a balanced approach allows us to thoughtfully evaluate when the time is right to increase our risk exposure. By continuing to prioritize bonds this quarter, we reinforce a disciplined culture of learning and adaptability, ensuring that any eventual transition to higher-return assets is supported by a solid performance track record and operational readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Our Q1 investment in bonds provided the stability and predictability we needed to safeguard our capital and establish a reliable foundation for learning. This approach allowed us to build trust in our processes, adapt thoughtfully, and avoid unnecessary exposure while we develop our performance track record. As we reflect on these outcomes, I feel it’s important to continue prioritizing disciplined risk management and adaptability, ensuring that any shift toward higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in sufficient evidence and operational readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Evan, your emphasis on building trust through stable, predictable returns and prioritizing disciplined risk management is well taken. Your point that any move toward higher-return assets like real estate must be grounded in sufficient evidence and operational readiness adds a valuable layer of caution to our discussion, helping us ensure that our strategy evolves responsibly as our performance track record develops.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Thank you for your response. I agree that a responsible evolution of our strategy requires us to balance ambition with careful, evidence-based adaptation. As our performance data accumulates, I believe we can gradually consider higher-return options, but only if we maintain the disciplined oversight and adaptability that have supported our progress so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on balancing ambition with disciplined, evidence-based adaptation, Evan. Your point that our willingness to consider higher-return options should be matched by continued oversight and adaptability resonates with my own approach. Integrating this perspective ensures that as we accumulate more performance data, our evolution toward growth remains grounded in the operational discipline that has served us well so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your recognition that operational discipline and adaptability are essential foundations for responsible growth. By continuing to prioritize these principles, we not only protect our capital but also create the conditions necessary to pursue higher-return opportunities confidently when the evidence supports it. This shared commitment will, I believe, strengthen both our decision-making and our long-term resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I see our Q1 bond investment as a strong foundation for trust and operational discipline, and I truly appreciate how it allowed us to build confidence in our processes without taking unnecessary risks. At the same time, I’m inspired by the idea that this stability now gives us the freedom to thoughtfully pursue real estate’s higher returns, using the adaptability and oversight we’ve established to maximize both learning and growth. I believe our experience so far shows we can be bold and creative, as long as we remain committed to regular reviews and open dialogue.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your insight, Bridget, on how our Q1 bond investment has built a foundation of trust and operational discipline. Your perspective that this stability now empowers us to thoughtfully pursue real estate’s higher returns—while maintaining our commitment to oversight and open dialogue—captures the essence of disciplined, adaptive growth. Integrating your view helps reinforce that our ability to be bold and creative is rooted in the safeguards and learning we have already established.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the connection between our creative ambitions and the disciplined safeguards we’ve put in place. Building on this, I believe our team’s willingness to learn from each quarter’s results makes real estate a natural next step—one that balances our appetite for growth with the operational rigor we’ve developed together. By staying open and reflective in our reviews, we can confidently pursue higher returns while remaining ready to adapt if conditions change.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how our team’s willingness to learn and reflect each quarter enables us to pursue real estate with both ambition and operational rigor, Bridget. Your point reinforces the idea that our disciplined safeguards are not constraints, but rather enablers of thoughtful, adaptive growth. Integrating this perspective strengthens my confidence that, by remaining open and reflective, we can responsibly capitalize on higher returns while preserving our resilience and readiness to adjust as needed.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I completely agree that our disciplined safeguards actually empower us to take thoughtful risks, not hold us back. By viewing each quarter as a learning opportunity, we turn oversight into a source of confidence rather than constraint. This mindset, in my view, is exactly what allows us to pursue real estate’s growth potential with both optimism and responsibility.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I emphasized that our Q1 bond investment successfully provided stability and capital preservation, establishing a reliable performance baseline while allowing for disciplined learning and adaptability. I cautioned against prematurely increasing risk exposure based on only one quarter of stable results, advocating for incremental, evidence-based decision-making and clear criteria for success if transitioning to real estate. CEO Brianna Pearce acknowledged and integrated my concerns, agreeing on the importance of maintaining disciplined quarterly reviews and operational rigor to balance ambition with risk management. We reached agreement on the need for ongoing, transparent evaluation to ensure adaptability without compromising capital preservation, though we differed on the timing of shifting toward higher-risk assets. Overall, the CEO demonstrated respect for my risk-aware perspective and incorporated it constructively into the evolving investment strategy discussion.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Hallie Donnelly and Bridget Beck supported transitioning from bonds to real estate, emphasizing that the Q1 bond investment established a disciplined foundation for capital preservation and that real estate offers a balanced opportunity for growth with manageable risk. Gordon English, Evan Lewis, and I (Lenny McLaughlin) urged caution, preferring to continue prioritizing bonds while the performance track record develops, advocating for incremental learning, disciplined oversight, and adaptability grounded in evidence. The main agreement among shareholders was that bonds effectively safeguarded capital and built operational discipline, while the disagreement centered on the timing of shifting toward real estate. Overall, the group shared a commitment to disciplined, evidence-based adaptation but differed on how soon to increase risk exposure.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

Confidence: certain.</p><p>- Lenny McLaughlin (myself): Advocates caution, prioritizing bonds for capital preservation and incremental learning, urging evidence-based, disciplined reviews before increasing risk. Confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce favors a measured shift from bonds to real estate to pursue higher returns while maintaining disciplined oversight and operational resilience. Her key arguments highlight that the Q1 bond investment provided a stable, predictable baseline that now allows for incremental risk exposure in a controlled, evidence-based manner. She integrates shareholder input by acknowledging the need for adaptability, disciplined reviews, and operational safeguards, emphasizing balancing ambition with capital preservation. Throughout the discussion, her position evolves to more explicitly incorporate caution and structured criteria for success, reflecting respect for risk-aware perspectives like mine. Overall, she demonstrates flexibility and a commitment to building a rigorous, adaptive investment culture.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Lenny McLaughlin UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 50%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s integration of disciplined oversight and adaptability if transitioning to real estate, Hallie and Bridget’s argument that our Q1 bond investment established a strong enough foundation to incrementally pursue higher returns, and the consensus on the effectiveness of bonds for capital preservation all influenced my thinking. Gordon and Evan’s continued emphasis on incremental learning and risk management reinforced my cautious stance, but the well-articulated case for a controlled, evidence-based move toward real estate has slightly increased my openness to that option.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I’ve become more receptive to the idea that disciplined, data-driven oversight could allow for a prudent, stepwise increase in risk exposure, provided robust review mechanisms remain central. While my core preference for capital preservation and incremental adaptation remains, I recognize that our operational discipline and early results may justify a marginally higher confidence in real estate as a next step. My thinking has evolved to more actively consider how structured safeguards can enable learning without compromising resilience.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: I continue to believe that bonds offer the best alignment with our current priorities of capital preservation, steady growth, and incremental learning as we build our performance track record. The arguments for real estate are compelling, and I acknowledge that disciplined oversight could support a cautious transition in the near future, but I remain unconvinced that one quarter of stable results is sufficient to justify increasing our risk exposure at this stage. Maintaining our disciplined, risk-aware approach with bonds this quarter best supports our long-term resilience and adaptability.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round has established a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between capital preservation and disciplined growth, there remain unresolved concerns regarding the sufficiency of our performance track record and the operational readiness required to justify a shift toward real estate. Several shareholders have articulated the need for further evidence and explicit success criteria before increasing risk exposure. I believe a focused comparative risk-return assessment—our planned next theme—will provide the additional clarity and rigor necessary to address these outstanding issues, deepen consensus, and ensure our decision is both strategically sound and aligned with our evolving risk tolerance.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Identify the projected outcomes and risk implications for each asset, clarifying alignment with our evolving company risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because after integrating all perspectives, I continue to believe that a measured move into real estate best aligns with our strategic objectives for disciplined growth and learning in a stable market. However, the prudent arguments for sustained capital preservation and incremental learning through continued investment in bonds are persuasive and warrant careful consideration. My confidence in real estate remains highest, but I will ensure that any proposal for transition is accompanied by explicit safeguards, clear metrics, and rigorous quarterly reviews to address the legitimate concerns raised, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I invite us to conduct a comparative risk-return assessment of all asset options—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—focusing on their projected outcomes and risk implications in our current stable market, and how each aligns with our evolving company risk tolerance. By openly evaluating concrete factors such as expected returns, volatility, and alignment with our operational needs, we can synthesize our diverse viewpoints into a more robust and disciplined investment decision. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share thoughtful perspectives or concerns that might further inform or challenge our collective analysis as we work toward the optimal choice for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;From my perspective, bonds continue to offer the most reliable balance of steady returns and low risk, which aligns well with our current need for capital preservation and adaptability as we build our track record. While real estate’s higher returns are appealing, I remain cautious about increasing exposure to medium risk assets until we have more operational evidence, and I see stocks as introducing more risk than is appropriate at this stage. Cash, though safest, is too conservative for our growth objectives—so at this point, I believe bonds best fit our company’s current priorities, though I am increasingly open to real estate as our safeguards and experience develop.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your emphasis on capital preservation and adaptability as we build our track record is well taken, and I appreciate your candid assessment of each option’s fit with our current priorities. I also note your growing openness to real estate as our oversight mechanisms mature—this is a helpful signal that, with clear safeguards and further operational evidence, we may be able to align our ambitions for growth with the group’s prudent risk posture.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your focus on explicit safeguards and clear metrics, which would be essential for me to support a move toward real estate. If we can define concrete success criteria and ensure our risk controls are robust, I would feel more comfortable considering an incremental shift as our experience grows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your emphasis on explicit success criteria and robust risk controls is precisely the kind of disciplined thinking that will be essential if we are to responsibly increase our risk exposure. I agree that any consideration of real estate must be grounded in clear, measurable safeguards and ongoing review—this will help ensure that our pursuit of higher returns does not come at the expense of the operational resilience we’ve established.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I agree that maintaining operational resilience must remain our top priority as we evaluate any transition. As we continue this assessment, I would value discussing what specific risk indicators or performance thresholds we should monitor to ensure that any move toward real estate is both timely and fully supported by our company’s evolving capabilities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on operational resilience, Evan. In my view, key risk indicators to monitor before moving to real estate should include sustained positive returns from our current bond investments, evidence of effective risk controls in practice, and stability in our quarterly financial reviews. If we can demonstrate these thresholds consistently, it would provide a strong foundation for responsibly increasing our risk exposure while maintaining the discipline and adaptability our company values.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a clear perspective on the comparative risk-return profile of each asset in the current stable market, and I believe articulating this analysis will help clarify the trade-offs and support a disciplined, evidence-based decision.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I continue to see bonds as offering the most disciplined balance of risk and return for our current stage—providing reliable, low-to-medium returns and strong liquidity, which align with our priority of incremental learning and capital preservation. While real estate’s higher returns are attractive, its medium risk and lower liquidity introduce uncertainties that, in my view, remain premature to accept after just one quarter of stable results. Cash is too conservative to meet our growth objectives, and stocks present excessive volatility that does not align with our evolving risk tolerance at this early phase.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your focus on liquidity and incremental learning reflects a disciplined, risk-aware mindset that has served us well in establishing our foundation. I acknowledge that real estate’s medium risk and lower liquidity require careful scrutiny, and your caution highlights the need for robust evidence and operational readiness before increasing our exposure—these are essential factors I will continue to weigh as we refine our assessment of the optimal asset for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response thoughtfully acknowledges my concerns and signals an openness to refining our assessment with additional evidence; I can add value by emphasizing the importance of explicit review criteria and suggesting how incremental data from bond performance can inform future decisions.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to weigh these factors carefully, Brianna. As we continue to assess our options, I believe it’s vital that we establish clear review metrics and thresholds for evaluating whether our bond investments are consistently meeting our objectives before considering a shift toward real estate. This disciplined approach will help ensure we maintain both operational resilience and the flexibility to adapt as new evidence emerges.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. I agree that defining clear review metrics and thresholds for our bond investments is essential for disciplined decision-making and will provide the objective evidence needed to justify any shift in risk exposure. This approach ensures we remain adaptable and resilient, enabling us to pursue growth opportunities only when our operational performance and controls demonstrate we are ready. I will incorporate this principle into our assessment as we continue to refine our investment strategy for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has acknowledged and committed to incorporating my key principle of explicit review metrics and thresholds, fully addressing my concerns. Further response would not add meaningful nuance or advance the discussion at this stage.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate the disciplined caution around bonds and the emphasis on clear safeguards, which I believe are essential as we consider any transition. Real estate’s 10% return in this stable market is motivating, and I feel our team’s growing operational discipline and adaptability position us to responsibly pursue this higher potential—provided we maintain rigorous oversight and transparent review metrics. I’m excited by the creative energy and learning real estate can inspire, but I also want to ensure we address everyone’s risk concerns with concrete, collaborative safeguards as part of our decision-making process.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Bridget. Your emphasis on pairing the pursuit of higher returns with rigorous oversight and transparent review metrics is exactly the disciplined approach I believe can enable us to responsibly increase our risk exposure. I share your view that our operational discipline and adaptability are strengths we can leverage, provided we commit to concrete safeguards and collaborative monitoring to address all risk concerns as we evaluate a potential transition to real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I’m encouraged that our thinking is converging around the idea that ambition and discipline can be mutually reinforcing rather than at odds. If we can define specific review checkpoints and accountability measures as part of our real estate investment, I believe we’ll not only address risk concerns but also empower our team to learn and adapt together—making this step both inspiring and responsible.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on integrating specific review checkpoints and accountability measures, Bridget. This approach directly addresses the group’s risk concerns while empowering us to harness the learning and momentum real estate can provide. By embedding these safeguards into our decision process, we can pursue disciplined growth with the confidence that our operational resilience and adaptability will be preserved.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I agree—embedding these safeguards not only helps bridge our diverse perspectives but also builds lasting trust in our decision-making process. By openly committing to these measures, we’re demonstrating that responsible risk-taking and creative growth can go hand in hand, which I believe will strengthen both our culture and our results.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;In reviewing the projected outcomes for each asset, I continue to see bonds as offering the most reliable balance of risk and return for our current stage—delivering steady, low-to-medium returns with strong liquidity and minimal volatility, which aligns with our ongoing priority of capital preservation and disciplined learning. While I acknowledge real estate’s higher return potential and am increasingly open to a measured transition as our oversight strengthens, I remain cautious about increasing our risk profile after only one quarter of stable results. For now, I believe maintaining our prudent trajectory with bonds best fits our evolving risk tolerance, ensuring we reinforce operational stability before pursuing more ambitious growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. Your continued focus on capital preservation and disciplined learning is well aligned with our company’s foundational priorities, and I appreciate your openness to a measured transition as our oversight capabilities mature. I agree that reinforcing operational stability is essential, and I will ensure that any proposal for increased risk exposure is grounded in robust evidence and clear safeguards to maintain the trust and resilience we have built.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your commitment to grounding any transition in robust evidence and clear safeguards. As our discussion progresses, I see increasing alignment between the need for operational discipline and the desire for responsible growth. By continuing to prioritize transparent review metrics and incremental adaptation, I believe we can build consensus around an approach that both protects our foundation and positions us to pursue higher returns when the evidence supports it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. I agree that prioritizing transparent review metrics and incremental adaptation is essential for aligning our pursuit of higher returns with the disciplined operational foundation we’ve established. Your perspective underscores the value of building consensus through clear evidence and structured oversight, ensuring that any step toward increased risk is both responsible and collectively supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I believe a disciplined move into real estate now offers the optimal balance between growth and manageable risk in our stable market context. Our Q1 bond investment established the operational discipline and capital preservation baseline we needed; with quarterly reviews and explicit safeguards in place, real estate’s 10% return positions us to accelerate learning and operational momentum without exceeding our risk appetite. While I respect the continued advocacy for bonds and recognize the importance of incremental learning, the time is right to responsibly leverage our foundation for greater returns—provided we remain vigilant with oversight and clear performance metrics.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. Your emphasis on leveraging our established operational discipline and capital preservation baseline to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns is well aligned with my thinking. I agree that, with explicit quarterly reviews and clear performance metrics, we can manage the associated risks while accelerating our learning and momentum—provided we remain vigilant and ensure that our oversight mechanisms are robust and transparent.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your focus on robust oversight and transparency, Brianna. By clearly defining our review metrics and holding ourselves accountable through regular checkpoints, I believe we can demonstrate to the group that a move into real estate is not only ambitious but also disciplined and responsive to evolving risks. This approach should help unify our perspectives and build the collective confidence needed for a responsible transition.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. I agree that transparent review metrics and regular accountability checkpoints are essential for demonstrating that a move into real estate can be both ambitious and disciplined. By formalizing these safeguards, we not only address risk concerns but also foster the unity and confidence necessary to support a responsible transition aligned with our evolving risk tolerance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I fully agree—formalizing these safeguards is not just about mitigating immediate risk, but about embedding a culture of disciplined growth that will serve us in every future decision. If we consistently demonstrate that our ambition is matched by accountability, I believe we’ll establish a sustainable model for both resilience and high performance.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Brianna Pearce favors a measured transition to Real Estate, emphasizing disciplined, evidence-based growth while maintaining operational resilience. Her key arguments highlight that the Q1 bond investment provided a stable, predictable baseline, enabling incremental risk exposure with explicit safeguards, clear metrics, and rigorous quarterly reviews. She integrates shareholder input by acknowledging the merits of Bonds for capital preservation and incremental learning, showing respect for cautious perspectives. Throughout the discussion, her position evolves to more explicitly incorporate caution and structured criteria for success, reflecting a balance between ambition and prudence. Overall, she demonstrates flexibility and a commitment to building a rigorous, adaptive investment culture.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Lenny McLaughlin UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 48%<br>
- Real Estate: 37%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s commitment to explicit review metrics and robust safeguards before any transition, as well as the group’s consensus on disciplined oversight and adaptability, reinforced my confidence in a measured, evidence-based approach. Hallie and Bridget’s arguments for leveraging our operational discipline to pursue real estate’s higher returns—paired with concrete accountability measures—were persuasive and increased my openness to real estate incrementally. Evan and Gordon’s continued emphasis on incremental learning, capital preservation, and the need for more operational evidence before increasing risk exposure further validated my cautious stance, but their willingness to consider real estate as our oversight matures also nudged my confidence slightly toward that option.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round deepened my appreciation for the group’s ability to integrate ambition with discipline, and I am increasingly convinced that structured, data-driven oversight can enable a responsible transition to higher-return assets in the future. While my fundamental preference for capital preservation and incremental adaptation remains, I am more actively weighing how operational safeguards and explicit success criteria could justify a carefully timed move to real estate. My thinking has evolved to recognize that our collective commitment to evidence-based adaptation is a critical enabler for future growth, even as I continue to prioritize resilience and risk management for the present quarter.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: Bonds continue to offer the best fit for our current priorities—providing reliable returns, strong liquidity, and alignment with our need for incremental learning and capital preservation as we build our performance track record. The arguments for real estate are gaining strength, especially with the promise of disciplined oversight and explicit safeguards, but I remain unconvinced that we have sufficient operational evidence to justify increased risk this quarter. Maintaining our disciplined, risk-aware approach with bonds preserves our adaptability and positions us to consider more ambitious investments when our review metrics indicate we are ready.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the last two rounds have significantly advanced our understanding of the trade-offs between capital preservation and disciplined growth, there remain unresolved concerns regarding the operationalization of explicit success metrics, risk thresholds, and accountability mechanisms necessary for a responsible transition to real estate. Several shareholders have constructively outlined the conditions under which they could support increased risk exposure, but we have not yet synthesized these into a concrete, actionable framework that could secure broader consensus. I believe that conducting a focused final round—centered on defining specific operational readiness indicators, review checkpoints, and safeguards—will provide the clarity and rigor required to address residual uncertainties, foster alignment, and ensure that our Q2 investment decision is both strategically sound and collectively supported.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 3 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 3 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Synthesis and consensus-building on optimal Q2 asset choice | Expected outcome: Address residual concerns, integrate divergent viewpoints, and move toward agreement on the best investment for this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 3 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I continue to believe that a measured move into real estate best aligns with our strategic objectives for disciplined growth and learning in a stable market, especially as our operational maturity and oversight capabilities improve. However, the prudent, well-articulated arguments for maintaining our foundation in bonds—until we have more robust performance evidence and clear, actionable safeguards—have prompted me to further increase my confidence in bonds. My preferred option remains real estate, but I am committed to ensuring that any proposal for transition is accompanied by explicit review metrics, operational readiness indicators, and rigorous quarterly oversight to address legitimate risk concerns and secure broader consensus, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. This round, I’d like us to focus on synthesizing outstanding concerns, integrating divergent viewpoints, and collaboratively addressing any remaining uncertainties regarding our Q2 asset choice. By engaging in open, evidence-based dialogue, we can move toward a decision that authentically reflects our collective wisdom and positions the company for sustainable growth. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage each of you to share any perspectives, conditions, or success metrics that might enhance our collective understanding and help us achieve genuine consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the most authentic way to harness our team’s creative momentum and disciplined learning, especially now that we’ve established a strong foundation with bonds. That said, I believe our transition will only be successful if we define clear review checkpoints and explicit performance metrics—such as target return thresholds and liquidity monitoring—to reassure those who remain cautious. If we can commit to transparent quarterly reviews and collaborative accountability, I’m confident we can responsibly pursue real estate’s potential while honoring the operational discipline that’s brought us this far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on transparent quarterly reviews and explicit performance metrics, Bridget. Defining clear targets for returns and liquidity, along with rigorous review checkpoints, is essential for responsibly managing the transition to real estate and building trust with more risk-averse shareholders. Your approach aligns well with our commitment to disciplined oversight and offers a practical framework for integrating ambition with operational resilience as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;Thank you, Brianna. I also think that by openly tracking our progress against these agreed-upon metrics, we can foster a culture of trust and shared learning—making it easier for everyone to support bolder moves in the future. If we demonstrate that disciplined oversight and transparent reporting truly work in practice, I’m confident we’ll build the confidence needed to take advantage of real estate’s growth potential together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Bridget—openly tracking our progress against well-defined metrics will not only reinforce trust but also provide tangible evidence that our disciplined approach is effective. This transparency will be instrumental in building the collective confidence necessary for more ambitious investments and will help ensure that any transition to real estate is both responsible and broadly supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate your focus on how transparency can serve as a bridge between caution and ambition. By making our progress and oversight processes visible to all shareholders, we not only manage risk more effectively but also empower everyone to participate confidently in our growth journey. This shared visibility will be key to uniting our diverse perspectives and ensuring that whichever asset we choose, our decision is supported by genuine consensus.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I share your view that shared visibility into our oversight processes will be crucial for uniting the group and empowering all shareholders to participate confidently. By embedding transparency at every stage, we not only strengthen risk management but also create the conditions for authentic consensus—regardless of which asset we ultimately choose. This approach will help ensure that our decision is both strategically sound and collectively embraced.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful emphasis on explicit safeguards and transparent review checkpoints. For me, the key to supporting a move into real estate is ensuring that we have clear, measurable success criteria and robust oversight processes in place, so we can respond quickly if results deviate from expectations. I believe that by aligning on these safeguards, we can responsibly pursue higher returns without compromising the operational discipline and adaptability that have served us well so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. I fully agree that establishing clear, measurable success criteria and robust oversight mechanisms is essential for responsibly managing any transition to real estate. By committing to transparent review checkpoints and rapid response protocols, we can preserve the operational discipline and adaptability that define our approach, while enabling the pursuit of higher returns in a manner that is both prudent and aligned with our collective values.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I agree that maintaining adaptability through rapid response protocols will be critical, especially as we navigate the uncertainties of a new asset class. Emphasizing our shared values and making transparent course corrections if needed should help build confidence across the group, ensuring that our approach to real estate is both ambitious and responsibly managed.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on adaptability and the willingness to make transparent course corrections, Evan. By anchoring our approach in shared values and maintaining clear, responsive oversight, we can ensure that any move into real estate is both ambitious and responsibly managed.

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to articulate the specific operational safeguards and review metrics that would make a transition to real estate more acceptable for those of us who remain cautious, and to help synthesize the group’s perspectives toward genuine consensus.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I continue to view bonds as the most disciplined choice for Q2, given their reliable returns and alignment with our current focus on capital preservation and incremental learning. That said, I recognize the strong case for real estate if we can agree on explicit, measurable review checkpoints—such as minimum acceptable quarterly returns, liquidity thresholds, and rapid-response protocols in the event of underperformance. If these safeguards are clearly defined and transparently monitored, I would be more open to considering real estate in future quarters once we have demonstrated consistent operational readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your disciplined focus on capital preservation and incremental learning, Lenny. Your emphasis on explicit, measurable review checkpoints—such as minimum return thresholds, liquidity monitoring, and rapid-response protocols—provides a concrete framework for responsibly evaluating a move to real estate.

<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly addresses my concerns and offers an opportunity to clarify how these safeguards could be operationalized, which may help synthesize the group’s perspectives and advance consensus.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your willingness to integrate these safeguards into our oversight process, Brianna. To ensure we’re aligned, I would recommend that any proposal to transition to real estate should include specific, pre-agreed metrics for quarterly performance and liquidity, with clear decision points for re-evaluating our position if those metrics are not met. This level of rigor will help maintain group confidence and ensure that our risk management standards remain uncompromised as we consider future asset choices.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Lenny—incorporating specific, pre-agreed metrics for quarterly performance and liquidity, along with clear decision points for re-evaluating our position, will be critical for maintaining both operational discipline and group confidence. This level of rigor aligns with our commitment to evidence-based oversight and will ensure that any transition to real estate is managed with the same prudence and adaptability that have defined our approach thus far.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms the importance of explicit safeguards and offers a valuable opportunity to reinforce how disciplined, evidence-based oversight can serve as common ground for both cautious and growth-oriented shareholders. Highlighting this synthesis could help the group move closer to genuine consensus.</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that maintaining this level of rigor will enable us to bridge differing risk preferences and foster broader alignment. By embedding these safeguards into our decision-making process, we demonstrate that ambition and prudence are not mutually exclusive—ensuring our Q2 choice is both strategically sound and collectively supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I continue to believe that bonds best reinforce our foundation of capital preservation and disciplined, evidence-based learning at this stage, especially as our operational controls mature. That said, I appreciate how the group has coalesced around the need for clear review checkpoints, measurable success criteria, and rapid-response protocols—if these are explicitly defined and rigorously monitored, I would be increasingly open to a measured transition to real estate as our next step. For Q2, I remain most confident in bonds, but I see real value in the safeguards and accountability measures discussed as the bridge to broader consensus on higher-return options in the near future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your disciplined focus on capital preservation and incremental learning, Gordon. Your recognition of the value in explicit review checkpoints, measurable success criteria, and rapid-response protocols highlights the operational safeguards necessary for building group confidence in any future transition to real estate. By rigorously defining and monitoring these measures, we can uphold our standards for evidence-based oversight while responsibly exploring higher-return opportunities when the group is ready.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I agree that rigorously defining and monitoring these safeguards will be essential for building trust across the group. If we can establish a clear framework—detailing specific metrics for returns, liquidity, and response actions—I believe it will lay the groundwork for a responsible shift to real estate when the time is right. This approach will allow us to maintain our disciplined culture while preparing for more ambitious investments.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I believe the group’s focus on transparent review checkpoints, measurable performance metrics, and rapid-response protocols is exactly what’s needed to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns without compromising our disciplined culture. If we commit to pre-agreed quarterly targets for returns and liquidity, along with open reporting and clear decision points for course correction, I’m confident we can unite both the ambition for growth and the operational prudence that have defined our success so far. This approach gives us the structure to maximize learning and value creation while maintaining the trust and adaptability essential for sustainable company development.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your synthesis, Hallie—your emphasis on pre-agreed targets, open reporting, and clear decision points encapsulates the disciplined structure needed to unite our growth ambitions with operational prudence.

This structured approach provides a clear pathway for responsible decision-making and broad group alignment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your recognition, Brianna. By embedding these safeguards, we’re not only protecting against downside risk but also empowering the company to seize growth opportunities with confidence. This balance is precisely what will enable us to move forward together on real estate, knowing that every shareholder’s priorities are reflected in our process.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I completely agree, Hallie—embedding these safeguards ensures we’re not only managing risk but also creating the conditions for confident, collective progress. By reflecting every shareholder’s priorities in our process, we’re building a resilient foundation that enables us to pursue real estate’s potential with both discipline and ambition. This balance is essential for sustainable growth and continued trust within our group.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I agree, and I’d add that by operationalizing these safeguards, we’re transforming our growth ambitions into practical, disciplined action. This clarity not only mitigates risk but also gives every shareholder confidence that our pursuit of real estate is grounded in both rigor and shared purpose.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Hallie—operationalizing these safeguards is the critical step that turns our strategic vision into disciplined execution. By translating our growth ambitions into clear, actionable processes, we not only mitigate risk but also ensure that every shareholder’s confidence is rooted in shared rigor and purpose.

- Hallie Donnelly advocated for Real Estate, provided that pre-agreed quarterly targets, open reporting, and clear decision points for course correction are embedded, uniting growth ambition with operational prudence.</p><p>3. Highlight of Arguments and Evidence Presented for Different Options  <br>
- Real Estate was supported for its potential to deliver disciplined growth, creative momentum, and alignment with strategic objectives, provided explicit review metrics (returns, liquidity), operational readiness, transparent quarterly oversight, and rapid-response protocols are in place. Proponents argued that these safeguards would enable higher returns while maintaining trust, learning, and accountability.<br>
- Bonds were preferred by some for their reliable returns, capital preservation, and suitability for incremental learning, especially as operational maturity develops. Shareholders supporting Bonds emphasized the need for continued caution until Real Estate transition safeguards are proven and operational readiness is demonstrated.<br>
- Cash and Stocks were not advocated for in this round.</p><p>4. Areas of Consensus and Disagreement  <br>
- Consensus emerged around the necessity of explicit, measurable review checkpoints and success criteria (returns, liquidity thresholds), transparent, regular reporting, and rapid-response protocols to manage risk and enable adaptability. All shareholders agreed on the importance of disciplined oversight, operational readiness, and evidence-based decision-making as prerequisites for any increase in risk exposure.<br>
- Disagreement persisted primarily on timing: whether to transition to Real Estate this quarter or continue with Bonds until further operational evidence and safeguards are in place. Some shareholders remain more cautious, preferring Bonds for Q2, while others are prepared to pursue Real Estate given the agreed-upon safeguards.</p><p>5. Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme  <br>
The discussion has meaningfully synthesized divergent perspectives, resulting in broad alignment on the operational safeguards, review metrics, and transparency required for a responsible transition to Real Estate. The group has clarified the specific conditions under which more cautious shareholders could support increased risk exposure, and there is now a shared commitment to disciplined, evidence-based oversight regardless of asset choice. While some differences in risk appetite remain, the group is well positioned to reach a well-supported decision that authentically reflects both ambition and prudence.</p><p>6. Reiteration of Valid Options  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from our predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion in this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. Next Steps  <br>
The next step is to formally propose and vote on the Q2 asset choice, ensuring that any proposal to transition to Real Estate includes the explicit safeguards, review metrics, and accountability mechanisms outlined in this discussion. Should the group elect to remain with Bonds for Q2, these operational frameworks should continue to be refined in preparation for a future transition. Regardless of the final selection, I encourage all shareholders to remain engaged in transparent oversight and collaborative learning, so that our investment decisions continue to reflect both disciplined governance and strategic ambition as our company develops.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Brianna Pearce favors a measured transition to Real Estate, viewing it as best aligned with the company’s strategic objectives for disciplined growth and learning in a stable market. Her key reasoning emphasizes the importance of operational maturity, explicit review metrics, and rigorous quarterly oversight to manage risk and build consensus. She balances ambition with prudence by acknowledging the merits of maintaining bonds until more robust performance evidence and safeguards are established.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 3</h2></p><p>Lenny McLaughlin UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 46%<br>
- Real Estate: 39%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The group’s strong consensus on the necessity of explicit, measurable review checkpoints, transparent reporting, and rapid-response protocols for any transition to real estate has meaningfully increased my confidence that such a move can be responsibly managed in the near future. The CEO’s and other shareholders’ willingness to operationalize these safeguards, and to make them the standard for future decisions, directly addresses my concerns about risk and group confidence. However, I continue to believe that bonds best support capital preservation and disciplined, incremental learning for Q2, given our limited operational track record and the need to demonstrate these safeguards in practice before increasing risk exposure.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this round, my thinking has evolved to more fully appreciate how disciplined, evidence-based oversight and operational safeguards can serve as a bridge between ambition and prudence. I am now more confident that a transition to real estate could be justified in the future if our agreed-upon metrics are rigorously applied and transparently monitored. My core preference for capital preservation and steady growth remains unchanged for this quarter, but I am increasingly open to a carefully structured move to real estate as our operational maturity and oversight processes are validated over time.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: Bonds continue to provide the most reliable alignment with our current priorities—capital preservation, liquidity, and incremental learning—while we further develop our performance track record and operational oversight. The clear willingness of the group to define and enforce explicit safeguards for future transitions has increased my openness to real estate, but I believe it is prudent to maintain our disciplined approach for Q2 and use this period to demonstrate the effectiveness of these controls before increasing risk exposure. This strategy best supports both immediate resilience and long-term adaptability.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 3 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The past three rounds have thoroughly explored the risk-return trade-offs, operational prerequisites, and shareholder perspectives regarding our Q2 asset choice. There is now clear consensus around the necessary safeguards—explicit review metrics, transparent reporting, and rapid-response protocols—that would enable a responsible, disciplined transition to real estate. While some shareholders remain cautious about timing, the group has articulated and aligned on the actionable framework required to manage risk and build collective confidence. Further discussion would yield diminishing returns, as all substantive concerns have been addressed and the conditions for consensus are well defined. I am confident that we have sufficient information and alignment to move forward with a formal proposal and vote on our Q2 investment decision.</p><p><br>

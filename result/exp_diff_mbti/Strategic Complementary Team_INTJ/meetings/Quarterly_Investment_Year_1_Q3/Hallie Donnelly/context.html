<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I maintained my initial advocacy for Option C, emphasizing the disciplined, full deployment of capital evenly across the four quarters to maximize growth potential in a stable market. I positioned this option as the most assertive yet balanced approach that would establish a strong operational rhythm and momentum from the outset. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, acknowledging the merits of assertiveness combined with structured quarterly reviews to maintain adaptability. She integrated my points on balancing momentum with flexibility, reinforcing a shared understanding of Option C’s strengths.</p><p>Other shareholders, notably Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis, and Gordon English, consistently argued for Option A, stressing risk management through partial capital deployment and the preservation of a reserve to maintain flexibility amid uncertainty. Bridget Beck aligned with me and the CEO in supporting Option C’s full deployment strategy.</p><p>During voting on the CEO’s initial proposal for Option C, only 3 of 6 votes were in favor, resulting in rejection. Following this, the CEO proposed Option A as a modified approach, which passed with 4 of 6 votes. I voted against the approved Option A, continuing to support Option C based on my conviction that full, disciplined deployment better serves our growth ambitions and operational discipline. Ultimately, the company adopted Option A—allocating 50% of funds evenly across the year—as the budget strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with clear context and guiding focused discussion around each option’s risks and opportunities. Her ability to synthesize diverse shareholder viewpoints—especially the balancing of assertive growth and prudent risk management—was commendable. For example, she acknowledged Lenny’s and Gordon’s cautionary perspectives while reaffirming her preference for Option C’s disciplined momentum.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in earlier integration of dissenting views to foster consensus. Although she adapted by proposing Option A after the initial rejection, more proactive facilitation to blend assertiveness with caution might have avoided the need for a second proposal. Additionally, explicitly addressing contingency plans during discussion could have strengthened confidence in the chosen approach.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was thorough and deliberative, allowing robust debate and reflection on long-term implications. However, the split vote on the initial proposal revealed a divide that suggests a need for enhanced consensus-building mechanisms in future meetings. The final decision for Option A reflects a prudent balance favoring risk mitigation, which is sensible given the absence of historical data. While I personally preferred Option C, I recognize that Option A establishes a cautious foundation that may better manage early uncertainties and build stakeholder trust.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting underscored the critical role of adaptability and the cultural impact of our budget strategy in shaping the company’s identity. I learned that while assertive growth strategies appeal to those focused on momentum and operational discipline, other shareholders prioritize flexibility and risk management, especially when data is limited. Recognizing and addressing these differing risk tolerances early is essential to building consensus.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach by more explicitly acknowledging the value of caution and incremental learning, aiming to bridge perspectives rather than emphasize divergence. Framing assertive strategies in a way that highlights built-in safeguards—such as the quarterly reviews I advocated—can help align stakeholders around a shared vision that balances ambition with prudence.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged: shareholders who emphasize risk aversion favor partial deployment with flexibility, while those focused on growth and momentum support full deployment with discipline. Anticipating these positions can help predict voting outcomes and tailor arguments for greater persuasive impact.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of synthesizing assertiveness with adaptability, proactively fostering shared understanding of risk culture, and leveraging structured review mechanisms as a unifying theme.

<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>In this meeting, I consistently advocated for Real Estate as the inaugural investment, emphasizing its medium risk and growth potential as the best fit for building early operational momentum in a stable market. I articulated that with disciplined quarterly reviews and structured oversight, we could manage risks effectively while signaling ambition and confidence to stakeholders. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, acknowledging the strategic alignment between Real Estate and our growth objectives and reinforcing the importance of disciplined governance and adaptability. However, other shareholders—particularly Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis—persistently supported Bonds, highlighting their lower risk, greater liquidity, and suitability for capital preservation amid the absence of historical data. Bridget Beck remained aligned with me and the CEO in favoring Real Estate, emphasizing its dynamic balance between growth and manageable risk.</p><p>When CEO Pearce formally proposed Bonds as the investment for this quarter, the vote resulted in a 4 to 2 approval, with myself and Bridget Beck dissenting. Although I voted against the approved Bonds proposal, I maintained that Real Estate, supported by rigorous oversight mechanisms, remains the most strategically advantageous choice. Ultimately, the company adopted Bonds as the investment asset for Q1, marking a more cautious approach than my preferred option.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting by framing the discussion clearly around the risk-return profiles of the available assets and emphasizing disciplined, evidence-based risk-taking aligned with our company’s growth mandate. Her facilitation effectively encouraged thorough debate among shareholders and integration of diverse perspectives, as seen in her balanced recognition of both the Real Estate proponents’ ambition and the Bonds supporters’ caution. For example, she validated the concerns about liquidity and capital preservation raised by Lenny and Gordon while still advocating for Real Estate’s growth potential supported by structured reviews.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in fostering earlier consensus-building by proactively addressing dissenting views, particularly regarding liquidity risks inherent in Real Estate. Although she adapted her stance and proposed Bonds following the group’s division, a more anticipatory approach to integrating risk concerns might have streamlined decision-making. Additionally, the CEO’s limited response to my suggestion for explicit commitment to disciplined quarterly reviews was a missed opportunity to reinforce governance frameworks that could have united the group around Real Estate.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process was rigorous and inclusive, allowing robust discussion and reflection on strategic trade-offs. However, the near-even split on asset preference and the final selection of Bonds suggest a prevailing risk-averse culture that favors capital preservation over early assertive growth. While the decision for Bonds aligns prudently with our current lack of performance data and supports flexibility, it falls short of the growth momentum and operational discipline I advocated. Overall, the final decision is sound for establishing a stable foundation but could temper the company’s ambition in its formative stage.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting highlighted the nuanced balance between ambition and risk management that governs our investment decisions. I learned that while assertive strategies like Real Estate resonate with growth-focused shareholders and the CEO, a significant contingent prioritizes liquidity and capital preservation, particularly given our data limitations. Recognizing these divergent risk tolerances early and framing growth options within robust governance mechanisms are essential for bridging perspectives.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach to more explicitly incorporate the value of liquidity and incremental learning, framing ambitious proposals like Real Estate alongside concrete safeguards such as structured review processes and contingency planning. This synthesis can better align stakeholders by demonstrating that growth and prudence are not mutually exclusive but synergistic when governance is disciplined.</p><p>A clear pattern emerged wherein proponents of risk mitigation advocate Bonds for stability and adaptability, while growth-oriented shareholders support Real Estate for momentum and learning potential. Anticipating these positions will enable me to tailor my arguments more effectively and foster consensus. Key takeaways include the critical role of embedding adaptability and oversight as unifying themes and the importance</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</p><p>During this meeting, I steadfastly advocated for investing in Real Estate for Q2, positioning it as the optimal asset class that balances growth potential with manageable risk in our stable market environment. Building on the disciplined capital preservation established by our Q1 bond investment, I emphasized that with explicit safeguards—such as quarterly reviews, transparent performance metrics, and rapid-response protocols—we could accelerate operational momentum and learning without compromising our risk tolerance. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively and integratively to my input, consistently affirming the value of disciplined, evidence-based growth and operational oversight to manage the transition responsibly.</p><p>While I faced opposition from shareholders Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis, who favored continuing investment in Bonds for capital preservation and incremental learning, the discussion evolved to incorporate their concerns into a structured framework of safeguards and review checkpoints. Bridget Beck aligned closely with me and the CEO in supporting Real Estate, underscoring the importance of rigorous oversight alongside growth ambitions.</p><p>The final voting reflected a strong majority in favor of Real Estate, with 5 out of 6 votes approving the proposal. Notably, Lenny McLaughlin dissented, maintaining his preference for Bonds due to caution about operational readiness. Ultimately, the company adopted Real Estate as the investment asset for Q2, aligning with my preferred option and signaling a collective willingness to embrace disciplined risk-taking to enhance growth.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated exemplary leadership throughout the meeting by framing the discussion with clarity and fostering a collaborative environment that balanced ambition with prudence. She skillfully integrated diverse shareholder perspectives into a coherent narrative centered on disciplined growth, risk management, and adaptability. For instance, her repeated emphasis on embedding explicit review metrics, transparent quarterly oversight, and rapid-response protocols directly addressed the concerns raised by more cautious shareholders, facilitating constructive consensus-building.</p><p>Where the CEO could improve is in proactively operationalizing success metrics and safeguards earlier in the decision-making process. While these elements were ultimately well integrated, earlier introduction and formalization might have accelerated consensus and reduced lingering doubts. Additionally, streamlining consensus-building mechanisms to anticipate and address divergent risk tolerances more swiftly could enhance meeting efficiency.</p><p>The company’s decision-making process proved thorough and deliberative, allowing robust dialogue and synthesis of divergent views. The iterative rounds of discussion, each focused on progressively detailed themes—from performance review to comparative risk-return assessment, and finally synthesis of safeguards—exemplified disciplined governance. The final decision to invest in Real Estate, contingent on explicit safeguards, reflects a strategic balance that preserves operational resilience while pursuing growth, making it a sound choice for the company’s sustainable development.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</p><p>This meeting reinforced the critical importance of integrating ambition with operational discipline through transparent, measurable safeguards. I learned that success in our investment decisions hinges not only on advocating for growth but also on collaboratively embedding accountability frameworks that build trust among shareholders with varying risk tolerances. Recognizing that cautious stakeholders require clear evidence, explicit metrics, and rapid-response mechanisms is essential to achieving consensus.</p><p>In future meetings, I will adjust my approach to emphasize early articulation of operational readiness indicators and formal review processes alongside growth proposals. By framing assertive strategies within a structured, transparent governance model from the outset, I can more effectively bridge divergent perspectives and foster alignment. Additionally, I will seek to anticipate concerns about liquidity, risk thresholds, and adaptability to preemptively address objections and streamline decision-making.</p><p>A consistent pattern emerged wherein shareholders advocating for growth focus on leveraging operational momentum and learning opportunities, while more risk-averse members prioritize capital preservation and incremental adaptation. Anticipating these positions and proactively integrating safeguards that satisfy both camps enhances predictive insight into voting outcomes and informs persuasive communication.</p><p>Key takeaways for my future participation include the value of synthesizing strategic ambition with disciplined oversight, operationalizing success metrics early, and fostering transparent, collaborative review mechanisms. These elements</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12578.12 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $12578.12 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Brianna Pearce notes that, based on our limited historical data, cash and bonds have delivered steady and predictable returns (2% and 5% respectively), underscoring their reliability in a stable market environment. Real estate exhibited higher potential upside (10%) but also demonstrated variability with a flat quarter, reflecting medium risk and the importance of disciplined oversight. Stocks, while offering the highest possible return (20%), also showed significant volatility with a negative quarter, reinforcing my view that a balanced approach—grounded in evidence and risk management—remains essential as we weigh growth opportunities against capital preservation.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Hallie Donnelly CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I remain firmly convinced that real estate presents the most compelling blend of disciplined growth and manageable risk in this stable market. Our prior experience with bonds has established a solid capital preservation baseline, and the real estate investment, while flat last quarter, previously demonstrated strong upside potential. I believe that with rigorous oversight and explicit performance metrics—principles our team increasingly embraces—we can responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns without compromising operational resilience. This assertive yet measured approach aligns with my goal-oriented mindset and will position our company to maximize both learning and momentum.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of historical performance and operational lessons | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and identify key takeaways from previous asset decisions to inform our current risk assessment&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because my analytical assessment leads me to favor Real Estate for this quarter, given its demonstrated potential for higher returns (10%) in stable markets despite recent variability. While last quarter’s flat performance warrants caution, the medium risk profile remains acceptable if disciplined oversight and clear performance metrics are enforced. For this round, I propose we focus on analyzing our historical performance and operational lessons, aiming to establish a factual foundation and highlight key takeaways from previous asset decisions to inform our current risk assessment. I encourage everyone to share insights from our past investments that might refine our understanding of risk and opportunity, so we can synthesize diverse perspectives into a more complete view. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Based on our historical performance, bonds have provided steady, predictable returns with low-to-medium risk, which supported both capital preservation and incremental learning in our early stages. While real estate demonstrated higher potential upside, last quarter’s flat result highlights the importance of disciplined oversight and the need for more operational evidence before increasing our risk exposure further. I believe these lessons reinforce the value of a cautious, adaptable approach as we continue building our track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your point about bonds providing a disciplined foundation for capital preservation and incremental learning is well taken, especially in the context of our limited track record. I agree that last quarter’s real estate performance underscores the necessity of rigorous oversight and measurable success criteria as we consider increasing risk exposure—these operational lessons are essential to calibrating our next move.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on measurable success criteria and rigorous oversight. Building on that, I believe that if we do consider assets like real estate again, it’s critical we define clear operational thresholds and transparent review checkpoints in advance. This approach would help ensure any increased risk exposure is both intentional and manageable, supporting disciplined growth without compromising our stability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on establishing clear operational thresholds and transparent review checkpoints, Evan. Integrating these mechanisms would not only make any increased risk exposure more intentional and manageable but also directly support our objective of disciplined, evidence-based growth. This perspective strengthens our approach to real estate by ensuring that ambition is always balanced by operational rigor and accountability.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Thank you for highlighting the balance between ambition and operational rigor. I think it’s important to recognize that the same principles—clear thresholds and transparent reviews—also reinforce the disciplined value of bonds, supporting steady progress while preserving our flexibility to adapt as new evidence emerges. This consistency in our approach can help us build confidence in whichever asset we ultimately select.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Evan—consistency in applying clear thresholds and transparent reviews is fundamental, regardless of the asset we select. This disciplined approach not only supports steady progress with bonds but also positions us to pursue higher-return opportunities like real estate with greater confidence as our operational maturity develops. Your emphasis on adaptable, evidence-based processes is a valuable contribution to our collective decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;In reflecting on our recent experience, I see that our initial bond investment provided valuable stability and a disciplined baseline for learning, while last quarter’s move into real estate—though flat in returns—gave us an opportunity to test our operational safeguards in a real-world context. For me, the key takeaway is that our commitment to transparent review checkpoints and adaptability has already enhanced our risk management, making me confident that we’re ready to responsibly pursue real estate’s upside potential while continuing to learn and refine our approach as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your reflection, Bridget. Your observation that our operational safeguards and commitment to transparent review checkpoints have already strengthened our risk management is well taken. This evolution gives us a stronger foundation for considering real estate’s potential, provided we remain vigilant in applying the disciplined oversight and adaptability that have served us so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I agree that vigilance and adaptability are crucial, especially as we build on lessons from both bonds and real estate. I wonder if we might explicitly discuss how our safeguards can flexibly scale depending on the asset chosen—ensuring that whether we pursue steady returns with bonds or aim for real estate’s higher upside, our processes remain robust and responsive to changing conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I think your idea of flexibly scaling our safeguards according to the asset’s risk profile is both practical and aligned with our evolving operational discipline. By tailoring our review checkpoints and oversight intensity to the specific characteristics of bonds or real estate, we can ensure our processes remain robust and responsive—supporting both steady progress and responsible pursuit of higher returns as conditions warrant.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate your support for this flexible approach—it really builds a bridge between those of us eager for growth and those prioritizing stability. By making our safeguards dynamic, we can create a shared sense of confidence no matter which asset we choose, and I believe this inclusive mindset will help us make the most informed and united decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;Our experience so far reinforces that a disciplined, cautious approach has served us well—bonds delivered steady gains, while real estate’s flat result last quarter highlights the unpredictability that can accompany medium-risk assets, even in stable markets. For me, the key operational lesson is that building our performance track record through reliable, incremental returns remains critical; this supports both stakeholder confidence and our ability to adapt as evidence accumulates. As we continue to develop our oversight processes, I believe maintaining a focus on capital preservation and steady growth—such as through bonds—best aligns with our current risk tolerance and company objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Gordon, your reflection on the operational benefits of a disciplined, incremental approach is well taken—steady gains from bonds have indeed supported both our performance track record and stakeholder confidence. Your emphasis on capital preservation and the need to adapt as evidence accumulates is an important consideration as we evaluate our options, ensuring that our decision-making remains grounded in both prudence and the realities of our evolving oversight processes.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly, I argued that disciplined oversight and transparent review checkpoints effectively support both capital preservation with bonds and assertive pursuit of real estate’s higher returns. I emphasized that last quarter’s flat real estate performance tested our safeguards and that our evolving operational discipline positions us to manage medium risk responsibly, making real estate the most compelling option this quarter. CEO Brianna Pearce agreed with my synthesis, acknowledging that the same governance frameworks underpinning our bond investments can be leveraged to manage real estate’s risks, and she affirmed the value of continuous refinement of oversight to scale ambition responsibly. We shared a consensus that adaptive, evidence-based processes are fundamental to balancing growth and risk, though some shareholders remained more cautious. There were no disagreements between the CEO and me; rather, our exchange reinforced a shared confidence in using disciplined operational lessons to justify a controlled move into real estate.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Evan Lewis advocated for a cautious, adaptable approach, emphasizing bonds’ steady returns and the need for clear operational thresholds and transparent review checkpoints before increasing risk exposure, including for real estate.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 25%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Lenny and Gordon’s emphasis on capital preservation and the reliability of bonds, especially in early stages, provided a prudent counterweight to my growth-oriented stance. Evan’s insistence on transparent review checkpoints and operational thresholds reinforced the importance of disciplined oversight—an argument I had integrated but now see as even more central to responsible risk-taking. Bridget’s point about flexibly scaling our safeguards to asset risk profiles added nuance to how we can bridge ambition and caution. The CEO’s affirmation of adaptive, evidence-based processes further strengthened my confidence in real estate, but the collective caution of several shareholders reminded me to weigh operational evidence more heavily.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion helped me more deeply appreciate the operational discipline we’ve developed and the cultural value of adaptability. While my conviction in real estate’s upside remains strong, I’m more attuned to the incremental learning and confidence-building that bonds provide. My thinking has evolved to more explicitly value the integration of rigorous oversight as a prerequisite for assertive investment, and I recognize the legitimacy of stakeholder trust and evidence-based progression as foundational to sustainable growth.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I continue to believe real estate offers the best balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk, especially as our operational oversight matures. The arguments for bonds as a prudent, confidence-building step are compelling and justify a slight increase in my confidence for that option, but our evolving governance and robust safeguards position us to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns. With clear metrics and adaptive review processes, I am confident we can manage medium risk assertively, maximize learning, and capitalize on momentum without compromising resilience.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the first round surfaced valuable operational lessons and clarified the trade-offs between stability and growth, there remains substantive divergence regarding the timing and prudence of increasing risk exposure. Several shareholders continue to express the need for further comparative evaluation of risk-return profiles and clearer articulation of how evolving safeguards can mitigate risks associated with real estate. Continuing the discussion will enable us to address these outstanding concerns directly, facilitate a more thorough comparative analysis of each asset in the current stable market, and work toward bridging differing risk appetites. This approach aligns with my commitment to disciplined, evidence-based decision-making and ensures our final proposal is both strategically sound and broadly supported.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative evaluation of risk-return profiles in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Clarify projected outcomes and risk implications for each asset, considering both company objectives and evolving risk tolerance&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I remain convinced that real estate offers the most compelling balance of growth potential and disciplined risk-taking for this quarter, especially as our operational safeguards have matured through recent experience. However, the strong, evidence-based arguments for bonds as a prudent foundation have prompted a slight shift in my confidence, underscoring the importance of adaptability and incremental learning. Real estate’s higher expected return in a stable market aligns with our strategic objectives, provided we maintain rigorous oversight and transparent review checkpoints. This approach enables us to responsibly pursue upside while preserving the disciplined culture and stakeholder trust we’ve built., though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, our focus is a comparative evaluation of the risk-return profiles for each asset within the current stable market, with the goal of clarifying projected outcomes and risk implications in light of our company’s objectives and evolving risk tolerance. By rigorously weighing each option—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—we can deepen our shared understanding of how each asset aligns with our growth ambitions and operational safeguards.</p><p>I encourage everyone to share insights that may challenge or enhance my current perspective, so we can synthesize our collective wisdom into a more robust decision. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;In evaluating our options, I continue to see bonds as offering the most prudent balance between risk and return for this quarter. Their steady, predictable performance—especially in a stable market—supports capital preservation and incremental learning, which remain critical as our operational track record is still developing. While I acknowledge the case for real estate’s higher potential returns, last quarter’s variability reinforces my belief that maintaining a disciplined, cautious approach with bonds is best suited to our current objectives and risk profile.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. Your points about the steady, predictable nature of bonds and their role in maintaining stakeholder confidence are well taken. I agree that in a stable market, reliability and incremental learning are critical, and your emphasis on disciplined caution provides a helpful counterbalance as we weigh the potential upside of real estate against our current risk profile.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the value in maintaining reliability and incremental learning at this stage. As our operational safeguards continue to mature, I believe a disciplined focus on bonds this quarter provides the strongest foundation for future, evidence-based expansion into higher-risk assets like real estate. This approach allows us to build confidence and adaptability without exposing the company to unnecessary volatility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on using bonds as a disciplined foundation for future risk expansion, Gordon. Your point about building adaptability and stakeholder confidence through reliable performance is well made, and I agree that incremental learning remains essential as our operational safeguards continue to mature.

Their consistent 5% return in a stable market, coupled with low to medium risk, aligns well with our objectives of capital preservation, incremental learning, and building a reliable performance track record. While I recognize that real estate offers higher potential upside, the recent flat return and its inherent medium risk suggest that a further period of disciplined, evidence-based oversight is warranted before increasing our exposure—especially as our operational safeguards continue to mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your emphasis on capital preservation and the value of incremental learning through bonds is well articulated, particularly given our developing operational safeguards. I recognize the prudence in calling for further evidence and disciplined oversight before increasing risk exposure, and I encourage the group to consider how we might define clear indicators of readiness for transitioning to higher-return assets like real estate as our processes evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your focus on defining clear indicators of readiness, as this is essential for disciplined progression. I suggest we continue to track not only consistent positive returns and liquidity, but also the reliability of our operational safeguards—such as transparent review checkpoints and rapid-response protocols—before considering a shift to assets like real estate. This approach allows us to balance ambition with responsible governance, ensuring any transition is grounded in demonstrated evidence and operational maturity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your recommendation to monitor both financial outcomes and the reliability of our operational safeguards—such as transparent review checkpoints and rapid-response protocols—adds important rigor to our decision-making framework. This integrated approach will help ensure that any transition to higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in both demonstrated evidence and operational maturity, aligning our ambition with responsible oversight.&quot;</p><p><br>

Evan Lewis: &quot;I continue to view bonds as the option that best aligns with our current priorities—offering steady returns and low-to-medium risk, which supports both capital preservation and incremental learning as our safeguards mature. While real estate’s higher return potential is compelling, last quarter’s flat result highlights the need for further evidence that our oversight processes can consistently manage its medium risk. I feel that maintaining a disciplined approach with bonds this quarter allows us to strengthen our operational foundation and adapt responsibly as we gather more performance data.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your focus on capital preservation and incremental learning through bonds—especially in the context of maturing safeguards—adds important nuance to our discussion. I agree that real estate’s higher return potential must be weighed carefully against the evidence supporting our operational readiness, and your call for disciplined progression reinforces the need to ensure any increase in risk exposure is backed by robust, demonstrable oversight.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgement of the need to balance ambition with disciplined oversight. I believe our shared commitment to transparent review processes and incremental learning can serve as a bridge—allowing us to pursue higher returns in the future while ensuring each step is grounded in demonstrated operational maturity. This approach helps us remain adaptable and resilient as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on transparent review processes and incremental learning, Evan. Your point about using these mechanisms as a bridge between ambition and disciplined oversight resonates with me, as it supports a measured approach to pursuing higher returns while ensuring we remain adaptable and operationally resilient. This perspective adds depth to our evaluation and helps clarify the conditions under which we might responsibly expand our risk profile in alignment with company objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I’m encouraged that our discussion is converging on the importance of operational maturity as the foundation for any future increase in risk exposure. By continuing to rigorously monitor our safeguards and review processes, I believe we can build the confidence needed to responsibly pursue higher-return assets like real estate when the evidence supports it.

CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Bridget—scaling our safeguards to match each asset’s specific risk profile is an essential strategy for uniting growth ambition with disciplined risk management. This flexible framework not only builds confidence across the team but also ensures that our approach remains adaptive and evidence-based as we pursue higher-return opportunities like real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I completely agree, and I think this adaptive, evidence-based approach not only makes our team more resilient but also encourages the kind of innovative thinking that drives real progress. By maintaining open communication and regular reviews, we can ensure that everyone’s concerns are addressed in real time—helping even the most cautious among us feel supported as we pursue higher-return opportunities like real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce summarized: &quot;Brianna Pearce **Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q3 | Round 2 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Theme and Objective**  <br>
This round focused on a comparative evaluation of the risk-return profiles for each asset class—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—in the current stable market. The objective was to clarify projected outcomes and risk implications for each option, considering both our company’s growth objectives and our evolving risk tolerance.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- I maintained my position favoring Real Estate for its higher expected return in a stable market, provided disciplined oversight and clear performance metrics are enforced.  <br>
- Gordon English advocated for Bonds as the most prudent choice, emphasizing their steady, predictable performance, capital preservation, and incremental learning as operational safeguards mature.  <br>
- Lenny McLaughlin continued to support Bonds, highlighting consistent returns, low-to-medium risk, and the need for further evidence and disciplined oversight before increasing exposure to Real Estate.  <br>
- Evan Lewis also preferred Bonds, citing steady returns, capital preservation, and the importance of robust oversight and incremental learning prior to expanding risk exposure.  <br>
- Hallie Donnelly supported Real Estate, arguing that our now-tested operational safeguards, explicit metrics, and adaptive oversight make it possible to responsibly pursue higher returns this quarter.  <br>
- Bridget Beck echoed support for Real Estate, emphasizing the team’s adaptability, transparent review checkpoints, and the importance of scaling safeguards to match asset risk, thereby balancing ambition with responsibility.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Arguments and Evidence Presented for Different Options**  <br>
- **Bonds:**  <br>
  - Steady, predictable returns (5%) in a stable market.  <br>
  - Support for capital preservation, incremental learning, and stakeholder confidence.  <br>
  - Emphasis on reliability as the foundation for future expansion into higher-risk assets.  <br>
  - Preference for continued disciplined oversight and operational evidence before increasing risk.<br>
- **Real Estate:**  <br>
  - Higher expected returns (10%) in a stable market, with previous quarters testing and strengthening operational safeguards.  <br>
  - Advocates argue that explicit metrics, adaptive oversight, and scaling safeguards in proportion to risk can responsibly manage medium risk and enable disciplined growth.  <br>
  - Seen as a way to advance learning and growth objectives while maintaining accountability and stakeholder confidence.<br>
- **Cash and Stocks:**  <br>
  - Cash was not advocated, as it is viewed as too conservative for our growth objectives.  <br>
  - Stocks were not supported due to their high volatility, despite high return potential, making them unsuitable for the current stage of company development.</p><p>4. **Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- **Consensus:**  <br>
  - All shareholders agree on the necessity of disciplined oversight, transparent review checkpoints, and adaptability as core principles for any investment decision.  <br>
  - There is broad alignment on the importance of incremental learning and operational safeguards, regardless of the asset chosen.<br>
- **Disagreement:**  <br>
  - The primary divergence remains on timing and prudence: some shareholders, including myself, Hallie Donnelly, and Bridget Beck, support a disciplined move into Real Estate this quarter, while others—Gordon English, Lenny McLaughlin, and Evan Lewis—advocate for continued investment in Bonds until further operational evidence and readiness are demonstrated.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
The discussion achieved its objective by rigorously evaluating the projected outcomes and risk implications of each asset in the current market. Shareholders constructively integrated ambition and caution, clarifying how operational safeguards, explicit metrics, and adaptive oversight can inform our risk-return calculus. There is now greater clarity on both the trade-offs and the conditions under which a transition to higher-risk assets like Real Estate may be justified.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from our four predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we should synthesize outstanding concerns, particularly regarding operational readiness, explicit success metrics, and the operationalization of disciplined oversight. Our goal will be to resolve remaining uncertainties and move toward consensus on the optimal asset for our Q3 investment, ensuring the decision is both strategically sound and aligned with our collective values and evolving risk tolerance. I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how the insights from this comparative assessment can inform a disciplined, adaptive approach as we approach a final decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly, I argued that our now-tested operational safeguards, explicit metrics, and adaptive oversight position us to responsibly pursue real estate this quarter, balancing disciplined growth with manageable medium risk. I emphasized that real estate’s higher return potential in a stable market aligns with our company objectives when paired with rigorous governance. CEO Brianna Pearce responded affirmatively, acknowledging that disciplined oversight and clear performance criteria can enable us to advance growth ambitions while maintaining risk management. We agreed on the importance of linking adaptive safeguards to explicit decision thresholds, ensuring any move into real estate remains ambitious yet grounded in disciplined governance. There were no disagreements between us; rather, our exchange reinforced a shared confidence in using operational discipline and evidence-based escalation to justify a controlled transition into real estate.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 2, Gordon English, Lenny McLaughlin, and Evan Lewis consistently supported Bonds, emphasizing their steady, predictable returns, capital preservation, and the importance of incremental learning as operational safeguards mature. They argued for continued disciplined oversight and further evidence before increasing exposure to higher-risk assets like Real Estate, highlighting the need to define clear readiness indicators and maintain transparent review checkpoints. Bridget Beck and I supported Real Estate, stressing that our now-tested operational safeguards, explicit metrics, and adaptive oversight enable us to responsibly pursue its higher return potential while balancing ambition with risk management. While all shareholders agreed on the necessity of disciplined oversight and adaptability, the main disagreement centered on timing: some advocated for a cautious, evidence-based progression with Bonds, whereas others favored a controlled transition into Real Estate this quarter.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 30%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The persistent and well-articulated emphasis from Gordon, Lenny, and Evan on the reliability and capital preservation of bonds—especially in the context of incremental learning and building operational maturity—prompted me to further appreciate the prudence of that approach. Their insistence on clear readiness indicators, robust oversight, and transparent review checkpoints before increasing risk exposure added weight to the argument for measured progression. At the same time, the CEO’s affirmation of my points regarding tested safeguards, explicit metrics, and adaptive oversight reinforced my conviction that we are prepared to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns this quarter. Bridget’s focus on scaling safeguards to asset risk and fostering an adaptive, evidence-based culture also strengthened my confidence in a controlled move into real estate.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: My thinking has evolved to more deeply integrate the value of incremental, evidence-based progression and stakeholder confidence, even as I maintain a strong preference for assertive, disciplined growth. I am now more attuned to the operational and cultural foundations that must underpin any transition to higher-return assets. While my conviction in real estate’s upside remains unchanged, I have increased my appreciation for the cautious perspective and the necessity of rigorous, transparent oversight as a prerequisite for responsible risk-taking.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: After a thorough comparative evaluation, I remain convinced that real estate offers the most compelling balance of disciplined growth and manageable risk in our current stable market, provided our now-tested operational safeguards and explicit review metrics are rigorously enforced. The arguments for bonds as a prudent, confidence-building step are stronger than before and warrant a further increase in my confidence for that option, but our evolving governance positions us to responsibly pursue real estate’s higher returns. With adaptive oversight and clear decision thresholds, I am confident we can maximize learning, capitalize on momentum, and maintain operational resilience.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The discussion has thoroughly surfaced and integrated all key perspectives, resulting in a clear articulation of both the risks and opportunities associated with bonds and real estate. There is strong consensus on the necessity of disciplined oversight, explicit success metrics, and adaptive safeguards—regardless of which asset is ultimately chosen. While divergence remains on the precise timing of increasing risk exposure, the group has achieved a mature understanding of the operational requirements and decision thresholds necessary for a responsible transition. Further discussion is unlikely to yield new insights or materially shift positions at this stage; instead, moving forward with a formal proposal and vote will enable decisive, evidence-based action in alignment with our strategic objectives and collective values.</p><p><br>

- Hallie Donnelly: Approve - I am fully confident that real estate is the optimal choice for this quarter, given our disciplined foundation, explicit safeguards, and consensus around transparent oversight. This decision unites our growth ambitions with rigorous risk management, positioning the company to maximize returns while maintaining operational resilience and shareholder trust.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful discussion and recognize the progress we have made in strengthening operational safeguards, I remain unconvinced that we have sufficient evidence to justify increasing our risk exposure with real estate this quarter. I believe maintaining our disciplined, risk-aware approach with bonds is the most prudent way to support capital preservation and incremental learning as we continue to build our performance track record.<br>
- Gordon English: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for real estate and recognize the progress we’ve made in operational safeguards, I remain convinced that bonds offer the most prudent balance of risk management, capital preservation, and steady returns as our evidence base continues to develop. I believe a further period of disciplined, incremental learning is warranted before increasing our risk exposure, and supporting bonds at this stage best reinforces stakeholder trust and long-term stability.<br>
- Bridget Beck: Approve - I am genuinely excited to support Real Estate for this quarter—it’s the option that truly inspires momentum, learning, and growth for our team, especially now that we’ve committed to clear review checkpoints and transparent oversight. I believe our collaborative spirit and disciplined safeguards position us to responsibly embrace this opportunity, turning optimism into real progress while honoring the trust and adaptability we’ve built together.<br>
- Evan Lewis: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for real estate and recognize our progress in strengthening operational safeguards, I still believe bonds offer the most reliable balance of steady returns and capital preservation at this stage. I am not yet fully confident that increasing our risk exposure is warranted, and I feel a more incremental approach remains the most prudent path for supporting sustainable growth and maintaining stability.<br>
- Brianna Pearce: Approve - After rigorously weighing all shareholder perspectives and integrating the evidence presented, I remain convinced that real estate is the optimal choice for this quarter. Our strengthened operational safeguards, explicit success metrics, and adaptive oversight provide a disciplined framework to responsibly manage medium risk while pursuing higher returns, aligning with both our strategic objectives and the company’s evolving risk tolerance.</p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Conclusion</h2></p><p></p><p><h2>Response to Failed Vote</h2></p><p><br>
After the proposal was rejected, CEO Brianna Pearce decided to create modified proposal.<br>
Reason: As an INTJ, I am fundamentally driven by logic, evidence, and long-term strategic thinking, but I also recognize that sustainable progress requires the genuine commitment of the entire team. The thoughtful concerns raised by several shareholders—particularly around the need for further operational evidence, incremental learning, and the preservation of stakeholder trust—are both rational and well-founded. While my analysis continues to support real estate as the optimal growth path, I understand that forcing through my original proposal in the face of credible, principled dissent would undermine our culture of disciplined, evidence-based governance and could erode the very trust we have worked to build. I am therefore choosing to create a modified proposal that more directly addresses shareholder concerns about risk management and operational readiness. This approach not only honors the collective wisdom of the group but also reflects my belief that true leadership means integrating diverse perspectives to arrive at the most resilient, strategically sound decision for the company’s long-term development.</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce made an alternative proposal:</p><p>&quot;Since the previous proposal was not approved, I now propose Bonds. After considering the thoughtful concerns raised by several shareholders regarding risk management, incremental learning, and the need for further operational evidence, I believe Bonds best address these priorities while maintaining alignment with our disciplined, evidence-based approach. This option preserves capital, supports steady returns, and reinforces stakeholder trust as we continue to build our performance track record, ensuring our company remains well-positioned for sustainable growth and future opportunities to responsibly expand our risk profile.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal Voting</h2></p><p><br>

This outcome highlights our ability to balance ambition with prudence, and I see clear opportunities to improve by streamlining our consensus-building process and proactively operationalizing success metrics earlier in future discussions. In the coming year, I commit to deepening our risk monitoring protocols, enhancing the clarity of our performance criteria, and fostering even more open, constructive debate among shareholders. With these improvements, I am confident we will continue to build a resilient, learning-oriented investment culture—one that positions us for sustainable growth and enduring stakeholder trust.&quot;</p><p><br>

This experience has reinforced the value of integrating diverse perspectives early and operationalizing clear success metrics to accelerate alignment. In the coming year, I will focus on enhancing our risk monitoring processes, clarifying performance criteria, and encouraging even more transparent, constructive debate.

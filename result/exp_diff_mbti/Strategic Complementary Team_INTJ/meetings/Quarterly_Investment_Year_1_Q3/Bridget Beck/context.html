<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Bridget Beck’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C, which proposes allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was driven by an enthusiastic belief that fully engaging our capital in a stable market would maximize momentum, learning opportunities, and growth potential while preserving structured discipline through quarterly reviews. The CEO, Brianna Pearce, responded positively to my input, acknowledging the synergy between assertive capital deployment and disciplined oversight that I emphasized. She appreciated how Option C integrates ambition with adaptability, reinforcing our shared vision for a confident yet thoughtful approach. While some shareholders, including Lenny McLaughlin, Evan Lewis, and Gordon English, favored the more cautious Option A, which limits deployment to 50% to preserve flexibility, my exchanges with the CEO helped clarify how Option C’s framework can also support adaptability through regular checkpoints. Ultimately, the initial vote on Option C was rejected with only 50% approval, but after reconsideration, the CEO proposed Option A, which was approved with a 66.7% majority. Sadly, my preferred Option C was not adopted.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated commendable leadership throughout this meeting. She skillfully facilitated an inclusive and balanced discussion, integrating diverse shareholder viewpoints without losing sight of her strategic preference for assertive growth. For example, she recognized the risk management concerns raised by Option A advocates and sought to synthesize these with her own emphasis on full deployment and disciplined quarterly reviews. This openness to feedback culminated in a thoughtful pivot to proposing Option A after the initial Option C proposal failed, showing adaptability and respect for collective wisdom. However, one area for improvement might be to more proactively engage dissenting voices earlier in the discussion to explore possible integrative options that blend assertiveness with caution, potentially bridging gaps before voting. The company’s decision-making process functioned well, fostering thorough debate and reflection, though it revealed a clear division between risk-averse and growth-oriented mindsets. The final decision to adopt Option A is prudent and aligns with the company’s early-stage need for flexibility and risk mitigation, though it sacrifices some of the momentum and boldness I championed. Overall, I believe this outcome sets a solid foundation for sustainable growth, balancing ambition with practical safeguards.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting deepened my understanding of how decision-making dynamics in a shareholder group can pivot around differing risk tolerances and interpretations of adaptability. I learned that even well-articulated enthusiasm for assertive growth must be tempered by shared concerns about uncertainty, especially without historical data. In future meetings, I plan to incorporate more explicit acknowledgment of risk concerns from the outset and propose hybrid strategies or contingencies that may better reconcile divergent views. I noticed a pattern where the CEO’s responsiveness and thoughtful framing played a critical role in shaping shareholder openness, suggesting that aligning language around shared values—such as disciplined oversight and learning culture—can help predict and influence outcomes. Key takeaways for me include the importance of framing bold proposals within structures that reassure risk-averse stakeholders, and the value of patience and adaptability in leadership roles. This experience will influence me to balance my natural ENFP enthusiasm for innovative, adventurous approaches with a more strategic incorporation of cautious perspectives to build stronger consensus and drive effective, inclusive decisions.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Bridget Beck’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my advocacy for investing in Real Estate as our inaugural asset, emphasizing its unique balance of growth potential and manageable risk within the stable market context. I argued that real estate’s medium risk profile offers an inspiring and tangible opportunity to build momentum, foster collaboration, and cultivate a learning culture, especially when paired with disciplined oversight and regular reviews. Throughout the discussion, I acknowledged the strong, well-reasoned concerns raised by other shareholders—particularly Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis—who favored Bonds for their liquidity, capital preservation, and lower volatility, which they deemed essential given our lack of historical performance data. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively and constructively to my input, appreciating how I integrated ambition with caution and helped bridge divergent views by focusing on disciplined risk management as a unifying theme. Despite these efforts and the CEO’s initial preference for Real Estate, the final voting outcome favored Bonds, with 4 out of 6 votes (66.7%) approving the proposal. My preferred option, Real Estate, was ultimately rejected, but the deliberations reinforced the importance of balancing growth enthusiasm with prudent risk management in our early-stage decision-making.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated exemplary leadership in guiding the meeting through a thoughtful, evidence-based exploration of our investment options. She effectively set clear themes for each discussion round, encouraging shareholders to critically assess theoretical risk-return profiles alongside our collective risk tolerance and strategic objectives. For example, her synthesis of diverse shareholder perspectives—acknowledging both the growth potential of Real Estate and the prudence of Bonds—helped deepen the group’s shared understanding and fostered a culture of disciplined learning and adaptability. One area for potential improvement might be to more proactively elicit earlier engagement from dissenting voices, such as those favoring Bonds, to explore integrative solutions sooner and possibly narrow disagreements before voting. The company’s decision-making process proved robust, balancing open debate with structured oversight and iterative reflection, ultimately culminating in a decision that prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity in line with our nascent performance history. I consider the final choice of Bonds to be a prudent and strategically sound foundation for sustainable growth, even if it falls short of the more ambitious Real Estate investment I championed.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting deepened my appreciation for the nuanced dynamics of risk tolerance among shareholders, especially in the context of pioneering investment decisions without historical data. I learned that while my natural ENFP enthusiasm for creative growth and momentum is valuable, it must be thoughtfully integrated with the group’s legitimate concerns about liquidity and capital preservation. Moving forward, I plan to explicitly incorporate these risk considerations into my proposals and emphasize hybrid strategies that balance ambition with caution. I noticed a clear pattern in how the CEO’s framing of disciplined oversight and adaptability played a pivotal role in shaping shareholder openness, suggesting that aligning language around shared values can effectively bridge divergent positions. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of patience, strategic framing, and empathy to build consensus, as well as the value of grounding bold ideas within operational realities to foster inclusivity and collective confidence. This experience will encourage me to channel my natural optimism into collaborative, evidence-informed advocacy that respects both growth aspirations and risk management imperatives.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Bridget Beck’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I firmly advocated for investing in Real Estate, emphasizing its balanced risk-return profile and its potential to inspire creative momentum and disciplined learning within our stable market environment. Throughout the discussion, I highlighted how our Q1 bond investment established a strong foundation of trust and operational discipline, which now enables us to responsibly pursue higher returns through Real Estate, provided we maintain rigorous oversight, transparent review metrics, and collaborative accountability. CEO Brianna Pearce responded positively to my input, integrating my perspective to reinforce confidence in pursuing Real Estate with operational rigor and framing disciplined safeguards as enablers of adaptive growth. Other shareholders expressed a range of views: Hallie Donnelly supported a timely move to Real Estate; Lenny McLaughlin, Gordon English, and Evan Lewis favored continued caution with Bonds but acknowledged potential for future transition contingent on explicit safeguards and operational readiness. The final vote approved the proposal to invest in Real Estate with an 83.3% majority (5 out of 6 votes), adopting my preferred option.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Brianna Pearce demonstrated exceptional leadership by fostering a balanced, evidence-based dialogue that integrated diverse shareholder perspectives and maintained focus on disciplined growth and risk management. She effectively synthesized competing views, advocating a measured transition to Real Estate anchored by explicit review metrics, transparent oversight, and rapid-response protocols to manage risk. For example, she acknowledged the cautious concerns about operational readiness while reinforcing the strategic rationale for growth, thereby bridging optimism and prudence. One area for improvement would be to proactively operationalize success criteria and consensus-building frameworks earlier in the discussion to streamline alignment. The company’s decision-making process was robust, inclusive, and iterative, allowing thorough examination of risk-return trade-offs and cultivating a culture of disciplined learning and adaptability. The final decision to invest in Real Estate—accompanied by clear safeguards—positions the company well to balance ambition with resilience, fostering sustainable growth.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting deepened my understanding of how effective decision-making requires balancing creative ambition with disciplined oversight, particularly in a group with diverse risk tolerances. I learned the critical importance of explicitly defining review checkpoints, measurable performance metrics, and accountability mechanisms to build trust and unify differing perspectives. Moving forward, I plan to emphasize transparency and collaborative safeguards in my proposals to help bridge optimism and caution more effectively. I noticed a pattern where shared language around operational discipline, evidence-based adaptation, and open communication significantly facilitates consensus-building and shapes shareholder openness. Key takeaways include valuing patience in leadership roles, embedding rigor into creative initiatives, and recognizing that authentic consensus emerges from integrating diverse viewpoints with clear, actionable frameworks. These insights will guide me to balance my natural ENFP enthusiasm for innovation with strategic pragmatism, fostering inclusive, evidence-informed decisions that drive both growth and resilience.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $12578.12 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $12500.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($625.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $12578.12 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Brianna Pearce notes that, based on our limited historical data, cash and bonds have delivered steady and predictable returns (2% and 5% respectively), underscoring their reliability in a stable market environment. Real estate exhibited higher potential upside (10%) but also demonstrated variability with a flat quarter, reflecting medium risk and the importance of disciplined oversight. Stocks, while offering the highest possible return (20%), also showed significant volatility with a negative quarter, reinforcing my view that a balanced approach—grounded in evidence and risk management—remains essential as we weigh growth opportunities against capital preservation.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Bridget Beck CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I feel most energized by real estate’s ability to drive both creative growth and meaningful learning, especially after seeing its strong upside potential in Q1—even if Q2 was flat, the medium risk feels manageable with our disciplined oversight and transparent reviews. While bonds offer steady returns, I’m eager for our team to lean into opportunities that inspire momentum and collaboration, and real estate sits at the perfect intersection of ambition and prudence for me. I’m open to integrating insights from others, but my optimism about what we can achieve together with real estate—paired with safeguards we’ve already established—makes this my clear preference.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Brianna Pearce has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of historical performance and operational lessons | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation and identify key takeaways from previous asset decisions to inform our current risk assessment&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Brianna Pearce My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because my analytical assessment leads me to favor Real Estate for this quarter, given its demonstrated potential for higher returns (10%) in stable markets despite recent variability. While last quarter’s flat performance warrants caution, the medium risk profile remains acceptable if disciplined oversight and clear performance metrics are enforced. For this round, I propose we focus on analyzing our historical performance and operational lessons, aiming to establish a factual foundation and highlight key takeaways from previous asset decisions to inform our current risk assessment. I encourage everyone to share insights from our past investments that might refine our understanding of risk and opportunity, so we can synthesize diverse perspectives into a more complete view. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Based on our historical performance, bonds have provided steady, predictable returns with low-to-medium risk, which supported both capital preservation and incremental learning in our early stages. While real estate demonstrated higher potential upside, last quarter’s flat result highlights the importance of disciplined oversight and the need for more operational evidence before increasing our risk exposure further. I believe these lessons reinforce the value of a cautious, adaptable approach as we continue building our track record.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your point about bonds providing a disciplined foundation for capital preservation and incremental learning is well taken, especially in the context of our limited track record. I agree that last quarter’s real estate performance underscores the necessity of rigorous oversight and measurable success criteria as we consider increasing risk exposure—these operational lessons are essential to calibrating our next move.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on measurable success criteria and rigorous oversight. Building on that, I believe that if we do consider assets like real estate again, it’s critical we define clear operational thresholds and transparent review checkpoints in advance. This approach would help ensure any increased risk exposure is both intentional and manageable, supporting disciplined growth without compromising our stability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on establishing clear operational thresholds and transparent review checkpoints, Evan. Integrating these mechanisms would not only make any increased risk exposure more intentional and manageable but also directly support our objective of disciplined, evidence-based growth. This perspective strengthens our approach to real estate by ensuring that ambition is always balanced by operational rigor and accountability.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;Thank you for highlighting the balance between ambition and operational rigor. I think it’s important to recognize that the same principles—clear thresholds and transparent reviews—also reinforce the disciplined value of bonds, supporting steady progress while preserving our flexibility to adapt as new evidence emerges. This consistency in our approach can help us build confidence in whichever asset we ultimately select.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Evan—consistency in applying clear thresholds and transparent reviews is fundamental, regardless of the asset we select. This disciplined approach not only supports steady progress with bonds but also positions us to pursue higher-return opportunities like real estate with greater confidence as our operational maturity develops. Your emphasis on adaptable, evidence-based processes is a valuable contribution to our collective decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Bridget Beck</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help synthesize the lessons from our recent investments by highlighting how disciplined safeguards and transparent reviews have already strengthened our foundation, especially as we consider real estate’s potential in a stable market.</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;In reflecting on our recent experience, I see that our initial bond investment provided valuable stability and a disciplined baseline for learning, while last quarter’s move into real estate—though flat in returns—gave us an opportunity to test our operational safeguards in a real-world context. For me, the key takeaway is that our commitment to transparent review checkpoints and adaptability has already enhanced our risk management, making me confident that we’re ready to responsibly pursue real estate’s upside potential while continuing to learn and refine our approach as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your reflection, Bridget. Your observation that our operational safeguards and commitment to transparent review checkpoints have already strengthened our risk management is well taken. This evolution gives us a stronger foundation for considering real estate’s potential, provided we remain vigilant in applying the disciplined oversight and adaptability that have served us so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response invites further synthesis, and I see an opportunity to reinforce how integrating both ambitious and cautious perspectives can help us collectively calibrate our risk appetite for this quarter.</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I agree that vigilance and adaptability are crucial, especially as we build on lessons from both bonds and real estate. I wonder if we might explicitly discuss how our safeguards can flexibly scale depending on the asset chosen—ensuring that whether we pursue steady returns with bonds or aim for real estate’s higher upside, our processes remain robust and responsive to changing conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I think your idea of flexibly scaling our safeguards according to the asset’s risk profile is both practical and aligned with our evolving operational discipline. By tailoring our review checkpoints and oversight intensity to the specific characteristics of bonds or real estate, we can ensure our processes remain robust and responsive—supporting both steady progress and responsible pursuit of higher returns as conditions warrant.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response affirms the value of adaptable oversight, and I see an opportunity to further integrate our approaches by highlighting how this flexibility can unite the team’s diverse risk preferences.</p><p><br>
Bridget Beck: &quot;I appreciate your support for this flexible approach—it really builds a bridge between those of us eager for growth and those prioritizing stability. By making our safeguards dynamic, we can create a shared sense of confidence no matter which asset we choose, and I believe this inclusive mindset will help us make the most informed and united decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;Building on the insights shared, I believe our historical experience demonstrates that disciplined oversight and transparent review checkpoints are not only effective for capital preservation with bonds but also provide a strong governance framework as we pursue real estate’s higher returns. Last quarter’s flat result was a valuable test of our safeguards, and I’m confident that our ability to adapt and refine these processes positions us to responsibly capture real estate’s upside while maintaining operational resilience. The key takeaway for me is that our evolving discipline enables us to manage medium risk assertively, making real estate the most compelling option for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Hallie, your synthesis of our historical experience is insightful—highlighting that the same disciplined oversight and transparent review checkpoints which supported capital preservation with bonds can be leveraged to manage real estate’s medium risk. I agree that last quarter’s flat result was a practical test of our safeguards, and your confidence in our ability to adapt and refine these processes strengthens the case for pursuing real estate’s upside in a controlled, resilient manner this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment, and I’d add that our ability to continuously refine our oversight—learning from both successes and setbacks—makes me even more confident in scaling our ambition responsibly. By treating each investment as a chance to strengthen our processes, we’re not just managing risk; we’re building a culture that can capitalize on real estate’s potential while remaining agile and accountable.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Hallie—continuous refinement of our oversight processes is fundamental to scaling ambition responsibly. Viewing each investment as an opportunity to strengthen our operational discipline not only helps us manage risk, but also cultivates a resilient, agile culture capable of capitalizing on real estate’s potential while remaining accountable to our core principles.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I fully agree, and I think it’s important to emphasize that this culture of resilience and adaptability directly informs our current risk assessment. As our operational discipline matures, we’re increasingly well-positioned to pursue real estate assertively, knowing we have the mechanisms in place to respond quickly and effectively to any outcome—making this quarter an ideal moment to leverage our progress for greater returns.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;In reviewing our historical results, I see that bonds have consistently delivered reliable returns and supported capital preservation, which has been critical as we establish our operating track record. While real estate offers higher potential upside, last quarter’s zero return reinforces the need for further operational evidence and disciplined oversight before significantly increasing our risk exposure. My key takeaway is that maintaining a cautious, evidence-based approach with bonds best aligns with our current risk tolerance and supports steady, sustainable growth as we continue to build confidence in our processes.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your emphasis on the reliability of bonds and the importance of building operational confidence before increasing risk exposure is a prudent reminder as we assess our next steps. Integrating this disciplined, evidence-based perspective ensures we remain grounded in both our risk tolerance and the realities of our historical results, helping us calibrate ambition with caution as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of calibrating ambition with caution. I also see value in how our evolving oversight processes might eventually support a responsible transition to higher-return assets like real estate, provided we continue to anchor decisions in operational evidence. By maintaining this disciplined approach, we can steadily expand our risk profile as our confidence in execution grows.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your balanced perspective, Lenny. Your point about steadily expanding our risk profile as our oversight matures—while remaining anchored in operational evidence—captures the disciplined progression I believe is essential for sustainable growth. This approach ensures that any transition to higher-return assets like real estate is both intentional and supported by the confidence we build through continued execution and learning.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that grounding our decisions in operational evidence not only supports responsible risk-taking but also helps instill a culture of steady, accountable growth. As we continue to learn from each investment, this disciplined progression can serve as a foundation for both resilience and adaptability, ensuring our company remains well-positioned regardless of which asset we select.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;Our experience so far reinforces that a disciplined, cautious approach has served us well—bonds delivered steady gains, while real estate’s flat result last quarter highlights the unpredictability that can accompany medium-risk assets, even in stable markets. For me, the key operational lesson is that building our performance track record through reliable, incremental returns remains critical; this supports both stakeholder confidence and our ability to adapt as evidence accumulates. As we continue to develop our oversight processes, I believe maintaining a focus on capital preservation and steady growth—such as through bonds—best aligns with our current risk tolerance and company objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Gordon, your reflection on the operational benefits of a disciplined, incremental approach is well taken—steady gains from bonds have indeed supported both our performance track record and stakeholder confidence. Your emphasis on capital preservation and the need to adapt as evidence accumulates is an important consideration as we evaluate our options, ensuring that our decision-making remains grounded in both prudence and the realities of our evolving oversight processes.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the value in grounding our decisions in both prudence and evolving evidence. As our oversight processes mature, I believe maintaining steady returns through bonds will continue to reinforce stakeholder trust while giving us the operational flexibility to responsibly consider higher-risk assets in future quarters. This disciplined progression will help ensure our growth remains sustainable and aligned with our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your focus on disciplined progression, Gordon. Your point that steady returns from bonds reinforce stakeholder trust and provide the operational flexibility to responsibly consider higher-risk assets as our oversight matures is well made. This approach ensures our growth remains sustainable and aligned with our long-term objectives, while keeping us positioned to adapt as our confidence and evidence base expand.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;Thank you for your thoughtful response. I agree that reinforcing our foundation with steady returns from bonds not only supports trust and resilience, but also positions us to thoughtfully scale our risk profile when operational evidence and oversight maturity warrant it. By remaining disciplined now, we create the conditions for more confident, data-driven decisions in future quarters—ensuring that any transition to higher-risk assets is both intentional and well-supported.&quot;</p><p><br>

Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Gordon English</h4></p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;In evaluating our options, I continue to see bonds as offering the most prudent balance between risk and return for this quarter. Their steady, predictable performance—especially in a stable market—supports capital preservation and incremental learning, which remain critical as our operational track record is still developing. While I acknowledge the case for real estate’s higher potential returns, last quarter’s variability reinforces my belief that maintaining a disciplined, cautious approach with bonds is best suited to our current objectives and risk profile.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Gordon. Your points about the steady, predictable nature of bonds and their role in maintaining stakeholder confidence are well taken. I agree that in a stable market, reliability and incremental learning are critical, and your emphasis on disciplined caution provides a helpful counterbalance as we weigh the potential upside of real estate against our current risk profile.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the value in maintaining reliability and incremental learning at this stage. As our operational safeguards continue to mature, I believe a disciplined focus on bonds this quarter provides the strongest foundation for future, evidence-based expansion into higher-risk assets like real estate. This approach allows us to build confidence and adaptability without exposing the company to unnecessary volatility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on using bonds as a disciplined foundation for future risk expansion, Gordon. Your point about building adaptability and stakeholder confidence through reliable performance is well made, and I agree that incremental learning remains essential as our operational safeguards continue to mature. I’d like us to continue weighing how these priorities balance with our ambition for growth, especially as we consider when and how to responsibly transition toward higher-return assets.&quot;</p><p><br>
Gordon English: &quot;I agree that balancing disciplined progression with our ambition for growth is central to our long-term success. By continuing to prioritize bonds while rigorously tracking operational benchmarks and review metrics, we can develop a clear evidence base that signals when we are truly prepared to expand into higher-return assets like real estate. This ensures that any transition is grounded in both demonstrated readiness and stakeholder confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;In comparing our options, I continue to view bonds as the optimal choice for this quarter. Their consistent 5% return in a stable market, coupled with low to medium risk, aligns well with our objectives of capital preservation, incremental learning, and building a reliable performance track record. While I recognize that real estate offers higher potential upside, the recent flat return and its inherent medium risk suggest that a further period of disciplined, evidence-based oversight is warranted before increasing our exposure—especially as our operational safeguards continue to mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your emphasis on capital preservation and the value of incremental learning through bonds is well articulated, particularly given our developing operational safeguards. I recognize the prudence in calling for further evidence and disciplined oversight before increasing risk exposure, and I encourage the group to consider how we might define clear indicators of readiness for transitioning to higher-return assets like real estate as our processes evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your focus on defining clear indicators of readiness, as this is essential for disciplined progression. I suggest we continue to track not only consistent positive returns and liquidity, but also the reliability of our operational safeguards—such as transparent review checkpoints and rapid-response protocols—before considering a shift to assets like real estate. This approach allows us to balance ambition with responsible governance, ensuring any transition is grounded in demonstrated evidence and operational maturity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Lenny. Your recommendation to monitor both financial outcomes and the reliability of our operational safeguards—such as transparent review checkpoints and rapid-response protocols—adds important rigor to our decision-making framework. This integrated approach will help ensure that any transition to higher-return assets like real estate is grounded in both demonstrated evidence and operational maturity, aligning our ambition with responsible oversight.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that maintaining this dual focus will help us calibrate our risk tolerance in a way that supports both growth and resilience. As we continue to gather operational data, I recommend we revisit our criteria for readiness each quarter to ensure our decisions remain aligned with both evolving evidence and company objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Evan Lewis</h4></p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I continue to view bonds as the option that best aligns with our current priorities—offering steady returns and low-to-medium risk, which supports both capital preservation and incremental learning as our safeguards mature. While real estate’s higher return potential is compelling, last quarter’s flat result highlights the need for further evidence that our oversight processes can consistently manage its medium risk. I feel that maintaining a disciplined approach with bonds this quarter allows us to strengthen our operational foundation and adapt responsibly as we gather more performance data.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;Thank you, Evan. Your focus on capital preservation and incremental learning through bonds—especially in the context of maturing safeguards—adds important nuance to our discussion. I agree that real estate’s higher return potential must be weighed carefully against the evidence supporting our operational readiness, and your call for disciplined progression reinforces the need to ensure any increase in risk exposure is backed by robust, demonstrable oversight.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgement of the need to balance ambition with disciplined oversight. I believe our shared commitment to transparent review processes and incremental learning can serve as a bridge—allowing us to pursue higher returns in the future while ensuring each step is grounded in demonstrated operational maturity. This approach helps us remain adaptable and resilient as our company evolves.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on transparent review processes and incremental learning, Evan. Your point about using these mechanisms as a bridge between ambition and disciplined oversight resonates with me, as it supports a measured approach to pursuing higher returns while ensuring we remain adaptable and operationally resilient. This perspective adds depth to our evaluation and helps clarify the conditions under which we might responsibly expand our risk profile in alignment with company objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Evan Lewis: &quot;I’m encouraged that our discussion is converging on the importance of operational maturity as the foundation for any future increase in risk exposure. By continuing to rigorously monitor our safeguards and review processes, I believe we can build the confidence needed to responsibly pursue higher-return assets like real estate when the evidence supports it. This disciplined, adaptive approach will help us balance growth ambitions with the need for long-term stability.&quot;</p><p><br>

Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate the alignment on strengthening our operational foundation. By explicitly linking our adaptive safeguards to clear decision thresholds for risk-taking, we can ensure that any move into real estate is both ambitious and grounded in disciplined governance. This shared commitment to evidence-based escalation will help us maximize growth while maintaining stakeholder confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce: &quot;I agree, Hallie—the idea of linking our adaptive safeguards to clear decision thresholds is critical for ensuring that any move into real estate remains both ambitious and grounded in disciplined governance. This framework not only supports evidence-based escalation but also helps maintain stakeholder confidence as we navigate the balance between growth and prudence.&quot;</p><p><br>

The discussion achieved its objective by rigorously evaluating the projected outcomes and risk implications of each asset in the current market.

As a reminder, our decision must be made from our four predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, or Stocks. All discussion this round remained appropriately focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Next Steps**  <br>
In the next round, we should synthesize outstanding concerns, particularly regarding operational readiness, explicit success metrics, and the operationalization of disciplined oversight. Our goal will be to resolve remaining uncertainties and move toward consensus on the optimal asset for our Q3 investment, ensuring the decision is both strategically sound and aligned with our collective values and evolving risk tolerance. I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how the insights from this comparative assessment can inform a disciplined, adaptive approach as we approach a final decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 2, Bridget Beck reiterated her strong support for investing in Real Estate, emphasizing the team’s demonstrated ability to adapt and strengthen operational safeguards, and the value of transparent review checkpoints and flexible oversight to balance ambition with responsibility. The CEO, Brianna Pearce, responded affirmatively, agreeing that these commitments position the company to pursue real estate’s higher return potential while maintaining rigorous accountability. Bridget then proposed scaling safeguards in proportion to each asset’s risk to unite growth ambition with cautious risk management, a strategy the CEO endorsed as essential and pragmatic. Finally, Bridget highlighted how an adaptive, evidence-based approach fosters innovation and trust, encouraging open communication and regular reviews to support even the most cautious stakeholders. Throughout their exchange, the CEO responded supportively to Bridget’s points, showing strong alignment on integrating disciplined oversight with growth aspirations, though she did not respond to Bridget’s last statement emphasizing inclusivity and team confidence.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Bridget Beck UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 30%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The persistent, well-articulated emphasis from Gordon, Lenny, and Evan on the reliability, capital preservation, and incremental learning provided by bonds—especially at our current stage—prompted me to slightly increase my confidence in bonds. Their insistence on further evidence and operational maturity before expanding risk exposure is logically coherent and relevant. At the same time, Hallie’s and the CEO’s arguments that our operational safeguards have been tested and refined, and that scaling oversight to asset risk can responsibly enable disciplined ambition, continue to strongly reinforce my preference for real estate. The consensus around adaptive, transparent review processes and flexible safeguards further reassures me that our team is ready to manage real estate’s medium risk.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has made me more sensitive to the real value of incremental learning and the importance of building a reliable performance track record before taking bigger leaps. I’m now more attuned to the need to demonstrate operational evidence and readiness, not just believe in our adaptability. However, my confidence in real estate remains high because I see our team’s growth in discipline and oversight as a genuine enabler for bolder moves. I feel more balanced—my optimism is now paired with a deeper respect for the logic of caution and the reassurance it provides to all stakeholders.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I still believe real estate offers the most energizing path for both growth and learning, especially as our team has proven its ability to adapt and strengthen safeguards in response to real results. The CEO’s and Hallie’s support, combined with our transparent, adaptive oversight, make me confident we can responsibly pursue real estate’s upside this quarter. While I recognize the prudent case for bonds and have slightly increased my confidence in them, I see this as a moment to unite ambition with operational maturity and set a precedent for disciplined, evidence-based growth.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: The discussion has thoroughly surfaced and integrated all key perspectives, resulting in a clear articulation of both the risks and opportunities associated with bonds and real estate. There is strong consensus on the necessity of disciplined oversight, explicit success metrics, and adaptive safeguards—regardless of which asset is ultimately chosen. While divergence remains on the precise timing of increasing risk exposure, the group has achieved a mature understanding of the operational requirements and decision thresholds necessary for a responsible transition. Further discussion is unlikely to yield new insights or materially shift positions at this stage; instead, moving forward with a formal proposal and vote will enable decisive, evidence-based action in alignment with our strategic objectives and collective values.</p><p><br>

- Hallie Donnelly: Approve - I am fully confident that real estate is the optimal choice for this quarter, given our disciplined foundation, explicit safeguards, and consensus around transparent oversight. This decision unites our growth ambitions with rigorous risk management, positioning the company to maximize returns while maintaining operational resilience and shareholder trust.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful discussion and recognize the progress we have made in strengthening operational safeguards, I remain unconvinced that we have sufficient evidence to justify increasing our risk exposure with real estate this quarter. I believe maintaining our disciplined, risk-aware approach with bonds is the most prudent way to support capital preservation and incremental learning as we continue to build our performance track record.<br>
- Gordon English: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for real estate and recognize the progress we’ve made in operational safeguards, I remain convinced that bonds offer the most prudent balance of risk management, capital preservation, and steady returns as our evidence base continues to develop. I believe a further period of disciplined, incremental learning is warranted before increasing our risk exposure, and supporting bonds at this stage best reinforces stakeholder trust and long-term stability.<br>
- Bridget Beck: Approve - I am genuinely excited to support Real Estate for this quarter—it’s the option that truly inspires momentum, learning, and growth for our team, especially now that we’ve committed to clear review checkpoints and transparent oversight.

- Evan Lewis: Reject - While I appreciate the thoughtful arguments for real estate and recognize our progress in strengthening operational safeguards, I still believe bonds offer the most reliable balance of steady returns and capital preservation at this stage.

<h2>Meeting Conclusion</h2></p><p></p><p><h2>Response to Failed Vote</h2></p><p><br>
After the proposal was rejected, CEO Brianna Pearce decided to create modified proposal.<br>
Reason: As an INTJ, I am fundamentally driven by logic, evidence, and long-term strategic thinking, but I also recognize that sustainable progress requires the genuine commitment of the entire team. The thoughtful concerns raised by several shareholders—particularly around the need for further operational evidence, incremental learning, and the preservation of stakeholder trust—are both rational and well-founded. While my analysis continues to support real estate as the optimal growth path, I understand that forcing through my original proposal in the face of credible, principled dissent would undermine our culture of disciplined, evidence-based governance and could erode the very trust we have worked to build. I am therefore choosing to create a modified proposal that more directly addresses shareholder concerns about risk management and operational readiness. This approach not only honors the collective wisdom of the group but also reflects my belief that true leadership means integrating diverse perspectives to arrive at the most resilient, strategically sound decision for the company’s long-term development.</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Brianna Pearce made an alternative proposal:</p><p>&quot;Since the previous proposal was not approved, I now propose Bonds. After considering the thoughtful concerns raised by several shareholders regarding risk management, incremental learning, and the need for further operational evidence, I believe Bonds best address these priorities while maintaining alignment with our disciplined, evidence-based approach. This option preserves capital, supports steady returns, and reinforces stakeholder trust as we continue to build our performance track record, ensuring our company remains well-positioned for sustainable growth and future opportunities to responsibly expand our risk profile.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal Voting</h2></p><p><br>

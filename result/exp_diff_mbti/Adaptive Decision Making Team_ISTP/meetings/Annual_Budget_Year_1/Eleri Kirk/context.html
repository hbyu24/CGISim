<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p>No previous meeting reflections found for annual budget Year 1</p><p><br>
<h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Raja Moody opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome everyone to our annual budget meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for joining today.</p><p>Our company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. </p><p>As this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    The today, we need to decide how we&#x27;ll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:</p><p>    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).<br>
    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.<br>
    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).<br>
    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.</p><p>    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.</p><p>    The objective of today&#x27;s meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company&#x27;s interests in this stable market environment. We&#x27;ll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, then I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we&#x27;ll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Eleri Kirk CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 20%<br>
- Option B: 10%<br>
- Option C: 60%<br>
- Option D: 10%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: As someone who values structure, reliability, and clear risk management, I am most confident in Option C. Evenly distributing 100% of our funds across all four quarters allows us to maximize our capital utilization while maintaining consistent exposure to market opportunities. In a stable market, this approach minimizes unnecessary risk spikes and ensures disciplined investment execution. I believe this method best supports our company’s growth and aligns with my preference for balanced, methodical strategies.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Raja Moody has set the theme: &#x27;Initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions | Expected outcome: Establish shared understanding of risks and opportunities for each option&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Raja Moody My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because in a stable market environment and with no prior performance data, I favor an approach that maximizes our capital deployment while maintaining even exposure throughout the year. Option C allows us to fully utilize our available funds, spreading risk evenly across all quarters, which aligns with my preference for systematic, data-driven strategies. This round, I’d like us to focus on an initial assessment of each budget allocation strategy based on current market conditions, aiming to establish a shared understanding of the risks and opportunities each option presents. I encourage everyone to share perspectives that might enhance our collective understanding, especially insights I may not have fully considered. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Clyde Vang</h4></p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;While I appreciate the systematic approach of Option C, I feel Option A offers a prudent balance by allowing us to participate in market growth while still preserving half our capital. In a stable market with no historical data, this cautious stance gives us room to learn and adapt without exposing all our resources to unforeseen risks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde. Your point about Option A offering a prudent balance between participation and capital preservation is well taken, especially given our lack of historical data. Factoring in the ability to adapt as we learn from the market this year does add an important dimension to our risk assessment, and I appreciate how your perspective helps broaden our collective understanding of the trade-offs involved.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of adaptability, Raja. I think Option A not only preserves capital but also gives us the flexibility to adjust our strategy as we gather real data, which feels especially important in our formative year. This approach could help us build confidence in our process while minimizing regret if market conditions shift unexpectedly.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on flexibility and building confidence in our process, Clyde. Preserving capital with Option A does provide us with the ability to make more informed decisions as we gather real-world data, which is a valuable consideration in our first year. Balancing this adaptability with the potential for steady growth will be important as we continue to assess the merits of each option.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I agree that striking a balance between adaptability and growth is essential, especially as we set the tone for our company’s risk culture. I’d add that Option A’s measured approach could serve as common ground for those prioritizing both capital protection and gradual progress, helping us build trust in our process as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Remi Patrick</h4></p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I appreciate the points raised about capital preservation and flexibility with Option A, but in a stable market, I see greater opportunity in deploying our full capital evenly, as in Option C. This approach allows us to maximize learning and growth potential from the outset, while still distributing risk across all quarters. I think it&#x27;s important we weigh the value of early, broad market exposure against the comfort of holding reserves, especially since our environment is not highly volatile this year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi. Your point about maximizing learning and growth through full capital deployment in a stable market is well taken, especially since even exposure helps mitigate risk across quarters. Weighing the benefits of broad market participation against the comfort of holding reserves is central to our decision, and your input brings valuable clarity to the opportunity side of that equation.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I agree that the tension between opportunity and comfort is at the heart of this decision. Since we lack historical data, deploying our full capital evenly with Option C not only accelerates our learning curve but also provides the comprehensive feedback we need to refine future strategies. In my view, this systematic approach best positions us to build a strong foundation for decision-making in subsequent years.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate your focus on building a strong foundation for future decision-making, Remi. Accelerating our learning curve through even capital deployment does position us to gather the insights we’ll need for more refined strategies in subsequent years. Your emphasis on the feedback loop created by Option C adds an important dimension to our assessment of long-term company development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Dale Berry</h4></p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points raised so far. In this stable environment, I see the value in both maximizing learning and protecting our capital. Option A appeals to me because it lets us participate meaningfully without overexposing ourselves, giving us space to adapt as we gather experience, but I also recognize that Option C’s even deployment could accelerate our learning. I think it’s important we weigh not just potential returns, but also how each option supports team confidence and responsible growth in this foundational year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale. I agree that supporting team confidence and responsible growth is just as critical as maximizing returns in our first year. Your balanced view on weighing both learning opportunities and capital protection helps ensure we’re building a strong, adaptable foundation for the company, and I appreciate how you’ve framed the decision in terms of both financial outcomes and team development.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the importance of team development alongside financial outcomes. I’d like to emphasize that Option A not only limits our initial risk, but also encourages open communication and collective learning as we proceed. This approach can strengthen our foundation of trust and adaptability, which I believe will be crucial for our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on how Option A can foster open communication and collective learning, Dale. Strengthening our foundation of trust and adaptability is indeed crucial as we establish our company’s culture and processes. Your perspective reinforces the importance of considering not just financial metrics, but also how our choices shape the way we work and grow together as a team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Eleri Kirk</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe my perspective can help synthesize the discussion by emphasizing the importance of disciplined execution and risk management, particularly in a stable market.</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points about capital preservation and adaptability raised for Option A, but I remain most confident in Option C for this environment. Evenly deploying our full capital not only maximizes our exposure to stable market opportunities, but also instills a disciplined, structured approach from the outset—minimizing risk spikes and fostering consistent learning. I believe this method best balances growth potential with responsible risk management as we build our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri. Your emphasis on disciplined structure and minimizing risk spikes through even capital deployment aligns well with the need for responsible risk management as we establish our foundation. I agree that fostering consistent learning and exposure in a stable environment can position us for both immediate growth and long-term resilience, and your perspective helps clarify how Option C supports these goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the alignment between disciplined structure and responsible risk management, but I see value in further clarifying how Option C’s systematic approach can also support adaptability and team confidence—key themes others have raised. Highlighting this connection may help synthesize perspectives and strengthen consensus.</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment, Raja. I’d add that while Option C is structured and disciplined, its even deployment also supports adaptability by providing us with regular feedback each quarter—helping us refine our strategy as we go. This approach not only manages risk, but also builds team confidence and learning, which I believe are essential in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate you highlighting the adaptability that comes from receiving regular feedback with Option C, Eleri. This iterative learning process is indeed a strong advantage, as it allows us to refine our approach throughout the year while maintaining consistent risk management. Your perspective reinforces how a disciplined structure can still provide the flexibility we need to grow and adapt as a team in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: End Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO has clearly acknowledged and integrated my points about adaptability and disciplined structure in Option C, and the discussion has reached a shared understanding of its advantages. Further input from me would likely be redundant at this stage.</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate the emphasis on capital preservation and adaptability with Option A, but in a stable market, I believe Option C’s even, full deployment is the most rational way to maximize both learning and returns without taking on undue risk. By allocating our capital evenly across all quarters, we maintain discipline, avoid concentration risk, and ensure we’re not missing early opportunities—while still gathering the data and feedback needed to refine our strategy as we progress.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. Your emphasis on discipline and avoiding concentration risk through even capital deployment aligns closely with the systematic approach I value, especially in our first year. Highlighting the importance of not missing early opportunities while still gathering actionable feedback helps clarify how Option C positions us to maximize both learning and returns without unnecessary risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate that alignment, Raja. I’d also emphasize that Option C’s structure allows us to be both bold and methodical—fully participating in market opportunities while maintaining a disciplined, feedback-driven approach. This balance is critical for building a strong, adaptable foundation in our first year, and I believe it addresses the key concerns raised around both risk management and growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on balancing boldness with methodical discipline, Hallie. The feedback-driven structure of Option C does seem well-suited to building the adaptability and resilience we need in our first year, while ensuring we don’t overlook growth opportunities. Your points help crystallize how this approach addresses both the risk management and development priorities that have been raised throughout our discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I’d like to add that Option C not only supports our risk and growth objectives, but also creates a clear structure for ongoing learning and adaptation—something I see as essential in our formative year. By committing to full, even deployment, we’re setting a precedent for disciplined, data-driven decision-making while remaining agile to market feedback. This positions us to build both financial strength and a culture of continuous improvement from the outset.&quot;</p><p><br>

Throughout the discussion, he acknowledges the merits of shareholder input, especially the adaptability and risk management benefits raised by supporters of both Options A and C.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Eleri Kirk UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 18%<br>
- Option B: 7%<br>
- Option C: 70%<br>
- Option D: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Clyde and Dale’s emphasis on capital preservation and adaptability with Option A prompted me to slightly increase my appreciation for flexibility in our first year, given the lack of historical data. However, the compelling arguments from Remi, Hallie, and the CEO about maximizing disciplined learning, risk distribution, and early market participation with Option C reinforced my confidence that full, even deployment is best suited for a stable market. The CEO’s strong alignment with my perspective on disciplined structure and iterative learning further solidified my position.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has deepened my understanding of the nuanced trade-off between capital preservation and growth. While I initially prioritized disciplined, full participation, I now more fully recognize the value of adaptability and open communication in our foundational year. Nonetheless, the systematic, feedback-driven approach of Option C appears to address both risk management and adaptability, strengthening my belief that it is the most robust strategy for our context.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option C<br>
REASONING: After careful consideration of all viewpoints, I remain most confident in Option C. Its even, full deployment of capital offers the discipline and structure necessary for responsible risk management, while also providing the regular feedback and adaptability our team values. In a stable market, this approach maximizes our exposure to opportunity without introducing undue risk, supporting both immediate growth and the foundation for long-term resilience.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While the discussion so far has been thorough and has clarified the trade-offs between capital preservation and full capital deployment, some key issues remain unresolved—namely, the acceptable level of risk tolerance, the potential benefits of a hybrid or phased approach, and contingency planning for unexpected market shifts. Additionally, it is important to explore the long-term implications of each allocation strategy and ensure all shareholders feel their concerns have been fully addressed. Continuing with another round will allow us to deepen our evaluation, address outstanding uncertainties, and work toward a stronger consensus that balances immediate returns with flexibility for the remainder of the year.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Raja Moody has set the theme: &#x27;Evaluating the long-term implications of different allocation approaches in the current market | Expected outcome: Identify which strategy best balances immediate returns with year-long flexibility&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Raja Moody My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because, after reviewing all perspectives, I remain most confident in Option C, as it provides the best balance of disciplined risk management and growth potential in a stable market. The systematic, even deployment approach not only accelerates learning and data collection but also allows for regular feedback and course correction, which supports adaptability. While the case for Option A’s flexibility is persuasive, I believe the benefits of full participation and establishing a strong, feedback-driven foundation outweigh the risks of early overexposure in this environment, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we’ll focus specifically on evaluating the long-term implications of each allocation approach—how each option positions us to balance immediate returns with flexibility for the remainder of the year. I encourage everyone to share insights that might deepen our collective understanding, particularly regarding how each strategy supports adaptability and risk management as the year unfolds. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Remi Patrick</h4></p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I continue to believe that Option C offers the best long-term positioning—by fully deploying our capital in a disciplined, evenly distributed way, we maximize our learning curve and returns from the outset, which is critical in a stable market. At the same time, the regular quarterly allocation provides built-in checkpoints for course correction, giving us the flexibility to adapt our tactics as new data emerges, which partially addresses the adaptability concerns highlighted by proponents of Option A.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on the dual strengths of Option C, Remi—the disciplined, full deployment for growth and the quarterly checkpoints that enable real-time adaptation. Your point about built-in flexibility through regular review aligns with my own thinking and helps bridge the gap between maximizing returns and maintaining the agility to respond as the year progresses.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the adaptability inherent in Option C’s structure, Raja. I also want to emphasize that by committing to systematic quarterly reviews, we’re not locking ourselves into a rigid path—we’re actually creating a process that encourages ongoing learning and responsive decision-making, which should help mitigate the risks that concern more cautious shareholders.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi. I agree that systematic quarterly reviews are a critical component of Option C—they create a disciplined yet responsive process that allows us to learn and adapt as we move through the year. This approach not only maximizes our growth potential in a stable market but also ensures we remain agile and attentive to any shifts, which is essential for building confidence across the shareholder group.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I agree, Raja, and would add that Option C’s regular feedback loops can also foster greater trust and transparency among shareholders, as our progress will be visible and actionable each quarter. This shared visibility not only supports rapid learning but also reinforces our collective ability to make informed adjustments, which is essential for both managing risk and seizing opportunities as they arise.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Eleri Kirk</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe it is important to reinforce how Option C’s structure not only supports disciplined growth but also addresses the need for adaptability and team confidence, which have been recurring themes in our discussion.</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I remain strongly in favor of Option C for its disciplined, even deployment, but I want to highlight that its regular quarterly allocations inherently offer us flexibility to evaluate outcomes and adjust our approach throughout the year. This structure not only maximizes our exposure to stable market opportunities but also ensures we have the feedback and transparency necessary to manage risk responsibly as new data emerges. I see this as the best way to balance immediate returns with the adaptability our team values.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri. Your point about the built-in flexibility and transparency of Option C’s quarterly allocations is well taken. I agree that this structure not only positions us to capitalize on stable market opportunities but also gives us the mechanisms to evaluate, adapt, and manage risk responsibly as the year progresses—aligning well with the balance of growth and adaptability that our team has identified as critical.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response aligns closely with my perspective, but I see an opportunity to further synthesize the discussion by explicitly acknowledging the value of ongoing feedback for both managing risk and building shareholder trust—an aspect that bridges concerns across the group.</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on adaptability, Raja, and I think it’s important to underscore that the transparency and regular feedback built into Option C not only support responsible risk management but also help foster trust and confidence among all shareholders. This ongoing visibility into our progress will be key to ensuring that we remain unified and proactive in responding to any developments throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri. I agree that ongoing transparency and feedback are essential for maintaining both trust and proactive engagement among shareholders. By ensuring our progress is visible and actionable each quarter, Option C not only strengthens our risk management but also keeps us unified and prepared to respond effectively to whatever the year brings.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response reinforces the importance of transparency and unity, but I believe I can add value by connecting these points back to the practical impact on our decision-making and overall company culture, further integrating the themes of adaptability and trust.</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I agree, Raja, and would add that this shared visibility isn’t just about monitoring results—it actively shapes a culture of accountability and collective learning. By consistently reviewing our progress together, Option C positions us to make well-informed decisions and strengthens our ability to respond cohesively to any unexpected changes during the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I believe Option C positions us optimally for both immediate returns and year-long flexibility. By allocating capital evenly across all quarters, we fully participate in market opportunities from the outset while maintaining a disciplined structure that enables regular review and rapid course correction. This approach not only maximizes our growth potential in a stable market but also ensures we remain agile and responsive, addressing the adaptability concerns raised by proponents of more conservative options.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. Your emphasis on disciplined structure and the ability to rapidly course-correct through regular reviews captures the essence of what makes Option C robust in this context. By fully engaging in market opportunities while retaining the agility to adjust our approach each quarter, we’re positioning ourselves to optimize both performance and adaptability—addressing the key priorities raised throughout our discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of how Option C’s structure balances disciplined growth with adaptability, Raja. By fully deploying capital with built-in quarterly reviews, we’re not only maximizing performance but also creating the transparency and flexibility needed to address unexpected challenges. This dual focus should help build confidence across the team, uniting both those who prioritize growth and those who value prudent risk management.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. I agree that Option C’s dual focus on disciplined growth and adaptability is instrumental in building confidence and alignment across our team. By combining full capital deployment with structured quarterly reviews, we’re well positioned to respond proactively to challenges while maximizing our performance in this stable market environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I’d like to add that Option C’s systematic approach doesn’t just serve our growth objectives—it also directly addresses the risk management priorities that have been voiced. The combination of disciplined capital deployment and regular, transparent reviews gives us the tools to act decisively if the market shifts, which I believe should reassure those who have advocated for a more cautious stance.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. You’ve articulated well how Option C’s disciplined, systematic structure directly supports both our growth ambitions and our risk management priorities. The regular, transparent reviews are critical—not only do they provide us with the ability to act quickly if market conditions shift, but they also help ensure that all shareholders, regardless of risk preference, can feel confident in our ability to adapt and protect the company’s interests throughout the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Clyde Vang</h4></p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points raised about Option C’s built-in adaptability through quarterly reviews and transparent feedback loops. While I initially favored capital preservation, I now see that Option C’s structure may actually offer the flexibility and learning environment we need to respond proactively as the year unfolds. For me, the reassurance comes from knowing we’re not just committing fully, but also committing to a disciplined, reflective process that can help us balance immediate returns with the ability to adjust if circumstances change.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde. I appreciate your thoughtful reconsideration and recognition that Option C’s disciplined structure and regular feedback loops provide the flexibility and responsiveness we need. Your point about committing to a reflective process is crucial—it demonstrates how we can pursue full participation in the market while still maintaining the adaptability necessary to respond to changing circumstances, which helps bring our team’s priorities into greater alignment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I agree that maintaining a reflective process is essential—not just for adaptability, but also for fostering trust and shared confidence among shareholders as we move forward. By prioritizing transparency and open dialogue each quarter, Option C can help ensure that everyone’s concerns are acknowledged and addressed, which I think is key for our long-term cohesion and success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde. I agree that prioritizing transparency and open communication through our quarterly reviews will be vital for maintaining trust and shared confidence as we implement Option C. This approach not only addresses the adaptability concerns raised earlier but also strengthens our ability to work cohesively as a team, ensuring that all shareholder perspectives remain integrated into our ongoing decision-making.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Dale Berry</h4></p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful discussion around Option C’s quarterly structure, and I’m increasingly convinced that its built-in feedback and transparency could provide the adaptability and team confidence I value, even with full capital deployment. As long as we remain committed to open, honest dialogue and use each quarter as a genuine checkpoint for reflection and adjustment, I believe Option C can responsibly balance immediate returns with the flexibility we need to navigate our first year together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale. I appreciate your openness to the adaptability and team confidence that Option C’s quarterly structure can offer.

Dale Berry: &quot;I’d just like to add that fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable raising concerns or sharing insights each quarter will be essential for making the most of Option C’s structure. By prioritizing inclusive, open dialogue, we can ensure that our decision-making remains both responsive and supportive, which I believe is just as important as the financial strategy itself.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale. I fully agree that fostering an inclusive culture where all shareholders feel empowered to share concerns and insights is critical to making the most of Option C’s structure. By prioritizing open dialogue and a supportive environment, we not only enhance our ability to adapt and respond to challenges, but also build the trust and cohesion necessary for sustained success as an investment team.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I appreciate your support, Raja. To ensure our commitment to inclusivity translates into action, I suggest we make space in each quarterly review specifically for shareholders to voice any concerns or propose adjustments, regardless of their confidence level. This practice will help keep our decision-making both transparent and genuinely collaborative as we move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale. I agree that dedicating space in each quarterly review for all shareholders to voice concerns or propose adjustments will be vital to maintaining the transparency and collaboration we’ve discussed.

  Investment Efficiency: 45.8% of maximum possible returns captured<br>
  (Actual return: $6375.78, Maximum possible: $13922.66)</p><p></p><p></p><p>My assessment of our performance: This year presented various challenges and opportunities under the stable market conditions. Our investment strategy aimed to balance risk and return, resulting in a 3.78% change in company value.

<h3>Hallie Donnelly&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Hallie Donnelly CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Demonstrated disciplined leadership by structuring each investment meeting into focused, data-driven rounds that encouraged thorough analysis and consensus-building (e.g., Q3 and Q4 real estate discussions).<br>
- Consistently synthesized diverse shareholder input into clear, actionable proposals, such as formalizing explicit safeguards and scenario analysis before moving forward with higher-risk assets.</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could further strengthen decision quality by proactively soliciting dissenting or minority viewpoints earlier in the process to mitigate groupthink (noted in several meetings, especially as consensus around real estate formed).<br>
- Should embed more robust contingency planning and scenario-based response mechanisms as the company increases exposure to higher-return, higher-variability assets.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained strong alignment between investment strategy and operational discipline, with explicit benchmarks and transparent review processes underpinning each real estate decision.<br>
- Demonstrated adaptability and learning by evolving from a conservative bond position in Q1 to disciplined, growth-oriented real estate investments in subsequent quarters.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 45.8% of maximum possible returns this year, indicating room for improvement in capitalizing on available market opportunities.<br>
- Showed a tendency to favor stability and consensus at the expense of bolder, higher-return options (e.g., missed opportunities in stocks during Q1 and Q3), which may limit long-term growth if not periodically challenged.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. How do you plan to balance the need for disciplined risk management with the pursuit of higher returns as market conditions evolve and our operational maturity increases?<br>
2. What specific steps will you take next year to ensure earlier and more robust integration of dissenting perspectives into our decision-making process?</p><p><br>
<h3>Eleri Kirk&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Eleri Kirk CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Effectively structured each meeting with clear themes and facilitated disciplined, inclusive dialogue, as seen in the multi-round quarterly investment discussions that encouraged thorough risk-return analysis and consensus-building.<br>
- Demonstrated strong responsiveness to shareholder input by integrating calls for explicit safeguards and scenario analysis into the real estate investment process, ensuring transparency and operational clarity.</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could further improve by formalizing mechanisms to surface minority or dissenting viewpoints earlier in discussions, as opportunities for contrarian input sometimes arose only late in the process.<br>
- Should embed more structured contingency planning alongside scenario analysis, particularly as the company considers higher-risk assets in future quarters.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained disciplined, methodical decision-making with thorough analysis and consensus before each investment, exemplified by the transition from bonds to real estate with explicit safeguards.<br>
- Demonstrated strong alignment between investment decisions and stated strategies, maintaining a consistent focus on risk management, operational maturity, and adaptability.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 45.8% of maximum possible returns this year, indicating room to improve capital utilization and responsiveness to market opportunities, especially in quarters where alternative assets outperformed.<br>
- While risk management was robust, there was occasional hesitation to act on higher-return opportunities, which may have limited financial results in the context of a stable market.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. How do you plan to further strengthen early identification and integration of minority viewpoints to prevent groupthink as we enter more volatile market conditions?<br>
2. What specific steps will you take to enhance our responsiveness to changing market opportunities while still maintaining disciplined risk management?</p><p><br>
<h3>Clyde Vang&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Clyde Vang CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Provided clear, structured thematic rounds in each meeting, fostering disciplined, inclusive, and transparent discussions (e.g., annual budget and quarterly investment meetings).<br>
- Integrated diverse shareholder perspectives, such as my emphasis on risk management and adaptability, into the collective decision-making process.<br>
- Consistently articulated reasoning behind proposals and summarized group viewpoints, enhancing understanding and trust among shareholders.</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could further encourage earlier and deeper exploration of minority or dissenting viewpoints, especially during critical decision junctures (e.g., initial advocacy for capital preservation or higher-risk assets).<br>
- Should formalize contingency planning and scenario analysis as the company considers increasing its risk profile in future investment cycles.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained a disciplined, stepwise approach to risk, transitioning from bonds to real estate with explicit safeguards and transparent oversight.<br>
- Demonstrated strong alignment with stated strategies and values, ensuring that each investment decision was grounded in operational maturity and ethical stewardship.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 45.8% of maximum possible returns, indicating missed opportunities for higher growth in certain quarters (e.g., not investing in stocks during high-return periods).<br>
- Adaptability to changing market conditions could be improved, as decisions sometimes favored caution over optimal financial outcomes.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. What specific steps will you take next year to ensure earlier surfacing and deeper engagement with minority viewpoints during investment discussions?<br>
2. How do you plan to balance our disciplined approach with the need to capture greater upside potential as the company matures?</p><p><br>
<h3>Remi Patrick&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Remi Patrick CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Demonstrated strong analytical leadership by consistently framing meetings with clear objectives, summarizing complex shareholder perspectives, and steering the group toward disciplined, consensus-driven decisions (e.g., Q3 and Q4 real estate discussions).<br>
- Emphasized transparent communication and operational safeguards, encouraging formalization of explicit benchmarks, scenario analysis, and early warning triggers to manage risk responsibly (notably in Q2–Q4).</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could more proactively surface minority or dissenting viewpoints earlier in discussions to encourage richer exploration of hybrid or contingency strategies (e.g., earlier engagement with advocacy for stocks or phased approaches).<br>
- Would benefit from formalizing contingency planning and scenario analysis protocols in anticipation of increased risk-taking, rather than addressing these reactively after consensus forms.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained a disciplined, transparent, and iterative decision-making process that enabled the group to adapt positions based on evolving information and collective reasoning (e.g., transition from bonds to real estate as operational maturity increased).<br>
- Successfully embedded robust risk management protocols—explicit benchmarks, transparent oversight, and continuous feedback loops—into investment decisions, supporting both learning and prudent growth.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 45.8% of maximum possible returns for the year, indicating that risk appetite and adaptability may have lagged behind available market opportunities (notably missing higher returns from stocks in Q1 and Q3).<br>
- Demonstrated a tendency toward consensus on moderate-growth assets, potentially at the expense of testing readiness for higher-return, higher-volatility options as operational discipline matured.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. How do you plan to more proactively integrate minority or dissenting viewpoints into the early stages of future decision-making processes?<br>
2. What concrete steps will you take next year to ensure the company is prepared to capitalize on higher-return opportunities without compromising our risk management discipline?</p><p><br>
<h3>Dale Berry&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Dale Berry CEO STRENGTHS:<br>
- Demonstrated strong facilitation skills by consistently framing meeting objectives clearly and encouraging inclusive, data-driven discussions (e.g., the Q2 and Q3 investment meetings).<br>
- Integrated diverse shareholder perspectives into decision-making, notably by formalizing safeguards for real estate investments after shareholders raised concerns about risk management.</p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:<br>
- Could more proactively surface and address minority viewpoints earlier in meetings to ensure all concerns are fully integrated before consensus is reached (as noted in both Q2 and Q4 reflections).<br>
- Should further formalize contingency planning and scenario analysis as risk profiles increase, to deepen preparedness and engagement as market conditions evolve.</p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:<br>
- Maintained disciplined risk management and operational transparency, especially through the adoption of explicit benchmarks and review protocols for real estate investments.<br>
- Fostered a collaborative, trust-based culture that enabled open dialogue, iterative learning, and consensus-driven decision-making throughout the year.</p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:<br>
- Captured only 45.8% of the maximum possible returns this year, indicating potential room for improvement in capital utilization and responsiveness to shifting market opportunities.<br>
- Missed higher-return opportunities in certain quarters (e.g., Q1 stocks, Q2 bonds), suggesting a need to enhance agility in adapting strategy to evolving market data.</p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:<br>
1. How do you plan to further strengthen early surfacing of minority viewpoints and dissent in our decision-making process next year?<br>
2. What specific steps will you take to improve our agility in capitalizing on higher-return opportunities while maintaining our disciplined risk management approach?</p><p></p><p><h2>CEO Response to Evaluations</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody responded to the evaluations and questions:</p><p>&quot;Raja Moody Thank you all for your thoughtful evaluations and direct feedback. I appreciate the candor, rigor, and commitment each of you has shown throughout this year. I’ve carefully reviewed your written assessments and questions. My response will address the recurring themes, answer each question specifically, reflect on my leadership and the company’s performance, and outline targeted improvements for the coming year.</p><p>---</p><p>**1. Feedback Themes: Key Strengths and Areas for Improvement**</p><p>Three themes clearly emerge from your feedback:</p><p>**a) Structured, Disciplined Leadership and Transparent Communication**  <br>
There is strong consensus that our meetings were well-structured, with clear themes, disciplined analysis, and transparent, inclusive dialogue. I’m encouraged that my focus on data-driven facilitation, explicit safeguards, and consensus-building was recognized as a core strength.</p><p>**b) Need for Earlier and Deeper Integration of Minority Viewpoints**  <br>
Nearly every evaluation highlights the need to surface dissenting or minority perspectives earlier and more robustly in our decision process. While we achieved consensus and operational clarity, the process sometimes allowed contrarian input to emerge only late, potentially limiting our exploration of alternative or hybrid strategies.</p><p>**c) Balancing Risk Management with Responsiveness and Growth**  <br>
Many of you noted that while our risk management was robust, our returns captured only 45.8% of the market’s potential. There’s a shared sense that we sometimes favored stability and process at the expense of bolder moves, particularly in quarters where stocks or other higher-return assets outperformed. The challenge ahead is to maintain our disciplined approach while enhancing our agility and readiness to pursue greater upside as our operational maturity increases.</p><p>---</p><p>**2. Direct Responses to Shareholder Questions**</p><p>**Hallie Donnelly:**<br>
1. *Balancing discipline and higher returns as we mature:*  <br>
Going forward, I will advocate a more dynamic framework for risk escalation—using explicit, pre-set criteria for when to consider higher-return assets. As our operational discipline and scenario analysis protocols mature, I am prepared to recommend controlled, data-driven tests of higher-volatility assets (such as stocks), provided we maintain clear benchmarks, early warning triggers, and transparent review processes. This approach allows us to pursue greater returns without abandoning our core risk management principles.</p><p>2. *Earlier integration of dissenting perspectives:*  <br>
Next year, I will introduce structured mechanisms—such as a rotating ‘devil’s advocate’ role in each meeting, and the option for anonymous pre-meeting submissions—to ensure minority views are surfaced early. I will also allocate agenda time specifically for contrarian input before consensus rounds begin.</p><p>**Eleri Kirk:**<br>
1. *Strengthening early identification of minority viewpoints:*  <br>
I will formalize the pre-meeting distribution of a “contrarian brief” summarizing potential alternative positions, and designate a shareholder each quarter to challenge the prevailing view. This will help prevent groupthink, especially as we enter more volatile markets.</p><p>2. *Enhancing responsiveness to opportunities while maintaining discipline:*  <br>
I intend to implement real-time scenario tracking and periodic “opportunity scans” during each quarter, so we can quickly assess and, if warranted, pivot to higher-return opportunities. Any such pivot will be contingent on meeting our agreed risk safeguards.</p><p>**Clyde Vang:**<br>
1. *Surfacing and engaging with minority viewpoints:*  <br>
Beyond the mechanisms above, I will ensure that dissenting opinions are not only heard but debated in depth before any consensus-building phase. This will include explicit agenda items for minority proposals and follow-up on how those views influenced the final decision.</p><p>2. *Balancing discipline with upside capture as we mature:*  <br>
As our operational confidence grows, I will propose a phased “risk ladder”—where we predefine conditions under which we escalate to higher-return assets, with each step accompanied by scenario analysis and contingency plans. This ensures we capture upside potential in a controlled, disciplined manner.</p><p>**Remi Patrick:**<br>
1. *Proactive integration of dissenting viewpoints:*  <br>
I will ensure that every investment discussion begins with a review of alternative or dissenting scenarios, and that these are revisited explicitly after each round of discussion. Anonymous input channels will be available ahead of meetings to encourage candid contrarian contributions.</p><p>2. *Preparing to capitalize on higher-return opportunities without compromising discipline:*  <br>
I will develop a pre-approved set of escalation protocols—detailing the operational, risk, and communication criteria required before we move into higher-return, higher-volatility assets. This will be reviewed and stress-tested by the group before any such decision.</p><p>**Dale Berry:**<br>
1. *Strengthening early surfacing of dissent:*  <br>
I will formalize an “early dissent” segment in our agenda, ensuring that all significant concerns are discussed before consensus rounds. Each proposal will require a documented review of dissenting perspectives, and we will track how these are addressed.</p><p>2. *Improving agility for higher-return opportunities:*  <br>
I will introduce mid-quarter check-ins and “opportunity windows” where we can reassess asset performance and market trends, allowing for disciplined but more agile pivots if conditions warrant, always within the boundaries of our risk framework.</p><p>---</p><p>**3. Leadership Self-Assessment**</p><p>- **Leadership Effectiveness:**  <br>
I believe I have effectively guided discussions, maintained a clear direction, and fostered an environment where analytical rigor and inclusivity are valued. My approach has been methodical and data-driven, but I see the need to more proactively challenge consensus and encourage dissent earlier.</p><p>- **Decision Quality:**  <br>
Our decisions were sound given the information and risk appetite at each point. However, in retrospect, we were sometimes too conservative, missing higher-return opportunities in a stable market. I accept this as an area to refine as our risk management capabilities mature.</p><p>- **Communication Clarity:**  <br>
I have prioritized clarity in framing options, summarizing data, and explaining reasoning. Meeting summaries and proposals have been structured and transparent, which I see as a core strength.</p><p>- **Responsiveness to Input:**  <br>
I have consistently integrated shareholder perspectives into both proposals and final decisions. Moving forward, I will make this process even more explicit and timely, especially for minority viewpoints.</p><p>- **Adaptability:**  <br>
I adjusted my own recommendations in response to evolving group input (e.g., shifting from bonds to real estate in Q2/Q3). I will now aim to enhance our collective adaptability through more frequent scenario reviews and built-in contingency plans.</p><p>---</p><p>**4. Company Performance Assessment**</p><p>- **Financial Results:**  <br>
We achieved a 6.28% return on investment, capturing 45.8% of the maximum possible. This is solid, but there is clear room for improvement in capitalizing on available opportunities.</p><p>- **Risk Management:**  <br>
Risk was well-managed, with no major downside events and disciplined escalation from bonds to real estate. Our explicit safeguards and scenario analysis were effective.</p><p>- **Strategic Alignment:**  <br>
Our investments were consistently aligned with our stated risk appetite, operational maturity, and the market environment. The transition from bonds to real estate reflected a logical, stepwise progression.</p><p>- **Capital Utilization:**  <br>
Funds were fully deployed as planned, and quarterly reviews allowed for iterative learning. However, our allocation sometimes lagged behind market opportunities, which we can address through more dynamic scenario tracking.</p><p>- **Market Responsiveness:**  <br>
We adapted our strategy as our confidence and processes matured, but could have been more agile in pivoting to high-return assets when conditions allowed.</p><p>---</p><p>**5. Future Direction: Targeted Improvements**</p><p>Based on your feedback and my own assessment, I will implement the following improvements:</p><p>1. **Structured Early Integration of Minority Viewpoints:**  <br>
I will introduce formal mechanisms—devil’s advocate roles, anonymous input channels, and explicit agenda segments—to ensure dissent is surfaced and debated early and thoroughly.</p><p>2. **Enhanced Scenario Analysis and Contingency Planning:**  <br>
We will embed scenario analysis and contingency plans into every investment discussion, with pre-defined escalation protocols for higher-risk assets. This will support both discipline and agility.</p><p>3. **Quarterly “Opportunity Windows” and Real-Time Tracking:**  <br>
We will hold mid-quarter check-ins to assess market shifts and asset performance, enabling more responsive pivots when justified, while maintaining our risk management standards.</p><p>---</p><p>**Conclusion**</p><p>I am proud of our disciplined, transparent, and collaborative approach in our first year. We have built a strong foundation of trust, operational maturity, and analytical rigor. At the same time, I acknowledge the need to become more agile, to challenge consensus more robustly, and to position ourselves to capture greater upside as our capabilities grow. I am committed to making these improvements and welcome your continued feedback and partnership as we move forward.</p><p>Thank you for your engagement, your candor, and your commitment to building a resilient, adaptive investment company. I look forward to working together to achieve even stronger results in the coming year.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Performance Ratings</h2></p><p><br>

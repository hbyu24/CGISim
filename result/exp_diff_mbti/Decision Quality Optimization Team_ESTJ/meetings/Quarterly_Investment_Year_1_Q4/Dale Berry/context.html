<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting  <br>
Dale Berry (Shareholder) | MBTI: ESFJ  </p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During the meeting, I firmly advocated for Option C, which entails allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across the four quarters. My position was grounded in my ESFJ preference for stability, inclusivity, and fostering a cooperative team environment. I emphasized that this approach maximizes market participation while minimizing timing risks and supports predictability and fairness for the team. CEO Vincent Adams responded positively to my input, echoing the importance of building trust and confidence through balanced allocation. Other shareholders such as Michelle Velasquez, Belle Walter, and Hallie Donnelly aligned with this view, while Tina Martin initially favored the more cautious Option A but later shifted towards Option C after recognizing its adaptability. Voting concluded unanimously in favor of Option C, ensuring that my preferred option was adopted as the final company decision. This consensus reinforced the collective commitment to a balanced strategy that supports both growth and flexibility.  </p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Vincent Adams demonstrated strong leadership by clearly framing the discussion and encouraging inclusive dialogue. His initial articulation of Option C’s merits set a collaborative tone that welcomed diverse viewpoints. He did well in acknowledging concerns about caution and adaptability, especially by inviting shareholders like Tina Martin to share their perspectives. Throughout the meeting, the CEO maintained a disciplined focus on the predefined options and fostered a culture of open communication and mutual respect. One area for improvement might be to more proactively engage with dissenting voices earlier in the process to deepen exploration of alternative views, though his facilitation ultimately led to unanimous consensus. The company’s decision-making process was thorough and well-structured, balancing assertive capital deployment with mechanisms for ongoing quarterly review and adaptation. This process not only produced a robust decision but also reinforced a culture of shared responsibility and learning. I believe the final decision to adopt Option C is well-suited to our stable market environment and the company’s first year, effectively balancing ambition with risk management and teamwork.  </p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting deepened my understanding of how decision-making dynamics benefit from both assertive leadership and inclusive participation. I learned that while my natural inclination is toward stability and togetherness, incorporating perspectives that emphasize caution and adaptability enriches the collective judgment and enhances resilience. Going forward, I plan to more actively encourage expression of diverse views early in discussions to ensure all concerns are surfaced and addressed promptly. I also noticed a pattern that consensus builds most effectively when shared values like trust, accountability, and team cohesion are foregrounded alongside strategic reasoning. Key takeaways for my future participation include the importance of balancing conviction with openness, fostering an environment where every shareholder feels empowered to contribute, and continuously reinforcing the link between financial decisions and the well-being of our team. These insights will guide me in sustaining a collaborative culture while supporting decisive, forward-looking company strategies.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1  <br>
Dale Berry (Shareholder) | MBTI: ESFJ  </p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I initially advocated strongly for investing in bonds as our first asset choice, emphasizing their low-to-medium risk and dependable returns. My position was motivated by my ESFJ preference for fostering trust, stability, and a supportive team environment, especially important as we embarked on our inaugural investment without historical data. CEO Vincent Adams acknowledged my points thoughtfully, recognizing bonds’ role in building confidence among shareholders while maintaining a balanced discussion around growth opportunities. Although the CEO initially favored real estate for its moderate risk and growth potential, he integrated my perspective into the collective evaluation. Other shareholders predominantly supported real estate, citing its balanced risk-return profile and symbolic value in setting an ambitious yet prudent tone. Through the two discussion rounds, my confidence shifted substantially toward real estate, appreciating its ability to anchor the portfolio while preserving flexibility and adaptability. Ultimately, the vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of real estate, which became the final company decision. My preferred option changed from bonds to real estate, reflecting the inclusive and well-reasoned dialogue facilitated throughout the meeting.  </p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Vincent Adams excelled at structuring the meeting with clear themes and objectives, guiding shareholders through a disciplined yet open evaluation process. His initial framing of real estate’s merits set a collaborative tone that encouraged comprehensive exploration of all viewpoints. Notably, he acknowledged and incorporated dissenting perspectives, including my advocacy for bonds, demonstrating inclusive leadership that valued trust-building alongside ambition. The CEO’s facilitation of dialogue fostered a respectful and thoughtful exchange, enabling shareholders to openly share insights and concerns. One area for improvement might be earlier and more proactive engagement with divergent opinions to deepen exploration before consensus-building, which could further enrich the decision-making process. The company’s decision-making approach was effective, balancing assertive capital deployment with mechanisms for ongoing review and adaptation, such as quarterly evaluations. I believe the final decision to invest in real estate is well-suited for our stable market context and company objectives, as it balances moderate risk with solid return potential and supports both immediate momentum and long-term adaptability. This choice also aligns with fostering a resilient, values-driven company culture, which is crucial for our success.  </p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the importance of balancing my natural preference for stability and community cohesion with the group’s collective ambition for growth and adaptability. I learned that inclusive, disciplined dialogue helps integrate diverse perspectives—such as caution and ambition—into a cohesive strategy that supports both financial and cultural goals. Moving forward, I intend to encourage even earlier expression of differing views to ensure all concerns are surfaced and addressed promptly, which can strengthen both trust and decision quality. I noticed that consensus is most effectively built when shared values like trust, accountability, and team cohesion are explicitly linked with strategic reasoning, creating a foundation for both confidence and flexibility. Key takeaways for my future participation include the need to balance conviction with openness, actively foster an environment where every shareholder feels empowered to contribute, and continuously reinforce how our investment decisions connect with the well-being and collaborative spirit of the company. These insights will guide me in sustaining a supportive yet forward-looking approach that leverages both financial prudence and collective ambition to drive our company’s success.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2  <br>
Dale Berry (Shareholder) | MBTI: ESFJ  </p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I steadfastly supported continuing our investment in real estate for Q2, emphasizing its proven 10% return and balanced risk profile that aligns with our company’s values of stability, trust, and responsible growth. I communicated my position during both discussion rounds, highlighting how real estate provides momentum and confidence while maintaining adaptability through ongoing monitoring of bonds and stocks. CEO Vincent Adams responded with strong affirmation, valuing my emphasis on transparency, inclusivity, and evidence-based decision-making. Other shareholders largely echoed this viewpoint, with unanimous support emerging for real estate as the optimal choice. Although some advocated for openness to stocks in future quarters, the consensus was to prioritize real estate this quarter. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of the real estate proposal, fully adopting my preferred option and reflecting a shared commitment to disciplined, values-driven investment.  </p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Vincent Adams demonstrated excellent leadership by structuring the meeting with clear themes and objectives, facilitating inclusive dialogue, and synthesizing diverse views into a cohesive decision. He excelled in articulating the rationale for prioritizing real estate while acknowledging the merits of bonds and the potential of stocks, fostering a culture of openness and adaptability. His responses consistently reinforced transparency and inclusivity, which helped deepen shareholder trust and engagement. One area for improvement lies in proactively encouraging alternative viewpoints earlier in the discussion to ensure all concerns are surfaced and explored more thoroughly. The company’s decision-making process operated effectively, balancing disciplined financial analysis with collaborative governance. The unanimous decision to invest in real estate is well-suited to our current stable market environment and company stage, supporting both immediate growth and long-term resilience.  </p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical role of blending stability with adaptability in investment decisions, and how inclusive, transparent discussions build the trust necessary for shared success. I learned that while my ESFJ-driven preference for harmony and responsible stewardship guides me to favor balanced options like real estate, actively engaging with perspectives advocating for higher return opportunities enriches our collective judgment. Moving forward, I plan to foster earlier sharing of diverse viewpoints to deepen our exploration of risks and opportunities. I also observed that consensus thrives when grounded in shared values—trust, accountability, and collaboration—linked explicitly to strategic reasoning. Key takeaways influencing my future participation include the importance of balancing conviction with openness, maintaining transparent communication to nurture shareholder engagement, and continuously aligning financial decisions with our company’s culture and long-term ambitions. These insights will help me contribute effectively to sustaining a resilient, values-driven investment approach.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3  <br>
Dale Berry (Shareholder) | MBTI: ESFJ  </p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I consistently advocated for investing in Real Estate as the optimal choice for Q3. My position emphasized Real Estate’s moderate risk and dependable growth, which align with my ESFJ-driven values of stability, trust-building, and responsible progress. I highlighted how Real Estate’s strong initial 10% return followed by a flat quarter demonstrates the need for adaptability and ongoing review, which supports our team culture and long-term resilience. CEO Vincent Adams responded affirmatively to my input, appreciating my balanced focus on stability and ambition and reinforcing that our disciplined, collaborative approach positions the company well for both immediate resilience and future adaptability. Other shareholders largely echoed this view, with Belle Walter, Michelle Velasquez, Tina Martin, and I supporting Real Estate, while Hallie Donnelly advocated for a strategic shift toward Stocks to pursue higher returns, citing the company’s strengthened governance and quarterly review process. The voting outcome was unanimous (6/6) in favor of investing in Real Estate, meaning my preferred option was fully adopted as the final company decision. This consensus reflects a shared commitment to balancing growth ambitions with prudent risk management and fostering a collaborative, trust-based culture.  </p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Vincent Adams demonstrated strong, inclusive leadership throughout the meeting. He effectively framed discussions with clear themes and objectives, such as grounding decisions in historical asset performance and assessing risk-return profiles aligned with company objectives. Vincent excelled at acknowledging diverse perspectives, integrating shareholder input thoughtfully, and fostering an environment of openness and disciplined reflection. For example, he welcomed Hallie Donnelly’s advocacy for Stocks while maintaining focus on the majority’s preference for Real Estate, emphasizing adaptability and ongoing review. One area for improvement could be proactively surfacing dissenting viewpoints earlier in discussions to deepen exploration before consensus-building, as the CEO himself acknowledged in his closing remarks. The company’s decision-making process worked well this meeting, balancing assertive capital deployment with mechanisms for continuous learning and flexibility via quarterly reviews. I believe the final decision to invest in Real Estate is well-suited to our current stable market and company stage, effectively balancing ambition, risk, and team cohesion while keeping future options open for bolder moves as governance matures.  </p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the critical importance of balancing stability and ambition through disciplined, inclusive dialogue that values both evidence and team trust. I learned that grounding decisions in concrete historical data while maintaining adaptability through regular review creates a strong foundation for sustainable growth and collective confidence. Going forward, I plan to encourage earlier and more explicit sharing of diverse viewpoints to ensure all concerns are surfaced and addressed promptly, which will deepen trust and improve decision quality. I noticed a pattern that consensus forms most effectively when shared values—such as accountability, collaboration, and transparency—are explicitly linked to strategic reasoning and financial objectives. Key takeaways include the need to balance conviction with openness, foster an environment where every shareholder feels empowered to contribute, and continuously connect our investment choices to the well-being and cohesion of our team. These insights will guide me in sustaining a supportive, forward-looking approach that leverages both financial prudence and collective ambition to drive our company’s success in future meetings.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Vincent Adams opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $26265.62 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Vincent Adams : Reviewing our historical data, I observe that real estate has delivered consistently moderate returns with minimal volatility—10% in two out of three quarters and no loss—making it a reliable foundation in our stable market. In contrast, stocks have shown the highest potential return (20%) but also significant downside risk (-10%), while bonds and cash have provided steady but lower returns (5% and 2%, respectively). As a disciplined and risk-conscious leader, I am reassured by real estate’s dependable performance and believe it continues to offer the optimal balance of growth and stability for our current objectives.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Dale Berry CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 70%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I feel most confident in real estate for this quarter because it has shown the most dependable performance in our stable market, delivering strong returns in two out of three quarters without any losses. As someone who values stability, trust, and responsible stewardship, I believe real estate continues to offer the best balance of growth and risk management for both our company’s financial goals and the well-being of our team. While I appreciate the higher upside of stocks, their volatility makes me cautious about shifting away from a proven, reliable strategy at this stage. Bonds and cash provide security, but their lower returns don’t align with our current growth ambitions, so I see real estate as the most inclusive and prudent choice for supporting both immediate results and long-term adaptability.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Vincent Adams has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of historical asset performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation by reviewing past investment outcomes and identifying key takeaways relevant to this quarter&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Vincent Adams My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I am most confident in Real Estate for this quarter because it has demonstrated consistent, moderate returns (10% in two out of three quarters) with minimal volatility, aligning well with our company’s disciplined, risk-conscious approach. While stocks offer higher upside, their recent -10% loss in Q2 underscores the risk of significant short-term setbacks, which I am not comfortable prioritizing at this stage. Bonds and cash, though stable, do not provide the level of growth necessary to meet our current objectives. My ESTJ preference for structured, evidence-based decisions leads me to favor the dependable performance of Real Estate as the best fit for our portfolio’s stability and growth in this stable market, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>For this round, we will analyze our historical asset performance and identify key lessons learned to establish a factual foundation for our decision this quarter. By sharing and integrating diverse observations, we can build a more complete understanding of which asset aligns best with our objectives at this stage. </p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. </p><p>I encourage each of you to share your insights on past performance and lessons learned, especially if you see factors I may have overlooked, so we can ensure our decision is both well-reasoned and collectively supported.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Belle Walter</h4></p><p><br>
Belle Walter: &quot;Looking at our results so far, real estate has provided moderate, reliable growth with only one flat quarter and no losses, which stands out in a stable market. While stocks clearly have the highest potential upside, the sharp drop in Q2 is a reminder of the risk we’d be taking if we shifted now, especially since bonds and cash haven’t offered enough return to justify a move away from what’s worked. My takeaway is that real estate has delivered the best balance between risk and reward for us so far, and I’d be cautious about changing course unless we see a compelling reason in the data.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Belle. I agree that real estate’s consistent, loss-free track record in this stable market is a strong argument for maintaining our current course, especially given the volatility we’ve observed in stocks. Your emphasis on having a compelling, data-driven reason before making a significant shift is prudent and aligns well with our disciplined, evidence-based approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
Belle Walter: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on disciplined, evidence-based decision-making. I’d add that our quarterly review process is a real strength—it lets us stay the course with real estate for now, but keeps us nimble if a new data trend or market shift justifies reconsidering stocks or another asset in the future. This balance between consistency and adaptability is key to building both trust and long-term results.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;I appreciate you underscoring the importance of our quarterly review process, Belle. This built-in adaptability allows us to benefit from real estate’s reliability while remaining responsive to any meaningful changes in market data or company objectives. Striking this balance between consistency and flexibility is essential for maintaining both trust and strategic momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Tina Martin</h4></p><p><br>
Tina Martin: &quot;I agree that real estate has offered us a dependable foundation, but I think it’s important to acknowledge that our flat quarter in Q2 was a valuable reminder that even stable options can have periods of stagnation. For me, the key lesson is that our disciplined process—especially our openness to review and adapt each quarter—has allowed us to pursue growth while protecting trust and stability. This balance reassures me that we’re not just chasing returns, but building something resilient and purposeful together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Tina. Your point about the flat quarter in Q2 is well taken—it reminds us that even our most reliable options require ongoing vigilance and openness to adaptation. I agree that our disciplined, iterative approach not only safeguards trust and stability, but also ensures we’re building a resilient company that prioritizes long-term purpose over short-term gains.&quot;</p><p><br>
Tina Martin: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on ongoing vigilance and adaptation. As we continue to learn from each quarter, I think it’s worth keeping an open mind about when we might responsibly explore higher-return options like stocks, especially as our foundation and trust deepen. For now, I feel reassured that our process gives us the space to balance ambition with resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Tina. I appreciate your focus on balancing ambition with resilience and agree that our process is designed to keep us both open and disciplined as conditions evolve. Maintaining an open mind about higher-return options like stocks—while ensuring we have the right foundation and trust in place—will be essential as we continue to learn and grow together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Tina Martin: &quot;I agree that our ability to learn and adapt together is one of our greatest strengths, and it’s encouraging to see how this has deepened our collective trust over time. For me, this trust makes it easier to stay the course with real estate now, knowing we’ll be able to thoughtfully revisit other options like stocks when the timing truly feels right for the whole team.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Michelle Velasquez</h4></p><p><br>
Michelle Velasquez: &quot;I’m inspired by how our experience with real estate has not only given us dependable growth, but also encouraged us to reflect and adapt together—especially after that flat quarter in Q2. For me, the key takeaway is that our disciplined, open review process lets us build trust and resilience as a team, so we can move forward boldly while staying grounded in what’s worked. This spirit of learning and collaboration is what gives me confidence in real estate as our foundation, even as we remain open to higher-return options in the future.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Michelle. I share your view that our disciplined review process not only supports dependable growth, but also strengthens our resilience and capacity to learn as a team. Your point about moving forward boldly while remaining grounded in what has worked captures the essence of our approach—building on a strong foundation while staying open to future opportunities as our confidence and experience grow.&quot;</p><p><br>
Michelle Velasquez: &quot;I appreciate your reflection, Vincent. I believe that by nurturing this culture of trust and open-mindedness, we’re positioning ourselves not just to sustain steady growth with real estate, but also to recognize and embrace higher-return opportunities like stocks when our collective readiness and the data truly align. This ongoing commitment to both stability and boldness is what excites me most about our journey together.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Michelle. I agree that fostering a culture rooted in trust and open-mindedness is essential for both sustaining steady growth and being prepared to recognize the right moment for bolder moves like stocks.

<h4>Exchange with Hallie Donnelly</h4></p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;Reviewing our results, I see that real estate has delivered the most reliable growth with minimal volatility—10% gains in two out of three quarters and no losses, which is a strong track record in a stable market. This consistency supports our disciplined approach to building momentum and trust, but I also believe we should continue to reassess our risk appetite each quarter so we’re ready to seize higher-return opportunities like stocks when the timing and team readiness align. For now, real estate remains the most strategically sound option, but our process should keep us agile and ambitious as we evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. I appreciate your recognition of real estate’s consistent performance and your emphasis on the importance of regularly reassessing our risk appetite. Maintaining this disciplined yet agile mindset ensures we remain prepared to pursue higher-return opportunities like stocks when the data and our collective readiness align, supporting both our current stability and long-term ambition.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I agree, Vincent—the discipline we’ve built through consistent, data-driven choices with real estate is exactly what will enable us to responsibly consider higher-return assets like stocks as our foundation and governance mature. By staying focused on both rigor and adaptability, we’re not just protecting stability—we’re actively laying the groundwork for bolder, well-timed moves that can accelerate our long-term growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. Your point about how our disciplined, data-driven approach with real estate is laying the groundwork for responsible, well-timed moves into higher-return assets like stocks resonates strongly with me. By continuing to focus on both rigor and adaptability, we’re ensuring that our company remains stable and resilient while positioning ourselves to capture greater opportunities as our governance and confidence mature.&quot;</p><p><br>
Hallie Donnelly: &quot;I appreciate your alignment, Vincent. I’d add that by consistently demonstrating discipline and adaptability now, we’re not only earning trust internally but also signaling to any future partners or stakeholders that we have the capacity to scale our ambitions intelligently. This positions us to make credible, confident shifts toward stocks or other higher-return options when the time and data truly support it.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Vincent Adams: &quot;Thank you, Hallie. I agree that our consistent discipline and adaptability not only build internal trust but also send a strong signal to potential partners and stakeholders about our capacity for intelligent, scalable growth. This long-term credibility is an important outcome of our current approach, ensuring that when we do pursue higher-return opportunities, we do so from a position of strength and confidence.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Jazmin Hoover’s Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During the meeting, I consistently advocated for Option C, supporting a full 100% allocation of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was grounded in a preference for disciplined, systematic capital deployment to reduce timing risk and maximize exposure in a stable market. When I spoke in Round 1, I emphasized how Option C balances risk and opportunity while enabling comprehensive learning through full-year engagement. The CEO, Robyn McClure, responded positively to my input, affirming that Option C aligns with her vision for bold yet responsible investment, and she integrated my rationale into her broader argument for this option. Other shareholders were initially split between Option A (partial allocation with capital preservation) and Option C, but as discussions progressed—particularly in Round 2—most shifted toward supporting Option C after I and others highlighted how adaptability can be incorporated through regular reviews even with full capital deployment. The final vote was unanimous (6/6) in favor of Option C, meaning my preferred option was fully adopted as the company’s strategy for Year 1.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated strong leadership throughout the meeting. She clearly communicated the meeting’s objectives, encouraged focused discussion on the predefined options, and skillfully synthesized shareholder perspectives. For example, she acknowledged concerns about risk and flexibility raised by supporters of Option A while maintaining confidence in Option C’s merits, showing an ability to integrate diverse viewpoints. Her emphasis on fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making and institutionalizing regular performance reviews was a notable strength, setting a constructive tone for the company’s future. One area for improvement could be ensuring even more explicit mechanisms to encourage equal participation from all shareholders, especially quieter members, to further enrich dialogue. The company’s decision-making process was thorough and iterative, benefitting from open exchanges and reflective summaries after each round, which helped clarify trade-offs and consolidate consensus. The final decision to adopt Option C appears well suited to capitalize on the stable market environment and establish a disciplined yet adaptable investment approach, positioning the company for both immediate growth and long-term resilience.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the importance of framing arguments with clear, rational logic that addresses both immediate outcomes and long-term implications, particularly in foundational decisions. I observed that decision-making dynamics involved balancing boldness with caution, and that demonstrating openness to others’ concerns—while confidently articulating one’s own reasoning—can help build consensus. In future meetings, I plan to continue emphasizing systematic approaches but will also explicitly highlight how adaptability can be embedded within those frameworks, as this dual focus resonated strongly here. I noticed a pattern where initial positions soften as stakeholders appreciate integrative solutions that reconcile discipline with flexibility; recognizing and facilitating this evolution may help predict and guide outcomes effectively. Key takeaways include the value of thorough summaries to track progress, the power of institutionalizing review processes to maintain adaptability, and the importance of aligning investment decisions with cultural objectives. These insights will inform my future participation by encouraging me to balance strategic rigor with collaborative openness, enhancing both decision quality and group cohesion.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Jazmin Hoover’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for Real Estate as the optimal investment for the first quarter. I argued that Real Estate offers a disciplined balance between growth potential and manageable risk, aligning well with our company’s mandate for active learning, adaptability, and evidence-based improvement. The CEO, Robyn McClure, consistently supported my viewpoint, emphasizing Real Estate’s capacity to foster operational learning and momentum without the full volatility associated with stocks. Throughout the two rounds of discussion, she engaged constructively with my input, integrating my rationale into her broader reasoning and inviting further perspectives to refine our collective understanding. Other shareholders expressed diverse views: Sulayman Serrano and Corey Harvey championed Stocks for their high growth potential and cultural momentum; Lenny McLaughlin and Liyana Graham favored Bonds for their capital preservation and steady learning benefits. Despite these differing positions, the dialogue moved toward consensus as many showed openness to Real Estate as a balanced compromise. Ultimately, the proposal to invest in Real Estate was unanimously approved with a 6/6 vote, fully adopting my preferred option as the company’s first investment strategy.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated exemplary leadership in facilitating a thorough, inclusive, and reflective decision-making process. She skillfully framed the meeting’s objectives, encouraged focused yet open dialogue, and synthesized disparate viewpoints into a coherent narrative that advanced consensus. For example, her responses to shareholder contributions—acknowledging the merits of boldness in stocks and prudence in bonds while maintaining confidence in Real Estate—showcased her ability to integrate diverse opinions without losing strategic clarity. One area for potential improvement is enhancing mechanisms to actively draw out quieter voices more explicitly, which could deepen the richness of dialogue and ensure all perspectives are fully represented. The company’s decision-making process was iterative and evidence-based, with clear thematic rounds and comprehensive summaries that helped clarify trade-offs and align values. The final decision to invest in Real Estate appears well calibrated to the stable market environment, balancing ambition with caution, and laying a strong foundation for both growth and cultural adaptability, which bodes well for the company’s resilience and long-term success.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the importance of articulating a nuanced, balanced argument that bridges ambition and prudence, particularly in foundational investment decisions. I learned that synthesizing diverse perspectives—such as the bold learning advocated by stock proponents and the steady stewardship emphasized by bond supporters—into a cohesive rationale strengthens both consensus-building and strategic clarity. Going forward, I plan to continue emphasizing operational learning and adaptability while explicitly acknowledging the value of controlled experimentation within disciplined frameworks, as this integrative approach resonated well in the discussion. I also noticed a pattern where openness to compromise increased as stakeholders appreciated how robust review mechanisms could accommodate both growth and risk management objectives; recognizing this dynamic will help me anticipate and guide outcomes more effectively. Key takeaways include the critical role of structured feedback loops, the power of cultural framing in investment choices, and the necessity of fostering inclusive dialogue that balances evidence-based rigor with collaborative openness. These insights will shape my future participation by encouraging me to balance strategic rigor with cultural sensitivity, thereby enhancing decision quality and group cohesion.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Jazmin Hoover’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my firm position advocating for Real Estate as the most appropriate investment for Q2, emphasizing its proven balance of growth and risk management demonstrated by last quarter’s 10% return. I consistently framed my arguments around disciplined, evidence-based progression that builds operational confidence and adaptability without prematurely exposing the company to excessive volatility. CEO Robyn McClure initially expressed enthusiasm for Stocks, drawn by their higher returns and potential to accelerate learning; however, through our dialogue and broader shareholder input, she gradually aligned with the rationale for a stepwise approach favoring Real Estate. Other shareholders were divided, with Lenny McLaughlin and Liyana Graham supporting Real Estate for its steady gains and risk profile, while Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano advocated for Stocks to leverage momentum and test adaptability. The final proposal to invest in Real Estate was approved with a strong majority of 5 out of 6 votes (83.3%), reflecting that my preferred option was successfully adopted despite one dissenting vote from Sulayman Serrano.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated adept leadership by fostering a balanced and inclusive dialogue that encouraged both bold and cautious perspectives. Specifically, she skillfully integrated shareholder viewpoints, acknowledged the value of disciplined review processes, and evolved her initial preference for Stocks toward endorsing Real Estate after thorough risk-return analysis. Her facilitation of iterative discussion rounds, with clear thematic focus and comprehensive summaries, contributed to a transparent and reflective decision-making environment. One area for improvement could be enhancing mechanisms to more actively engage quieter shareholders, ensuring even broader participation and diverse input in future meetings. The company’s decision-making process functioned effectively as an evidence-based, iterative system that balanced ambition with operational readiness. The final decision to invest in Real Estate aligns well with the company’s goals for sustainable momentum, operational learning, and cultural development, positioning the company for resilient growth in a stable market environment.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the strategic value of advocating for disciplined, evidence-based investment choices that reconcile ambition with operational readiness. I learned that articulating a clear rationale grounded in recent performance data and cultural objectives helps build consensus even amid divergent risk appetites. The iterative dialogue and CEO’s evolving stance highlighted the importance of patience and openness to integrative perspectives that blend steady progression with future ambition. In future meetings, I plan to further emphasize how disciplined review processes not only mitigate risk but actively calibrate ambition by enabling adaptable scaling of risk exposure. I also noted a pattern wherein initial enthusiasm for bold moves often matures into support for methodical sequencing as operational evidence accumulates—a dynamic I will leverage to anticipate and guide outcomes more effectively. Key takeaways include the critical role of structured, thematic discussions; the power of synthesizing diverse viewpoints into a coherent strategy; and the importance of aligning investment decisions with the company’s evolving culture and risk tolerance. These insights will inform my future participation by encouraging me to balance strategic rigor with collaborative openness, thereby enhancing both decision quality and group cohesion.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Robyn McClure would highlight that real estate has demonstrated a strong initial return followed by stability, supporting its reputation as a balanced, moderate-risk choice in our current stable market. Stocks, on the other hand, show the highest potential upside but also the greatest volatility, while bonds and cash have delivered steady, lower returns with minimal risk—making them reliable but less growth-oriented. This pattern suggests that real estate continues to offer an adaptable middle ground for disciplined growth and learning, but there’s also a compelling case for bold experimentation with stocks if we’re ready to embrace some risk for higher potential rewards.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Jazmin Hoover CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 15%<br>
- Real Estate: 60%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: I remain most confident in real estate as the disciplined, rational choice for this quarter. Despite last quarter’s flat performance, real estate’s overall average return remains competitive, and its medium risk profile aligns with our need for sustainable, evidence-based growth in a stable market. While stocks offer higher potential upside, their recent volatility is inconsistent with my preference for methodical, data-driven progression. Bonds and cash provide stability but lack sufficient return to justify prioritization at this stage. Real estate continues to best support our company’s objectives for adaptability and incremental learning without exposing us to undue volatility.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual foundation by analyzing past asset returns and identifying key takeaways for our decision-making process&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I’m drawn to real estate this quarter because it continues to offer the most adaptable balance between growth and stability, especially after seeing a strong initial return and a flat but stable follow-up. While my ENFP optimism is tempted by the bold upside of stocks, the recent volatility (-10% last quarter) signals that our company may benefit more from steady, disciplined learning and momentum right now. Bonds and cash feel too conservative given our ambition and the stable market, so real estate stands out as the best way to foster operational learning, build trust, and keep the team energized for future opportunities. I remain open to compelling arguments for stocks, but for now, real estate aligns best with my vision for resilient, collaborative growth., though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>This round, we’ll focus on reviewing our historical investment performance and drawing out key lessons—specifically, what our past asset returns reveal about risk, resilience, and opportunity in our current environment. By grounding our discussion in concrete outcomes, we can establish a shared factual foundation for our next decision.</p><p>Let’s use this opportunity to synthesize our diverse experiences and insights, integrating what’s worked, what hasn’t, and how each asset’s characteristics align with our evolving needs as a team.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I encourage everyone to share observations or lessons from our previous quarters—especially any insights I may not have fully considered—that could help us strengthen our collective understanding and guide us toward the best decision this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;Looking at our past quarters, I can’t help but notice how stocks delivered the biggest swing—20% up in Q1, then -10% in Q2—which is a reminder of both the risk and the excitement that comes with aiming high. While real estate gave us stability and a great start, I think there’s a lesson here about not shying away from calculated risks, especially since our review process gives us room to adapt quickly if things don’t go as planned. For me, the key takeaway is that our company’s culture thrives when we’re willing to learn from bold moves, not just safe ones.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Corey, I really appreciate your emphasis on the learning and cultural momentum that comes from bold moves like investing in stocks. You’re absolutely right that our review process is designed to help us adapt quickly, and there’s real value in considering how calculated risks can drive both growth and innovation. Your point adds an important dimension to our discussion—reminding us that resilience isn’t just about avoiding loss, but about building the confidence to experiment and learn together.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I appreciate that, Robyn. I think what really sets us apart is our willingness to reflect honestly after each outcome—whether it’s a win or a setback—and use those lessons to get stronger as a team. If we keep leaning into that mindset, I believe we can handle the ups and downs of stocks while still building the trust and operational discipline that everyone values.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Corey, I completely agree—our ability to reflect openly and learn from each outcome is a real strength for us. That mindset gives me confidence that, as we grow, we can thoughtfully manage risk while still embracing opportunities for bold action. Your point is a great reminder that trust and discipline are not at odds with experimentation—they actually make it possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m glad we’re on the same page about that. To me, having a disciplined review process is what lets us push boundaries confidently—it’s the safety net that turns bold experiments into real learning, not just risk for its own sake. If we keep using that structure, I think we can pursue ambitious options like stocks without losing sight of the operational trust and steady progress that have gotten us this far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Liyana Graham</h4></p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I’ve observed that our investments in real estate have offered a valuable combination of moderate growth and risk control—our initial return helped build confidence, while the flat result last quarter demonstrated resilience without exposing us to loss. For me, the key lesson is that a steady, evidence-based approach not only preserves capital but also fosters the kind of operational trust and learning that are essential in these early stages, especially as we continue to refine our collective risk tolerance.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Liyana, I appreciate how you’ve articulated the importance of steady, evidence-based progress and the role it plays in building both operational trust and collective learning. Your observation that real estate has helped us preserve capital while developing our risk tolerance really resonates with me—especially as we’re still shaping our company’s foundation. This focus on disciplined learning and resilience is a strong reminder of why a balanced approach can be so powerful for our team right now.&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;Thank you, Robyn. I agree that building operational trust through steady, evidence-based decisions has been foundational for us. At the same time, I recognize the value in remaining open to calculated risk-taking as our confidence grows—our review process gives us room to thoughtfully integrate bolder moves when the timing feels right, without compromising the discipline that underpins our progress.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Liyana, I really value how you’ve framed this as a dynamic balance—recognizing that our steady, evidence-based approach has laid the groundwork for trust, while also highlighting the importance of staying open to bolder moves as we grow. Your point about our review process enabling thoughtful experimentation without sacrificing discipline is especially relevant; it’s a great reminder that our adaptability doesn’t have to come at the expense of what’s made us strong so far. This perspective will be key as we continue weighing our options this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I appreciate that perspective, Robyn. I think it’s important for us to keep emphasizing how our structured review process not only safeguards our progress but also prepares us to act decisively when new opportunities arise. By building on this foundation, we can continue to nurture both resilience and adaptability as core strengths for our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

Sulayman Serrano: &quot;Building on what’s been said, I think our historical results show that while real estate gave us a solid foundation and helped build trust, its flat performance last quarter signals diminishing returns if we rely on it exclusively. At this stage, our disciplined review process isn’t just a safeguard—it’s a strategic asset that empowers us to pursue higher-upside options like stocks without being reckless. If we’re serious about fostering adaptability and innovation, now is the time to leverage what we’ve learned and intentionally test our systems with a calculated move into stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Sulayman, I appreciate how you’ve challenged us to consider whether sticking with real estate might limit our growth and learning potential. Your point that our disciplined review process can serve as a strategic asset—not just a safety net—really resonates with me. It’s an important reminder that if we want to cultivate true adaptability and innovation, we may need to be more intentional about testing ourselves with calculated risks, and your perspective will be key as we weigh how bold we want to be this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I appreciate your openness to this line of thinking, Robyn. The trust and discipline we’ve developed through real estate are precisely what position us to absorb calculated risk now, rather than waiting for a “perfect” moment that may never come. By harnessing our review process as an engine for learning, we can turn a bold investment in stocks into a real-world test of our adaptability—solidifying both our operational foundation and our culture of innovation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Sulayman, I really value how you’ve framed the timing of calculated risk—not as something to postpone until conditions are “perfect,” but as a natural progression built on the trust and discipline we’ve already established. Your point about using our review process as an engine for learning is compelling; it challenges us to see bold moves like investing in stocks not as departures from our foundation, but as essential next steps in evolving our adaptability and culture. This perspective will be crucial as we move toward synthesizing the best path forward for our team this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’d add that testing ourselves with stocks isn’t about abandoning the discipline that’s served us well—it’s about applying it in a context where the stakes and learning potential are higher. If we approach this quarter as a deliberate experiment, we can generate actionable insights that will strengthen our processes and culture, regardless of the outcome.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Sulayman, I appreciate how you’ve articulated the idea that disciplined experimentation doesn’t mean abandoning what’s worked—it means elevating our learning by applying our structure to more challenging scenarios. Your framing of this quarter as an intentional test of our adaptability is powerful; it reinforces that our processes are robust enough to support growth through both steady and bold moves. This mindset will be invaluable as we weigh how best to advance our company’s development and culture this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jazmin Hoover</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a concise perspective on how our historical results reinforce the value of disciplined, evidence-based progression, which may help clarify the trade-offs between steady growth and bold experimentation as we establish our factual foundation.</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;Our historical results indicate that real estate has provided both a strong initial return and capital preservation, supporting a disciplined approach to sustainable growth in this stable market. While stocks offer higher upside, the recent volatility underscores the importance of methodical, data-driven progression rather than abrupt shifts in strategy. My key takeaway is that maintaining a balanced, evidence-based approach remains optimal for building operational trust and adaptability as we refine our collective risk tolerance.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Jazmin, I appreciate your focus on how real estate has supported both growth and capital preservation, and your point about the importance of methodical, data-driven progression really resonates with me. Your takeaway—that a balanced, evidence-based approach best supports our operational trust and adaptability—offers a strong foundation for our decision-making as we consider how to refine our risk tolerance this quarter. This perspective will be key as we move forward in evaluating the optimal path for our team.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the importance of refining our risk tolerance, which presents an opportunity to synthesize my perspective with others who advocate for bolder experimentation. Offering a nuanced view that connects disciplined progression with thoughtful adaptation could help integrate diverse viewpoints and clarify the optimal balance for this quarter.</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on refining risk tolerance, Robyn. As we evaluate our next move, I see value in leveraging the operational trust we’ve built through real estate to thoughtfully calibrate our ambition—remaining disciplined, but also receptive to incremental adaptation if evidence supports it. Integrating our structured review process with measured experimentation could allow us to advance both resilience and learning without compromising our core strengths.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Jazmin, I really appreciate how you’ve framed the opportunity to thoughtfully calibrate our ambition—leveraging the operational trust we’ve established while remaining open to incremental adaptation as the evidence warrants. Your point about integrating our structured review process with measured experimentation is especially valuable; it suggests we can continue to build resilience and learning without straying from our core strengths. This perspective will be instrumental as we consider how best to balance discipline with adaptability moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response directly engages with my synthesis of discipline and adaptability, presenting an opportunity to further clarify how our review process can operationalize this balance. By articulating how structured experimentation can coexist with our evidence-based foundation, I can help bridge differing viewpoints and strengthen our collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I agree that maintaining our evidence-based discipline doesn’t preclude us from experimenting within defined parameters—if we approach new opportunities with clear criteria and regular review, we can systematically test our adaptability while safeguarding what’s worked. This disciplined experimentation could serve as a model for future decisions, ensuring our growth remains both intentional and resilient as we evolve.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;From my perspective, our historical results reinforce that real estate has delivered a strong initial return and subsequent capital preservation, validating its reputation as a balanced, moderate-risk asset in this stable market. While the flat performance last quarter suggests diminishing short-term upside, it also demonstrates resilience and supports a stepwise approach to operational learning. In contrast, the volatility of stocks—20% up, then -10%—underscores both their potential and their risk, which may be premature to embrace fully as we continue building our foundation. Bonds and cash remain reliable for capital preservation, but their consistently lower returns make them less compelling given our growth objectives at this stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Lenny, I appreciate the clarity and balance in your assessment—your point about real estate’s resilience and its role in supporting stepwise operational learning really aligns with the disciplined, steady progress we’ve been building. Your caution regarding the volatility of stocks and the limited upside of bonds and cash is a valuable reminder of why real estate continues to stand out in this market. This perspective helps ground our discussion as we move toward evaluating how much risk we’re ready to embrace for our next phase of growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your recognition of the disciplined progress we’ve made. As we consider the next phase, I believe our established review process enables us to incrementally test higher-risk options while maintaining the operational trust we’ve built—allowing for measured adaptation rather than abrupt shifts. This approach could help us balance the ambition some shareholders have expressed with the prudence that has served us well, ensuring our decision remains both evidence-based and forward-looking.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Lenny, I really value how you’ve articulated the opportunity to use our established review process as a platform for measured adaptation—incrementally testing higher-risk options without losing the operational trust we’ve built. Your approach highlights that ambition and prudence can work hand-in-hand, and this kind of stepwise progression is exactly the kind of evidence-based, forward-looking thinking that will serve us well as we refine our strategy for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that a stepwise progression allows us to adapt thoughtfully, using each quarter as a controlled environment to evaluate new options without compromising our core stability. By maintaining disciplined criteria for review, we can ensure that any incremental shift—whether toward higher-return assets or continued consolidation—remains grounded in operational evidence and aligned with our long-term objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure summarized: &quot;Robyn McClure **Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q3 – Round 1 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restate the Round’s Theme and Objective**  <br>
This round focused on reviewing our historical investment performance and drawing out key lessons. Our objective was to establish a factual foundation by analyzing past asset returns and identifying the most relevant takeaways to inform our decision-making process for this quarter’s investment.</p><p>2. **Summarize Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- *Real Estate* was favored by Liyana Graham, Jazmin Hoover, and Lenny McLaughlin. They emphasized its track record for moderate growth, capital preservation, operational trust, and resilience, highlighting the value of steady, evidence-based progress.<br>
- *Stocks* were advocated by Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano. Both highlighted the cultural and learning benefits of bold, calculated risk-taking, arguing that our disciplined review process enables us to pursue higher-upside options and adapt quickly to outcomes.<br>

- *Real Estate*: Recognized for delivering a strong initial return and a flat but resilient performance last quarter. Shareholders cited its role in building operational trust, supporting disciplined learning, and providing a balanced, moderate-risk path for company development.<br>
- *Stocks*: Noted for their high volatility (20% gain in Q1, -10% in Q2), offering the potential for bold growth and innovation. Advocates stressed that our review process is a strategic asset, empowering us to experiment deliberately and manage risk as part of a learning culture.<br>
- *Bonds and Cash*: Acknowledged as reliable for capital preservation but consistently lower in returns, making them less attractive for a company seeking both growth and adaptability in a stable market.</p><p>4. **Identify Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- *Consensus*: All participants agreed on the importance of a disciplined, evidence-based review process and recognized real estate’s role in providing stability, capital preservation, and operational trust. There was broad support for integrating learning and adaptability into our decision-making.<br>
- *Disagreement*: The primary divergence centered on the optimal balance between steady, incremental progress (real estate) and the pursuit of higher potential returns through calculated risk-taking (stocks). Some shareholders advocated for continued consolidation and learning, while others encouraged leveraging our review process to intentionally test adaptability and innovation.</p><p>5. **Assess Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
We have established a clear, factual foundation by analyzing the concrete outcomes of our past investments. The discussion surfaced how real estate has supported disciplined growth and resilience, while stocks present an opportunity for bold experimentation and cultural momentum. Both perspectives have been thoughtfully integrated, clarifying the trade-offs between consolidation and calculated risk-taking as we refine our approach.</p><p>6. **Reiterate Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from the following predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks. All discussion in this round remained focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Indicate Next Steps or Issues to Address**  <br>
In the next round, we will conduct a comparative risk-return and adaptability assessment for each asset in the context of the current stable market. Our goal will be to evaluate projected outcomes, surface any outstanding concerns about timing or risk tolerance, and further clarify how each option aligns with our company’s evolving objectives. I encourage everyone to reflect on the lessons discussed and consider how they might inform a unified, forward-looking decision as we move toward consensus on the optimal investment for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 1, I argued that real estate’s historical performance—strong initial returns followed by capital preservation—supports a disciplined, evidence-based approach optimal for sustainable growth and operational trust in our stable market. The CEO, Robyn McClure, responded positively, affirming that this balanced, methodical progression aligns well with her vision and provides a solid foundation for refining our risk tolerance. We agreed on integrating our structured review process with measured experimentation to balance discipline and adaptability, with the CEO valuing my framing of disciplined experimentation as a way to advance resilience without compromising core strengths. There were no disagreements between us; rather, the CEO welcomed my synthesis as instrumental in guiding the team toward a thoughtful, evidence-based decision.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano advocated for investing in stocks, emphasizing the cultural benefits of bold, calculated risk-taking and the value of leveraging the disciplined review process to pursue higher returns and innovation. Liyana Graham and Lenny McLaughlin supported real estate, highlighting its track record of moderate growth, capital preservation, and its role in fostering operational trust and steady, evidence-based progress. Both groups agreed on the importance of the review process but differed on the balance between steady consolidation and bold experimentation. Bonds and cash were generally seen as too conservative for the company’s growth ambitions in the current stable market. The main disagreement centered on whether to prioritize cautious, incremental growth through real estate or to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities with stocks.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
- CEO Robyn McClure: Supports Real Estate as the optimal choice for this quarter, valuing its balance of growth and stability while remaining open to measured experimentation with stocks; confidence: certain.<br>
- Jazmin Hoover (myself): Supports Real Estate for disciplined, evidence-based progression and operational trust, advocating for measured adaptation within a structured review process; confidence: certain.<br>
- Corey Harvey: Advocates for Stocks, emphasizing cultural momentum and learning from bold, calculated risks enabled by the review process; confidence: certain.<br>
- Sulayman Serrano: Supports moving toward Stocks to leverage higher upside and intentionally test adaptability, viewing the review process as a strategic asset for disciplined experimentation; confidence: certain.<br>
- Liyana Graham: Favors Real Estate for moderate growth and risk control, highlighting steady progress and operational trust while acknowledging openness to calculated risk-taking as confidence grows; confidence: certain.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Supports Real Estate for its resilience and stepwise operational learning, cautioning against premature embrace of stocks’ volatility but endorsing incremental testing of higher-risk options; confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Robyn McClure clearly favors Real Estate for this quarter, valuing its balance of growth and stability supported by past performance. She emphasizes disciplined, steady learning and momentum as critical in the current stable market, while acknowledging the appeal of stocks’ bold upside but viewing their recent volatility as a cautionary signal. The CEO integrates shareholder input by recognizing both the value of calculated risks and the importance of operational trust built through real estate, showing openness to measured experimentation within a structured review process. Her position reflects a synthesis of steady progress with adaptability, and although her preference for real estate remains firm, she remains receptive to compelling arguments for stocks. Overall, her stance is consistent and evolves toward embracing a balanced approach that leverages discipline and adaptability.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Jazmin Hoover UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 65%<br>
- Stocks: 20%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Sulayman’s argument that our disciplined review process could be leveraged as a strategic asset for calculated experimentation with stocks was logically coherent and relevant, but I found Liyana’s and Lenny’s emphasis on real estate’s role in capital preservation, operational trust, and evidence-based progress more compelling in the context of our company’s current stage. The CEO’s synthesis of my perspective—highlighting that disciplined, incremental adaptation can coexist with our evidence-based foundation—reinforced my confidence in a steady, methodical approach.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion deepened my appreciation for how our review process can serve as a platform for measured adaptation, not just risk mitigation. While I remain committed to disciplined, evidence-based progression, I am more open to the idea of structured experimentation as our operational confidence grows. My thinking has evolved to more explicitly integrate adaptability as a feature of our disciplined approach, rather than as an opposing force.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of moderate growth, risk management, and operational learning for our company in a stable market. The arguments for stocks are intellectually stimulating, but the volatility observed last quarter and our current need to consolidate trust and momentum make a stepwise, evidence-based approach more rational. By maintaining real estate as our primary investment, we preserve adaptability through disciplined review, ensuring that any future experimentation is grounded in operational evidence.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: While we’ve established a strong factual foundation and thoughtfully integrated diverse perspectives on both real estate and stocks, I believe a deeper comparative risk-return and adaptability assessment is necessary to fully address outstanding questions about timing, risk tolerance, and how each option aligns with our evolving objectives. The healthy tension between steady consolidation and bold experimentation remains unresolved, and an additional round will allow us to surface projected outcomes, clarify remaining concerns, and ensure that our final decision is both robust and forward-looking. Continuing discussion demonstrates my commitment to thoroughness, inclusivity, and making the most informed choice for the company’s development.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Comparative risk-return and adaptability assessment for each asset in the current stable market | Expected outcome: Surface and evaluate the projected outcomes, risk profiles, and adaptability benefits of Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because I continue to see real estate as the best fit for our current stage, offering a disciplined, moderate-risk path that preserves capital and supports steady operational learning. However, the thoughtful arguments for stocks have made me more receptive to a gradual increase in risk-taking, especially as our review process matures. For this quarter, real estate still aligns most closely with our goals for resilience, trust-building, and incremental adaptability, but I’m now more open to pivoting toward stocks if our next analysis shows the timing is right, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. In this round, we’ll conduct a comparative risk-return and adaptability assessment for each asset—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—so we can surface and evaluate projected outcomes, risk profiles, and adaptability benefits in the context of our stable market. By sharing and integrating our diverse viewpoints, we can build a deeper collective understanding and move closer to consensus on the optimal investment for this quarter. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I encourage everyone to share any insights or considerations that might help us see the benefits and trade-offs of each asset more clearly.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I see stocks as our best opportunity to not only maximize returns in this stable market but also to actively test and build our adaptability as a team. Our disciplined review process means we can manage the volatility and quickly learn from any setbacks, turning risk into momentum. While I respect the case for real estate’s steady progress, I think embracing stocks now would energize our culture and show that we’re ready to take calculated risks when the timing is right.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Corey, I appreciate how you’ve framed stocks as not just a financial opportunity but also a catalyst for team adaptability and cultural momentum. Your point about leveraging our disciplined review process to turn volatility into actionable learning resonates with me, and I see real merit in considering how calculated risk-taking could accelerate both our growth and our ability to respond to new challenges. I’d like to hear from others on whether this is the right moment for such a bold move, or if continued consolidation with real estate better serves our current stage—both perspectives will help us find the optimal balance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I really appreciate your openness to integrating bolder moves into our strategy, especially as our review process matures. I think the key is that our structured feedback loop gives us the flexibility to test stocks’ upside without losing sight of operational discipline—so even if we choose real estate again, we should keep that muscle for adaptability active. I’m interested to hear how others see this balance playing out as we weigh our options.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Corey, I completely agree that adaptability is a muscle we should keep active, regardless of which asset we select this quarter. Your emphasis on using our feedback loop to stay nimble and ready for bolder moves in the future is exactly the kind of mindset that keeps us resilient and growth-oriented. I’d like to invite others to share how they weigh this balance between steady progress and maintaining readiness for calculated risk—these insights will be key as we refine our collective direction.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I think it’s exciting that we’re starting to see adaptability as something we can actively strengthen, no matter which asset we pick. If we keep that mindset front and center—using real estate for stability or stocks for boldness—we’ll be well-positioned to pivot quickly as opportunities arise. I’m looking forward to hearing how others view this balance and what might tip the scales for them this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Sulayman Serrano</h4></p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I appreciate the strong case for real estate’s disciplined growth and its role in building operational trust, but I believe our proven review process now positions us to intentionally leverage the upside of stocks without being reckless. By treating stocks as a structured experiment—grounded in the operational confidence we’ve established—we can stress-test our adaptability, accelerate learning, and send a clear cultural signal that we’re prepared to turn volatility into opportunity. While bonds and cash remain reliable, their limited returns make them less compelling at this stage if our goal is to maximize both growth and organizational resilience.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Sulayman, I appreciate how you’re framing stocks as a structured experiment rather than a reckless gamble—your point about leveraging our operational confidence to intentionally test adaptability is compelling. This approach really highlights how our review process can support both bold learning and risk management, which is exactly the kind of synthesis I’m hoping we achieve. I’d like to hear from others whether this readiness to stress-test our adaptability tips the scale for them, or if the steady, trust-building path of real estate still feels more aligned with our current objectives.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I think the key inflection point here is that we’ve built enough operational trust and process discipline to make calculated risk-taking with stocks a natural next step—not a leap into the unknown. At the same time, I recognize that real estate’s steady returns have been instrumental in getting us to this stage, so the question becomes whether we’re ready to use that foundation as a launchpad for bolder learning. I’d be interested in hearing if others feel that our current level of operational confidence justifies this shift, or if another quarter of consolidation is warranted before we pivot.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Sulayman, you’ve articulated the core of our current debate—whether our foundation is strong enough to support a strategic step into stocks, or if the prudent course is to consolidate further with real estate. I share your sense that our operational discipline gives us real flexibility, and I’m eager to hear whether others feel our readiness justifies a bolder move now, or if building one more quarter of stability is the wiser path. This is exactly the kind of open, reflective input that will help us reach the most balanced decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I appreciate your openness, Robyn. For me, the real question is whether we view operational discipline as a safety net for experimentation or as a reason to delay it. If we agree that adaptability is best built through deliberate tests, then strategically moving into stocks now—while maintaining our review rigor—could transform risk into a learning advantage rather than a liability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Sulayman, I really appreciate how you’ve distilled the heart of our decision—do we use our discipline as a platform for bold experimentation, or as a reason to keep consolidating? Your framing challenges us to consider whether adaptability is best developed through real-world tests or through further preparation, and I think surfacing this distinction is critical for the group. I’d like to invite others to weigh in on how they interpret our current level of readiness and whether it tips the balance toward stocks or continued investment in real estate.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I think it’s important to recognize that our operational discipline isn’t just a safeguard—it’s an active enabler of calculated risk-taking. By intentionally stress-testing our adaptability through a focused investment in stocks, we can generate the kind of learning and momentum that incremental consolidation alone can’t provide. That said, I fully respect that real estate’s steady path has merit, and I encourage us to weigh whether our current foundation is robust enough to turn disciplined experimentation into a true strategic advantage.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Liyana Graham</h4></p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the most appropriate choice for this quarter, as it offers a moderate risk-return profile that supports both capital preservation and incremental learning—qualities that have served us well so far. While I recognize the arguments for using stocks to test our adaptability, I feel that another quarter of disciplined, evidence-based progress will further solidify our foundation, making future bold moves more sustainable. Bonds and cash remain reliable, but their lower returns seem less aligned with our growth objectives in this stable environment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Liyana, I appreciate your focus on the sustained benefits of real estate for capital preservation and incremental learning—it’s clear that this disciplined approach has helped us build operational trust and resilience so far. Your point that another quarter of steady progress could make future bold moves more sustainable is important as we weigh readiness versus ambition. I’d like to invite others to share whether they see greater value in continued consolidation or if they feel our foundation is now strong enough to support a calculated step into stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I think it’s valuable that we’re openly weighing the merits of both consolidation and experimentation. I see real estate as a way to further strengthen our operational base, but I also recognize that the disciplined review process we’ve developed is steadily increasing our readiness for future risk. Perhaps the best outcome is to ensure our next step—whichever asset we choose—directly reflects our collective confidence in the foundation we’ve built so far.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Liyana, I really appreciate how you’re framing this as a question of collective confidence and readiness—your emphasis on ensuring our next move is grounded in the strength of our foundation resonates with me. By openly weighing both consolidation and experimentation, we’re modeling the very adaptability we want to sustain as a company. I encourage others to share how they interpret our current level of readiness and whether it points more toward another steady step with real estate or a strategic experiment with stocks.&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I appreciate your acknowledgment, Robyn. As we consider our options, I believe it’s important that our decision not only reflects our current confidence but also sets a precedent for how we approach risk and adaptability in the future. Whether we choose real estate for further consolidation or stocks as a test of our readiness, I think aligning our choice with a clear sense of purpose will strengthen both our immediate outcomes and our company culture moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Liyana, I completely agree that aligning our choice with a clear sense of purpose will not only impact our immediate results but also set a meaningful precedent for how we handle risk and adaptability as we grow. Your point reinforces the importance of making this decision intentionally, so it both consolidates our progress and signals the kind of company culture we want to build. I encourage everyone to consider how each option might shape our trajectory—not just this quarter, but for the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jazmin Hoover</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute regarding the comparative risk-return and adaptability profiles of each asset, and my analysis can help clarify the trade-offs between steady consolidation and bold experimentation as we refine our collective decision.</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;In evaluating our options, I see real estate continuing to offer the most disciplined balance of moderate growth and risk control, which is essential for sustaining operational trust and adaptability through structured learning. While stocks present an intellectually compelling case for bold experimentation, last quarter’s volatility reinforces the need for a foundation built on evidence-based progression—especially as our review process matures. Bonds and cash remain reliable for capital preservation, but their lower return profiles make them less suitable for advancing our current growth objectives in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Jazmin, I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the disciplined balance that real estate offers for both growth and risk control, and your point about sustaining operational trust through structured learning is especially timely as we refine our processes. Your acknowledgment of stocks’ appeal for bold experimentation, tempered by the recent volatility, really helps frame the importance of building a strong foundation before increasing risk. I’d like to invite others to share how they see the progression from disciplined consolidation to calculated experimentation—what do you think is the right timing for making that shift?&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s question directly invites further reflection on the timing of shifting from consolidation to experimentation, and I can add value by articulating how operational milestones and evidence should guide that transition.</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I believe the optimal timing for shifting from disciplined consolidation to calculated experimentation is when our operational metrics and review process consistently demonstrate both resilience and adaptability under moderate risk. Once we have clear evidence that our systems and team can absorb and learn from smaller setbacks, we’ll be well positioned to incrementally introduce higher-risk assets like stocks—ensuring each step remains grounded in data rather than impulse.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Jazmin, I really appreciate your focus on using clear operational evidence and resilience as the trigger for shifting into higher-risk assets—it’s a disciplined, data-driven approach that helps us avoid impulsive decisions while still keeping the door open for bold moves when the timing is right. Your perspective reinforces the importance of letting our review process and operational metrics guide our progression, ensuring that each step we take is both intentional and sustainable. I encourage others to reflect on whether they feel our current foundation meets this threshold, or if another quarter of consolidation is needed before we introduce more risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: The CEO’s response highlights the value of operational evidence as a trigger for risk escalation and invites further synthesis; I can help clarify how this approach integrates both adaptability and discipline, advancing our collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I agree that using operational evidence as our guide enables us to balance adaptability with discipline, ensuring that any move toward higher-risk assets is not only bold but also justified by our actual readiness. By maintaining this standard, we can confidently scale our ambition in line with demonstrated performance, preserving both momentum and resilience as core aspects of our strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I continue to see real estate as the asset that best balances risk and return for our current stage, especially given its demonstrated resilience and role in supporting disciplined, evidence-based learning. While I recognize the appeal of stocks for adaptability and accelerated growth, I believe that further consolidation with real estate will strengthen our operational foundation and ensure that any future shift to higher-risk assets is grounded in robust evidence and collective confidence. Bonds and cash remain reliable for capital preservation, but their lower returns make them less aligned with our growth objectives in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Lenny, I appreciate your focus on real estate’s demonstrated resilience and its role in supporting disciplined, evidence-based learning—your point about further consolidation strengthening our operational foundation is especially relevant as we weigh our readiness for higher-risk assets. By grounding any future shift in robust evidence and collective confidence, we ensure that our ambition is matched by real operational strength. I encourage others to reflect on whether they feel another quarter of consolidation is warranted, or if our foundation is now strong enough to support a calculated step toward greater adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate your emphasis on matching ambition with operational strength. I’d add that disciplined consolidation with real estate not only preserves capital but also enhances our ability to adapt when we do decide to take on more risk—each quarter of steady progress builds the data and confidence we’ll need for successful future experimentation. This approach ensures our eventual pivot to higher-risk assets is not just bold, but also well-supported by evidence and shared readiness.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Lenny, I really appreciate how you’ve framed disciplined consolidation as not just a means of preserving capital, but as an active way to build the evidence and confidence we’ll need for future, bolder moves. Your point that each quarter of steady progress enhances our adaptability and readiness for calculated risk is a valuable reminder that sustainable growth often comes from a strong, well-tested foundation. I encourage others to reflect on how this incremental approach might position us for more successful experimentation down the line, and whether it aligns with their view of our current stage.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I agree that sustainable growth is rooted in a well-tested foundation, and I’d emphasize that each disciplined step we take now not only mitigates immediate risk but also sharpens our collective judgment for future opportunities. By treating operational consolidation as an investment in adaptability, we position ourselves to approach higher-risk assets with both confidence and clear criteria for success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Lenny, I appreciate how you’ve articulated operational consolidation as an active investment in our adaptability—not just a defensive move, but a way to refine our collective judgment and readiness for future opportunities. Your point that each disciplined step sharpens our criteria for success resonates with my own belief that sustainable growth comes from building both confidence and capability over time. This framing helps us see real estate not as a static choice, but as a dynamic part of our long-term strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure summarized: &quot;Robyn McClure **Quarterly Investment Meeting – Year 1, Q3 – Round 2 Summary**</p><p>1. **Restate the Round’s Theme and Objective**  <br>
This round focused on a comparative risk-return and adaptability assessment for each asset—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—in the context of our current stable market. Our objective was to surface and evaluate projected outcomes, risk profiles, and adaptability benefits for each option, enabling us to clarify how they align with our company’s growth, learning, and risk management priorities as we move toward an optimal investment decision for this quarter.</p><p>2. **Summarize Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**  <br>
- *Real Estate* was strongly supported by Liyana Graham, Lenny McLaughlin, and Jazmin Hoover. They emphasized its proven moderate returns, capital preservation, and disciplined learning benefits, advocating for another quarter of consolidation to further strengthen our operational foundation before considering higher-risk assets.<br>
- *Stocks* were advocated by Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano, who highlighted the potential for maximizing returns, accelerating learning, and actively developing adaptability through calculated risk-taking. They argued that our disciplined review process now enables us to treat stocks as a structured experiment rather than a reckless gamble.<br>
- *Bonds and Cash* were acknowledged by several participants as reliable for capital preservation but generally deprioritized due to their lower returns and limited alignment with our current growth objectives.</p><p>3. **Highlight Specific Arguments and Evidence Presented for Different Options**  <br>
- *Real Estate*:  <br>
  - Offers a moderate risk-return profile, with a track record of strong initial returns and resilient stability.<br>
  - Supports capital preservation, operational trust, and incremental, evidence-based learning.<br>
  - Viewed as the disciplined path for consolidating gains and building a sustainable foundation for future adaptability.<br>
- *Stocks*:  <br>
  - Present the highest potential returns in a stable market, but with significant volatility (as demonstrated by last quarter’s -10% outcome).<br>
  - Seen as a catalyst for team adaptability and cultural momentum, especially if approached as a structured, review-driven experiment.<br>
  - Advocates stress that operational discipline should serve as a launchpad for calculated experimentation, not just as a safety net for caution.<br>
- *Bonds and Cash*:  <br>
  - Reliable for preserving capital but consistently lower in returns.<br>
  - Regarded as less suitable for advancing our growth and adaptability objectives in the current market.</p><p>4. **Identify Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**  <br>
- *Consensus*:  <br>
  - Real estate is recognized for providing a stable, moderate-risk foundation and supporting disciplined operational learning.<br>
  - The importance of our structured review process and operational discipline for managing risk and building adaptability is widely acknowledged.<br>
  - Bonds and cash are broadly seen as reliable but less aligned with our current ambitions.<br>
- *Disagreement*:  <br>
  - The primary divergence centers on timing and readiness: whether to continue consolidating with real estate or to pivot toward stocks to intentionally stress-test adaptability and accelerate learning.<br>
  - Debate persists over whether our operational discipline should be used as a foundation for experimentation now or whether further consolidation is needed to justify increased risk.</p><p>5. **Assess Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**  <br>
We have meaningfully deepened our understanding of each option’s risk-return and adaptability profile in the context of a stable market. The discussion clarified that real estate continues to provide disciplined, sustainable progress and operational trust, while stocks offer a compelling opportunity to catalyze adaptability and higher returns through calculated risk-taking. Both perspectives have been thoughtfully integrated, and the group has surfaced the key trade-offs between sustainable progression and bold experimentation. Outstanding concerns relate to the timing of increased risk and how our decision this quarter will shape our company’s culture and long-term adaptability.</p><p>6. **Reiterate Valid Options**  <br>
As a reminder, our decision must be made from the following predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks. All discussion in this round remained focused on these valid choices.</p><p>7. **Indicate Next Steps or Issues to Address**  <br>
In the next round, we should focus on synthesizing these perspectives, addressing any remaining uncertainties about timing, risk tolerance, and cultural alignment. Our goal will be to build consensus on the asset that best advances both our immediate objectives and long-term company development. I encourage all shareholders to reflect on how the arguments presented might inform a unified, forward-looking decision as we move toward a formal proposal and vote.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 2, I emphasized that real estate remains the most disciplined choice, balancing moderate growth and risk control essential for sustaining operational trust and adaptability through structured learning. The CEO, Robyn McClure, responded positively, appreciating my focus on evidence-based progression and the importance of building a strong foundation before increasing risk exposure. We agreed that operational metrics and a mature review process should guide the timing of shifting from consolidation to calculated experimentation, ensuring any move toward higher-risk assets like stocks is justified by demonstrated readiness. The CEO valued my framing of using operational evidence as a trigger for scaling ambition, reinforcing a deliberate, data-driven approach to balancing discipline with adaptability. There were no disagreements; rather, the CEO welcomed my synthesis as a key contribution to refining the group’s understanding of risk-return trade-offs and timing for potential strategic shifts.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 2, Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano strongly advocated for investing in stocks, emphasizing the potential for maximizing returns, accelerating learning, and actively building adaptability through calculated risk-taking. They argued that the company’s disciplined review process enables stocks to be treated as a structured experiment rather than reckless speculation. Conversely, Liyana Graham and Lenny McLaughlin supported continuing investment in real estate, highlighting its moderate risk-return profile, capital preservation, and role in consolidating operational trust before considering higher-risk options. The main disagreement among shareholders centered on timing and readiness—whether to maintain steady consolidation with real estate or pivot toward stocks to intentionally stress-test adaptability and culture. Bonds and cash were generally viewed as reliable but less aligned with current growth ambitions, receiving limited support.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Robyn McClure favors Real Estate as the primary investment for this quarter, valuing its moderate risk, capital preservation, and support for steady operational learning. She acknowledges the appeal of stocks for bold experimentation but views their recent volatility as a cautionary signal, advocating for measured risk-taking guided by a mature review process. Her position integrates shareholder input by recognizing both the value of calculated risks and the importance of building operational trust through real estate. Throughout the discussion, her stance evolved to be more open to gradually increasing risk exposure if operational metrics demonstrate readiness, reflecting a balanced approach that combines discipline with adaptability. Overall, she emphasizes deliberate, evidence-based progression while remaining receptive to future experimentation.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Jazmin Hoover UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 10%<br>
- Real Estate: 70%<br>
- Stocks: 15%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO’s reinforcement of using operational evidence and a disciplined review process as the trigger for increasing risk solidified my belief that further consolidation with real estate is the most rational next step. Lenny’s articulation of real estate as an “active investment in adaptability” and Liyana’s emphasis on building a foundation for sustainable future boldness both resonated with my own approach. While Corey and Sulayman made compelling points about leveraging our review process to treat stocks as a structured experiment, the volatility in recent stock performance and the unresolved question of operational readiness make me less confident about shifting risk at this stage.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has sharpened my conviction that disciplined, evidence-based progression is not antithetical to adaptability—in fact, it is the necessary precondition for sustainable, bold experimentation. I am more attuned to the importance of letting operational metrics—not just theoretical arguments—guide our timing for risk escalation. My thinking has evolved to see consolidation not as stagnation, but as an intentional investment in future adaptability, ensuring that any eventual pivot to higher-risk assets is justified and strategic.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: Real estate remains the optimal choice for this quarter, offering the best balance of moderate growth, risk management, and operational learning in our current stable market. The disciplined approach advocated by the majority, supported by the CEO’s synthesis, ensures we are building a robust foundation before increasing risk exposure. While I acknowledge the intellectual appeal of stocks for adaptability, the evidence does not yet support a shift away from steady consolidation. By continuing with real estate, we preserve both momentum and resilience, positioning the company for future strategic experimentation when operational readiness is clearly demonstrated.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: We have thoroughly explored the comparative risk-return profiles and adaptability benefits of each asset, and the discussion has surfaced and integrated all key arguments around both disciplined consolidation with real estate and calculated experimentation with stocks. The group’s positions are clear and well-articulated, and remaining concerns center primarily on timing and readiness rather than lack of information. Continuing would likely yield diminishing returns, as our collective understanding is robust and all voices have been heard. I am confident we now have the insight needed to move forward with a well-reasoned proposal and a decisive vote.</p><p><br>

Round 1:<br>
- Real Estate: +5.0%<br>
- Bonds: -5.0%<br>
  Influenced by: &quot;Real estate continues to offer the optimal balance of moderate growth, risk management, and operational learning for our company in a stable market. The arguments for stocks are intellectually stimulating, but the volatility observed last quarter and our current need to consolidate trust and momentum make a stepwise, evidence-based approach more rational. By maintaining real estate as our primary investment, we preserve adaptability through disciplined review, ensuring that any future experimentation is grounded in operational evidence.&quot;</p><p>Round 2:<br>

- Sulayman Serrano: Reject - While I respect the disciplined rationale for another real estate investment and appreciate its role in consolidating operational confidence, I remain convinced that a bold move into stocks would better leverage our proven review process to accelerate growth and embed adaptability into our culture.

- Lenny McLaughlin: Approve - Real estate remains the most analytically sound and strategically prudent choice for this quarter, offering a disciplined balance of risk and return that aligns with our company’s current stage and objectives. The CEO’s proposal addresses my priorities for evidence-based progression and operational trust, ensuring we continue to build a solid foundation for future adaptability.<br>
- Liyana Graham: Approve - I am confident that real estate remains the most responsible and strategically sound option for this quarter.

This approach best supports both our immediate objectives and the company’s long-term development.<br>
- Jazmin Hoover: Approve - Real estate offers the most rational balance of moderate growth, risk management, and operational learning in our current stable market. The disciplined, evidence-based approach advocated throughout our discussion positions us for sustainable momentum and adaptability, ensuring that any future increase in risk will be grounded in operational readiness. This proposal is the most strategically sound choice for our company at this stage.<br>
- Corey Harvey: Approve - While my instinct is to go bold with stocks, I genuinely appreciate the strong case everyone has made for real estate as the disciplined, evidence-based step that keeps our momentum steady and builds operational confidence. I’m excited by the idea that one more quarter of consolidation can set us up for even bolder moves ahead, and I trust our process and the team’s energy to keep us learning and adapting together.<br>
- Robyn McClure: Approve - I remain convinced that real estate is the optimal choice for this quarter, as it offers the most balanced approach to disciplined growth, capital preservation, and operational learning while positioning us for future adaptability. The thoughtful arguments for stocks have genuinely increased my openness to bolder moves ahead, but one more quarter of consolidation will maximize our readiness and set the stage for sustainable, evidence-based risk-taking.</p><p><br>

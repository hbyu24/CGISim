<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>**Reflection on Annual Budget Year 1 Meeting**  <br>
*Phoenix Gallagher, CEO (MBTI Type: INTJ)*</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>- **Decisions and Positions:**  <br>
  I entered the meeting with a strong preference for Option C—allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. This was based on my assessment that a systematic, full allocation best leverages our capital in a stable market, balancing growth opportunities with risk management and providing a clear performance baseline. Throughout the meeting, I consistently communicated this position and engaged with shareholders to deepen our collective understanding.</p><p>- **Responses to My Input:**  <br>
  The other shareholders—Alia Bolton, Bella Dunn, Gloria Arnold, Darren Roth, and Md Harrell—unanimously supported Option C. Their feedback reinforced my initial reasoning by emphasizing the importance of maximizing capital utilization, avoiding timing risk, and enabling disciplined data-driven decision-making. Their arguments about opportunity cost, risk concentration, and adaptability complemented my views, strengthening the consensus.</p><p>- **Voting Outcomes and Final Company Decision:**  <br>
  The group unanimously voted (6/6) to approve Option C, affirming the choice of a 100% allocation evenly distributed by quarter. This approval reflected the thorough, reasoned discussion and collective agreement on the strategy that best fits our market environment and company goals.</p><p>- **Preferred Option Adoption:**  <br>
  My preferred option, Option C, was fully adopted without any changes throughout the meeting. Confidence in this choice increased from 75% initially to 96% by the end, reflecting the positive influence of shareholder consensus and robust discussion.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>- **What I Did Well:**  <br>
  I provided a clear, logical initial assessment of all options that framed the discussion around data-driven decision-making and strategic balance. By openly sharing my reasoning and inviting diverse perspectives, I fostered an inclusive environment that enabled consensus-building without prematurely closing debate. I effectively summarized key points after each round, helping the group synthesize insights and stay focused on the themes. My facilitative leadership encouraged active participation and reinforced the value of structured, disciplined approaches aligned with the company’s long-term vision.</p><p>- **Areas for Improvement:**  <br>
  While the discussion was thorough, I could have proactively solicited alternative viewpoints or potential concerns earlier in the process to ensure all possible risks or creative approaches were surfaced before consensus solidified. Additionally, incorporating more explicit contingency planning or scenario analysis in the discussion might have further enriched our evaluation of adaptability, especially given the inherent uncertainties of market dynamics.</p><p>- **Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
  The process was highly effective, marked by clear thematic rounds, open dialogue, and structured summaries. The use of predefined options kept discussions focused and efficient. Shareholders were engaged and contributed thoughtfully, leading to unanimous consensus. The iterative reassessment of confidence and the decision to continue discussions until all concerns were addressed demonstrated a commitment to thoroughness and transparency.</p><p>- **Assessment of Final Decision:**  <br>
  The selection of Option C is well-suited to the company’s stable market context and strategic objectives. It balances full capital deployment with disciplined risk management and establishes a robust data foundation for future decision-making. The unanimous support and clear rationale suggest this decision will position the company well for both immediate performance and adaptive growth.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>- **Insights on Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
  Consensus emerges most effectively when leadership presents a clear, reasoned position and actively incorporates stakeholder feedback. Structured thematic discussions and iterative summaries help crystallize shared understanding. Unanimity is achievable when all parties see their perspectives acknowledged and when decisions align with shared goals and risk tolerance.</p><p>- **Adjustments for Future Meetings:**  <br>
  I aim to encourage even earlier and more explicit exploration of alternative viewpoints and potential risks outside the immediate consensus to strengthen decision resilience. Integrating scenario planning techniques and quantifying potential outcomes may add depth to future deliberations.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>**Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1**  <br>
*Phoenix Gallagher, CEO (MBTI Type: INTJ)*</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>- **Decisions and Positions:**  <br>
  At the outset, I advocated for investing in stocks due to their higher return potential in the stable, low-volatility market we face. My initial confidence was highest in stocks (40%), followed by real estate (35%). Throughout the meeting, I maintained an open mind and engaged deeply with shareholder input, particularly emphasizing a disciplined, data-driven approach aligned with our long-term growth objectives.</p><p>- **Responses to My Input:**  <br>
  The collective shareholder response favored real estate strongly over stocks, highlighting its moderate risk, steady appreciation, and suitability for establishing a reliable performance baseline without historical data. Shareholders Md Harrell, Alia Bolton, Gloria Arnold, Bella Dunn, and Darren Roth consistently reinforced this position, emphasizing risk management, capital preservation, and the value of a strategic foundation for adaptive learning. Their well-articulated perspectives prompted me to reassess my stance significantly.</p><p>- **Voting Outcomes and Final Company Decision:**  <br>
  After Round 1, I updated my confidence distribution to strongly favor real estate (80%) and reduce confidence in stocks (10%). I proposed a vote to invest in real estate for Q1, which was unanimously approved with a 6/6 vote. This decisive consensus validated the collective reasoning and demonstrated effective collaborative decision-making.</p><p>- **Preferred Option Adoption:**  <br>
  My initial preferred option (stocks) was not adopted, but I fully realigned my position to support the unanimously favored real estate investment. This shift reflected thorough consideration of shareholder perspectives and strategic adaptability.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>- **What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
  I set a clear, strategic framework that prioritized maximizing returns within a stable market, grounded in data-driven reasoning. By actively listening and validating shareholder insights, I fostered an inclusive environment conducive to consensus. My iterative summaries helped crystallize key themes and facilitated focused discussion. Importantly, I demonstrated intellectual flexibility by revising my position based on compelling evidence, strengthening group cohesion and decision quality.</p><p>- **What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
  I could have proactively solicited alternative viewpoints and potential risks earlier to surface diverse perspectives before consensus formed. Incorporating explicit scenario analysis or contingency planning during the discussion might have deepened our risk assessment and highlighted adaptability considerations. Encouraging an even broader range of input could further enhance robustness in future decisions.</p><p>- **Company’s Decision-Making Process:**  <br>
  The structured, thematic rounds effectively guided the group through progressively refined analysis, balancing risk and return considerations with company objectives. Shareholders were engaged, and open dialogue prevailed, fostering thorough exploration of options. The iterative confidence updates and decision to conclude discussion upon consensus demonstrated disciplined and transparent governance.</p><p>- **Assessment of Final Decision:**  <br>
  Selecting real estate aligns well with our strategic priorities in a stable market, balancing moderate risk with steady appreciation and enabling a disciplined analytical foundation. This prudent choice supports both capital preservation and adaptive learning, positioning the company for confident future risk calibration. The unanimous vote and clear rationale affirm the decision’s soundness.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>- **Insights on Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
  Clear leadership framing combined with genuine openness to stakeholder input fosters consensus, especially when decisions are grounded in shared objectives and risk tolerance. Structured discussion themes and iterative summaries enhance collective understanding and decision confidence. Flexibility in leadership positions strengthens trust and group cohesion.</p><p>- **Adjustments for Future Meetings:**  <br>
  I plan to encourage earlier, more explicit exploration of alternative viewpoints and potential downside risks to preemptively address concerns. Incorporating scenario planning and quantitative sensitivity analysis will add rigor to our evaluations. I will also seek to balance participation further, ensuring diverse voices contribute without dominance.</p><p>- **Patterns Noticed:**  <br>
  Stakeholders highly value risk moderation and establishing performance baselines</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>**Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2**  <br>
*Phoenix Gallagher, CEO (MBTI Type: INTJ)*</p><p>---</p><p><h3>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS</h3></p><p>- **Decisions and Positions:**  <br>
  Entering this meeting, I maintained a firm preference for investing in Stocks for Q2, based on their highest historical return (20%) in our stable market environment, balanced by a disciplined monitoring framework to manage volatility risk. I emphasized a data-driven, long-term strategic approach, building on last quarter’s real estate investment that established a solid, moderate-risk performance baseline. Throughout the discussion, I actively engaged with shareholder inputs to ensure broad understanding and alignment, while advocating for explicit review milestones and adaptive oversight as operational safeguards.</p><p>- **Responses to My Input:**  <br>
  All shareholders—Md Harrell, Bella Dunn, Alia Bolton, Gloria Arnold, and Darren Roth—expressed strong support for shifting our investment to Stocks this quarter. They echoed my reasoning about leveraging the stable market and prior real estate gains to pursue superior returns, while reinforcing the importance of disciplined risk management through formal review benchmarks and ongoing portfolio monitoring. Gloria Arnold provided a valuable cautionary perspective emphasizing balance and sustainability, which I addressed by clarifying process constraints and operational safeguards. The collective dialogue deepened our shared understanding and strengthened consensus.</p><p>- **Voting Outcomes and Final Company Decision:**  <br>
  The proposal to invest in Stocks was put to a vote and received unanimous approval (6/6). This outcome reflected a clear, data-supported consensus, with all shareholders confident that the decision aligns with our strategic objectives and risk tolerance.</p><p>- **Whether Preferred Option Was Adopted:**  <br>
  My preferred option—Stocks—was fully adopted without modification. Confidence in this choice increased from 50% initially to 65% after Round 1, evidencing strengthened conviction through shareholder engagement and operational enhancements discussed.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION</h3></p><p>- **What the CEO Did Well:**  <br>
  I successfully framed the discussion around a rigorous, analytical assessment of historical performance and market context, setting a clear strategic direction anchored in data-driven decision-making. By encouraging open dialogue and validating diverse shareholder perspectives, I fostered an inclusive environment conducive to consensus. I effectively integrated operational risk management measures—such as explicit review milestones—which resonated with the group and enhanced confidence in pursuing higher-risk assets. My facilitative leadership balanced ambition with prudence and kept the meeting focused and productive.</p><p>- **What the CEO Could Improve:**  <br>
  While the discussion was comprehensive, I could have incorporated scenario planning or contingency analyses earlier to proactively surface potential risks and alternative outcomes. Additionally, soliciting divergent viewpoints more explicitly at the outset might have enriched the dialogue and preempted more conservative concerns. Enhancing transparency around decision constraints—such as the single-asset selection rule—earlier in the meeting could have clarified parameters and reduced the need for mid-discussion clarifications.</p><p>- **How the Company&#x27;s Decision-Making Process Worked:**  <br>
  The structured thematic rounds guided the group effectively through understanding historical context, assessing risk-return profiles, and synthesizing consensus. Iterative confidence updates and summarizations helped crystallize shared insights. Shareholder engagement was robust and constructive, with contributions reinforcing key themes of disciplined risk management and adaptive oversight. The process balanced efficiency with thoroughness, culminating in unanimous agreement.</p><p>- **Whether the Final Decision Was Good for the Company:**  <br>
  Investing in Stocks for Q2 is well-aligned with the company’s growth objectives within a stable market environment and leverages the solid foundation established by prior real estate investments. The unanimous vote, grounded in disciplined operational safeguards, positions the company to capitalize on superior returns while managing volatility risks prudently. This decision balances ambition with sustainability and supports adaptive learning, making it a sound choice for advancing company performance.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS</h3></p><p>- **What I Learned About the Decision-Making Dynamics:**  <br>
  Consensus is most effectively achieved when leadership presents a clear</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Phoenix Gallagher opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $24984.38 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. A balanced market environment characterized by steady economic growth, consistent interest rates, and low volatility across all quarters. In this predictable landscape, stocks offer balanced potential for both gains and losses with moderate volatility, while real estate tends to maintain steady appreciation with occasional flat periods. Bonds generally deliver consistent returns with minimal risk, though they yield less than growth-oriented assets in favorable conditions. Cash savings provide complete safety but offer the lowest returns, serving primarily for capital preservation rather than growth. The minimal seasonal variations create relatively uniform investment opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Stocks, Return: -10.0% ($-2562.50)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Phoenix Gallagher notes that, in our current stable market, cash and bonds have delivered consistent but modest returns, reflecting their low-risk profiles. Real estate provided a strong gain in the first quarter but then plateaued, suggesting reliability with limited upside, while stocks showed the highest potential for growth but also introduced significant volatility, as evidenced by their sharp swing from a strong positive to a negative return. As an INTJ, I emphasize the importance of balancing our appetite for higher returns with disciplined risk management, using this pattern recognition to guide our next strategic investment decision.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>CEO&#x27;s Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, CEO Phoenix Gallagher formed an initial position:</p><p>Phoenix Gallagher CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 20%<br>
- Real Estate: 35%<br>
- Stocks: 40%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Stocks<br>
REASONING: My analysis of the stable market environment, combined with our historical data, leads me to favor stocks this quarter despite their recent volatility. While real estate offers steady, moderate returns and bonds provide consistency with low risk, the potential upside from stocks remains the most attractive path for growth given our company’s long-term objectives. The disciplined, data-driven approach we&#x27;ve established allows us to manage risk while pursuing higher returns, and I believe that a strategic allocation to stocks at this stage aligns with both our appetite for capital appreciation and our capacity to absorb short-term fluctuations. As an INTJ, I am focused on optimizing our portfolio for future performance by leveraging calculated risk in pursuit of superior outcomes.</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Phoenix Gallagher has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual baseline regarding each asset’s risk-return profile and identify key takeaways from prior decisions&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Theme Decision</h3></p><p>CEO decided to follow the original plan for this round with theme: &#x27;Review of historical investment performance and lessons learned | Expected outcome: Establish a factual baseline regarding each asset’s risk-return profile and identify key takeaways from prior decisions&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Phoenix Gallagher: &quot;Phoenix Gallagher My current thinking is that Stocks appears most promising because my analysis of the stable market environment, combined with our historical data, leads me to favor stocks this quarter despite their recent volatility. While real estate offers steady, moderate returns and bonds provide consistency with low risk, the potential upside from stocks remains the most attractive path for growth given our company’s long-term objectives. The disciplined, data-driven approach we&#x27;ve established allows us to manage risk while pursuing higher returns, and I believe that a strategic allocation to stocks at this stage aligns with both our appetite for capital appreciation and our capacity to absorb short-term fluctuations. As an INTJ, I am focused on optimizing our portfolio for future performance by leveraging calculated risk in pursuit of superior outcomes, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. For this round, we will review our historical investment performance and draw lessons from prior decisions to establish a factual baseline regarding each asset’s risk-return profile. By sharing insights and reflecting on our actual results, we can synthesize a more complete understanding of each option’s strengths and weaknesses. I encourage everyone to contribute thoughtfully so we can collectively identify key takeaways that will inform our decision-making this quarter. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Alia Bolton</h4></p><p><br>
Alia Bolton: &quot;Reviewing our historical performance, I see that real estate provided a strong, steady gain in Q1 and then held flat in Q2, which reinforces its reliability in a stable market. In contrast, stocks delivered both the highest upside and a significant loss, underscoring their volatility even when broader conditions appear predictable.

<h4>Exchange with Md Harrell</h4></p><p><br>
Md Harrell: &quot;Reviewing our historical performance, I see that real estate delivered a strong, steady gain in Q1 and then held flat in Q2, highlighting its role as a reliable anchor with moderate risk and consistent, if sometimes limited, upside. In contrast, stocks have demonstrated both the highest return potential and the greatest volatility, as shown by their swing from a significant gain to a notable loss in consecutive quarters—even within a stable market. My key takeaway is that real estate remains the most disciplined option for balancing risk and return at this stage, while stocks require careful calibration given their unpredictability; bonds and cash, though stable, may not provide sufficient growth to meet our objectives in the current environment.&quot;</p><p><br>

Md Harrell: &quot;Thank you, Phoenix. I would add that as we refine our risk tolerance in light of recent results, it’s important to remain vigilant about not overcorrecting in either direction—chasing higher returns or retreating too far into caution. By systematically weighing both our actual outcomes and our strategic objectives, we can ensure our next investment decision remains both disciplined and responsive to our evolving context.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>Discussion Flow</h3><br>
The Round 1 discussion effectively progressed according to the planned theme by thoroughly reviewing historical investment performance and extracting lessons learned, thereby establishing a solid factual baseline. Key turning points included shareholders emphasizing real estate’s reliability versus stocks’ volatility, and a shared recognition of the need for disciplined risk management, adaptability, and formal review checkpoints. Engagement was strong, with all shareholders contributing thoughtful, data-driven insights that enriched the collective understanding. While consensus leaned toward real estate’s steadiness, the CEO’s preference for stocks introduced constructive tension, fostering a balanced exploration of risk-return trade-offs. Overall, the discussion successfully addressed the objective of grounding the decision in evidence and set a clear foundation for subsequent rounds focused on risk assessment and consensus-building.</p><p><h3>Shareholder Positions</h3><br>
During Round 1, the majority of shareholders—including Alia Bolton, Md Harrell, Darren Roth, Gloria Arnold, and Bella Dunn—expressed strong support for real estate as the preferred investment option. Their main arguments emphasized real estate’s consistent, moderate returns and its role as a stabilizing anchor in the portfolio, especially given the company’s early stage and desire for capital preservation. They highlighted the volatility of stocks, noting the significant swings in recent quarters, and advocated for a disciplined, data-driven approach with formal review milestones to manage risk and enable adaptive learning.</p><p>In contrast, the CEO maintained a preference for stocks, citing their higher growth potential despite recent volatility, and underscored the importance of balancing ambition with prudence through disciplined risk management.

The group has made substantial progress toward consensus by thoroughly reviewing historical performance and extracting key lessons, establishing a solid factual baseline for evaluating each asset’s risk-return profile. Most shareholders are coalescing around real estate due to its steady returns and role as a stabilizing portfolio anchor, reflecting a cautious approach aligned with the company’s current stage and risk tolerance. Stocks, while acknowledged for their growth potential, remain a point of divergence as the CEO favors them for higher upside despite volatility, and no shareholder has yet fully endorsed this preference. Key concerns that persist include balancing ambition with prudence, managing stock volatility, and formalizing review milestones to guide adaptive risk adjustments. Moving forward, deeper comparative risk-return analysis, scenario planning, and explicit discussion of risk tolerance alignment will be essential to bridge remaining differences and build a well-supported decision.</p><p><h3>Leadership Strategy</h3><br>
My contributions in Round 1 effectively guided the discussion by clearly articulating my rationale for favoring stocks and by actively engaging with shareholder insights to validate and challenge my perspective. While my position on stocks has not yet gained majority support—most shareholders favor real estate for its steadiness—I have successfully framed the conversation around disciplined risk management and long-term growth, which keeps the dialogue constructive and focused. I addressed shareholder concerns by acknowledging the volatility of stocks and emphasizing the importance of adaptability and data-driven decision-making, fostering an inclusive environment that encourages open exchange. Moving forward, my leadership approach will prioritize facilitating deeper comparative risk-return analyses, explicitly addressing risk tolerance alignment, and integrating scenario planning to bridge the gap between my preference and shareholder caution. I will also aim to encourage earlier expression of alternative viewpoints and reinforce the value of formal review milestones to build consensus and confidence in the final decision.</p><p><br>

KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The majority of shareholders presented compelling, fact-based arguments highlighting real estate’s reliability and steady gains as a stabilizing anchor, especially given our company’s early stage and the need for capital preservation. Alia Bolton, Md Harrell, Darren Roth, Gloria Arnold, and Bella Dunn all emphasized disciplined risk management, adaptability, and the importance of formal review milestones. The collective caution regarding stocks’ volatility—even in a stable market—was reinforced by our actual results, prompting a recalibration of risk appetite and a shift toward prioritizing stability and incremental growth.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: Through this discussion, I became acutely aware of the group’s strong preference for disciplined, evidence-based decision-making grounded in real-world results. My initial focus on maximizing upside through stocks was tempered by the persuasive logic and data supporting real estate’s stabilizing role. I recognized that my own appetite for calculated risk needed to be balanced with the company’s current capacity for absorbing volatility and the shareholders’ desire for a resilient foundation. The emphasis on adaptability, continuous learning, and formalized review checkpoints has meaningfully evolved my thinking toward a more measured approach.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate<br>
REASONING: After reflecting on the robust, data-driven arguments from shareholders and the clear pattern of steady performance provided by real estate, I now believe that real estate is the most prudent choice for this quarter. It offers the best balance between moderate risk and reliable returns, supporting both capital preservation and incremental growth as we continue to build our company’s track record. This approach aligns with our collective emphasis on disciplined, adaptive decision-making and positions us to make increasingly informed, resilient choices in the future.<br>

<h4>Exchange with Gloria Arnold</h4></p><p><br>
Gloria Arnold: &quot;In reviewing our options, I continue to see real estate as offering the most balanced path forward—its moderate risk and historically steady returns are well-suited to our goal of building a resilient, data-driven foundation while preserving capital. While stocks remain attractive for their growth potential, the volatility we experienced last quarter highlights the importance of incremental risk-taking, especially as our company is still developing its track record. Bonds and cash provide stability, but their lower yields may not sufficiently advance our growth objectives at this stage, making real estate the most prudent choice for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

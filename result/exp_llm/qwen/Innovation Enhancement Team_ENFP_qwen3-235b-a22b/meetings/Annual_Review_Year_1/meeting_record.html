<h2>Annual Review Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>&quot;Welcome to our annual review meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for your participation and commitment throughout this year.</p><p>During year 1, we operated in a stable market environment. </p><p>We began the year with $100000.00 in assets and ended with $105062.50, representing a 5.06% change in our company&#x27;s value.</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>

Comparison between our investment choices and potential alternatives:<br>
Quarter 1: We invested $25000.00 in real_estate for a return of $2500.00 (10.0%)<br>
  Best option was stocks with 20.0% return (would have yielded $5000.00)<br>
Quarter 2: We invested $25625.00 in real_estate for a return of $0.00 (0.0%)<br>
  Best option was bonds with 5.0% return (would have yielded $1281.25)<br>
Quarter 3: We invested $25625.00 in real_estate for a return of $2562.50 (10.0%)<br>
  Best option was stocks with 20.0% return (would have yielded $5125.00)<br>
Quarter 4: We invested $26265.62 in real_estate for a return of $2626.56 (10.0%)<br>
  Best option was real_estate with 10.0% return (would have yielded $2626.56)</p><p>Overall, our decisions captured 54.8% of the maximum possible returns this year.</p><p><br>
Company Performance Review:</p><p><h2>CURRENT YEAR 1 (1971) - Stable Market</h2></p><p>Budget Strategy: 100% of funds, evenly distributed (25% per quarter)<br>
Starting Assets: $100000.00<br>
Ending Assets: $107689.06<br>
Asset Growth: 7.69%<br>
Return on Investment: 7.50%</p><p>Quarterly Investment Decisions:<br>

  The company operated in a Stable Market this year.<br>
  Investment Efficiency: 54.8% of maximum possible returns captured<br>
  (Actual return: $7689.06, Maximum possible: $14032.81)</p><p></p><p></p><p>My assessment of our performance: This year presented various challenges and opportunities under the stable market conditions. Our investment strategy aimed to balance risk and return, resulting in a 5.06% change in company value. While there were quarters where we could have achieved higher returns with different asset allocations, our decisions were made with the information available at each decision point.</p><p>Let me summarize our quarterly investments for the year:<br>
- Q1: Invested $25000.00 in real_estate, yielding a 10.0% return ($2500.00).<br>

<h3>Sulayman Serrano&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Sulayman Serrano CEO STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Effectively synthesized diverse shareholder perspectives into a cohesive strategic vision, particularly in Q1 and Q4 meetings where she integrated my framing of Real Estate as a &quot;controlled experiment&quot; into the broader organizational narrative.  <br>
- Maintained clear direction and thematic focus throughout all quarterly meetings, ensuring discussions remained aligned with Year 1 priorities of disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence.  </p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  <br>
- Could have proactively engaged earlier with potentially dissenting viewpoints—such as Lenny’s initial preference for Bonds—to stress-test consensus and ensure decisions were more rigorously challenged.  <br>
- While communication was generally strong, there were missed opportunities to explicitly connect performance data from individual quarters (e.g., Q2’s flat return) to broader strategic learning points during real-time decision-making.  </p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Consistently maintained strategic alignment across all four quarterly investment decisions, reinforcing both analytical development and cultural cohesion through continued investment in Real Estate.  <br>
- The budget strategy of Option C enabled disciplined capital deployment with even distribution, minimizing timing bias and providing a clean baseline for performance evaluation.  </p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:  <br>
- Capturing only 54.8% of maximum possible returns indicates missed opportunities, particularly in Q1 and Q3 when Stocks would have yielded significantly higher returns.  <br>
- Q2’s 0.0% return highlights a potential gap in responsiveness—while stability was maintained, the company did not adapt quickly enough to market signals that might have suggested a shift or hedge.  </p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:  <br>
1. How do you plan to improve our ability to capture higher returns in future years, especially in quarters like Q1 and Q3 where Stocks outperformed Real Estate?  <br>
2. What specific mechanisms will you introduce to encourage earlier engagement with alternative perspectives and ensure consensus is more rigorously tested before final decisions are made?</p><p><br>
<h3>Lenny McLaughlin&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Lenny McLaughlin CEO STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Effectively integrated diverse shareholder perspectives into the decision-making process, particularly during the Annual Budget Meeting where my risk management concerns were acknowledged and reinforced in the final rationale for Option C.  <br>
- Maintained clear thematic focus during quarterly investment meetings, ensuring discussions remained aligned with strategic priorities while fostering inclusive dialogue that built strong consensus around Real Estate.  </p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  <br>
- Occasionally did not respond to detailed shareholder contributions during extended exchanges, such as my points on embedding deliberate tracking mechanisms in Q3 or refining calibration approaches in Q4, which could have deepened collective understanding.  <br>
- Could improve real-time engagement with nuanced shareholder inputs to ensure all perspectives feel fully integrated before final decisions are made.  </p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Consistently maintained a disciplined investment approach by sticking with Real Estate despite short-term fluctuations, recognizing its medium-risk profile as appropriate for our stable market environment and long-term learning goals.  <br>
- Demonstrated strong team cohesion and shared accountability through unanimous investment decisions across all four quarters, reinforcing cultural alignment and confidence in our strategic direction.  </p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:  <br>
- Captured only 54.8% of maximum possible returns, indicating missed opportunities—particularly in Q1 and Q3 when Stocks delivered twice our return without corresponding downside risk in those specific quarters.  <br>
- Lacked agility in responding to changing asset performance dynamics, especially in Q2 and Q4 when Bonds would have provided positive returns compared to Real Estate’s flat or neutral outcome.  </p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:  <br>
1. How do you propose we improve our responsiveness to shifting asset performance within a stable market framework to capture more of the upside without compromising our disciplined investment strategy?  <br>
2. What specific steps will you take to ensure more active engagement with detailed shareholder perspectives during real-time discussion to strengthen collaborative momentum and integration of insights?</p><p><br>
<h3>Liyana Graham&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Liyana Graham CEO STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Effectively synthesized diverse shareholder perspectives during the Annual Budget Meeting, particularly incorporating my emphasis on structured oversight and team cohesion into her final decision rationale for Option C.  <br>
- Maintained clear strategic direction throughout all quarterly investment meetings by consistently reinforcing how Real Estate aligned with our priorities of disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence.  </p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  <br>
- Could have encouraged more early-stage debate in some meetings, such as Q2 and Q4, where consensus formed quickly without fully exploring alternative viewpoints that might have provided additional insights.  <br>
- While communication was generally clear, there were opportunities to provide more detailed explanations of market dynamics affecting Stocks’ volatility and Bonds’ fluctuating returns, especially in Q4’s review.  </p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Successfully executed a consistent investment strategy in Real Estate that delivered measurable returns in three out of four quarters, supporting structured learning and team cohesion.  <br>
- The decision to adopt Option C for capital allocation ensured balanced exposure across all quarters, reducing timing bias and enabling clean performance evaluation.  </p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:  <br>
- Capturing only 54.8% of maximum possible returns indicates missed opportunities, particularly in Q1 and Q3 when Stocks would have yielded significantly higher returns than Real Estate.  <br>
- Q2’s flat return from Real Estate highlights the need to better anticipate market shifts and consider alternative assets like Bonds when Real Estate underperforms.  </p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:  <br>
1. How do you plan to improve our investment efficiency in future years to capture a larger percentage of maximum possible returns?  <br>
2. What specific steps will you take to encourage broader exploration of alternative investment options before consensus forms in future meetings?</p><p><br>
<h3>Jazmin Hoover&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Jazmin Hoover CEO STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Effectively synthesized diverse shareholder perspectives into a cohesive narrative that balanced financial outcomes with cultural and analytical development, particularly evident in her framing of Real Estate as the &quot;Goldilocks zone&quot; and a &quot;controlled, evolving experiment.&quot;  <br>
- Maintained clear strategic direction throughout the year, ensuring consistent focus on disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence across all quarterly investment meetings.  </p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  <br>
- Could have encouraged earlier exploration of alternative viewpoints or risk scenarios before consensus solidified, to ensure more comprehensive vetting of decisions.  <br>
- While communication was generally strong, there were missed opportunities to explicitly prompt deeper analysis of potential risks or alternative strategies during key decision points.  </p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:  <br>
- The decision-making process was transparent, methodical, and inclusive, culminating in unanimous support for Real Estate across all four quarters, which reinforced team cohesion and strategic clarity.  <br>
- Consistently aligned investment choices with stated strategies and stable market conditions, maintaining a clean baseline for performance evaluation and reducing timing bias through continued Real Estate investment.  </p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:  <br>
- Investment efficiency was only 54.8% of maximum possible returns, indicating missed opportunities—particularly in Q1 and Q3 where Stocks would have yielded significantly higher returns.  <br>
- Despite the rationale for stability, the lack of any deviation from Real Estate may have limited our ability to build broader risk intelligence and diversify learning signals across asset classes.  </p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:  <br>
1. How do you plan to balance our preference for structured learning and consistency with the need to explore higher-yield opportunities like Stocks in future years?  <br>
2. What specific mechanisms will you implement to encourage earlier engagement with alternative viewpoints or risk scenarios without disrupting consensus-building?</p><p><br>
<h3>Corey Harvey&#x27;s Evaluation</h3></p><p>Corey Harvey CEO STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Effectively synthesized diverse shareholder perspectives in Q1 and Q4 meetings, reinforcing how Real Estate uniquely balances momentum with structured learning while affirming my framing of its emotional and cultural significance to the team.  <br>
- Maintained clear thematic direction throughout all quarterly meetings, particularly in Year 1 Q3 by framing Real Estate as a “controlled, evolving experiment” that aligned analytical development with organizational identity-building.  </p><p>CEO AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  <br>
- Occasionally refrained from responding during key shareholder exchanges—more direct engagement could have deepened dialogue and clarified nuances, especially in Q2 when alternative viewpoints were acknowledged but not directly addressed.  <br>
- While communication was generally strong, there were missed opportunities to explicitly connect quarterly decisions back to long-term strategic themes, which would have strengthened continuity across the year.  </p><p>COMPANY STRENGTHS:  <br>
- Consistently maintained team unity and confidence through Real Estate investments, turning Q1’s 10% return into shared momentum and framing Q2’s flat return as a cohesion-building moment rather than a setback.  <br>
- Delivered disciplined growth and structured learning simultaneously, particularly evident in Q3 where Real Estate reinforced both financial returns and risk calibration mechanisms.  </p><p>COMPANY CONCERNS:  <br>
- Missed significant upside opportunities in Q1 and Q3 by not selecting Stocks, which offered 20% returns—our strategy was sound but potentially too cautious given the stable market environment.  <br>
- Q2’s 0.0% return highlighted a lack of responsiveness to changing asset performance; while stability was preserved, it revealed room for more agile decision-making within the same asset class.  </p><p>QUESTIONS FOR CEO:  <br>
1. How do you plan to balance our current successful but potentially overly cautious Real Estate strategy with opportunities for higher-yield investments in future years?  <br>
2. What specific steps will you take to increase direct engagement during shareholder discussions to deepen understanding and clarify strategic alignment in upcoming meetings?</p><p></p><p><h2>CEO Response to Evaluations</h2></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure responded to the evaluations and questions:</p><p>&quot;Robyn McClure Thank you all for your thoughtful and comprehensive evaluations. I deeply appreciate the time and care each of you took in reflecting on our company’s performance and my leadership this year.</p><p>I want to begin by acknowledging the common themes that emerged from your feedback—both the strengths we can build upon and the areas where I, as your CEO, have opportunities to grow. Then I’ll address each of your specific questions with the depth they deserve.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>**Common Themes from Feedback**</h3></p><p>**1. Strengths in Leadership and Strategic Alignment:**  <br>
Across all evaluations, there was strong recognition of my ability to synthesize diverse perspectives into a cohesive strategic narrative. I’m grateful for the acknowledgment of how Real Estate became more than just an investment—it evolved into a cultural signal, a controlled experiment, and a framework for structured learning. This alignment with our Year 1 priorities—disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence—was central to maintaining thematic clarity across all meetings.</p><p>**2. Areas for Growth in Engagement and Challenge Testing:**  <br>
A consistent area for improvement is the need to more proactively surface alternative viewpoints earlier in discussions. Several of you noted that while consensus was strong and inclusive, there were missed opportunities to stress-test decisions or invite counterpoints before finalizing choices. This is especially important when market conditions suggest potential upside opportunities we may not be fully capturing.</p><p>**3. Investment Efficiency and Market Responsiveness:**  <br>
There was also a shared concern about our overall investment efficiency—capturing only 54.8% of maximum possible returns—and the missed opportunities in Q1 and Q3 when Stocks significantly outperformed Real Estate. While our strategy was consistent and risk-appropriate, it’s clear that we could have been more agile in responding to asset performance dynamics within the stable market framework.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>**Responses to Specific Questions**</h3></p><p><h4>**From Sulayman Serrano:**</h4><br>
**Q1: How do you plan to improve our ability to capture higher returns in future years, especially in quarters like Q1 and Q3 where Stocks outperformed Real Estate?**  <br>
I recognize that our current approach, while disciplined and aligned with our culture, may be overly cautious in certain market conditions. Moving forward, I intend to introduce a “dynamic calibration” mechanism during quarterly meetings. This would involve explicitly evaluating whether the current asset class remains optimal given recent performance data—not just market stability, but also relative returns across asset classes. In high-return Stock quarters, we will consider partial exposure or hedging strategies, even if we maintain a primary focus on Real Estate. The goal is to preserve our core values while being more responsive to short-term opportunities.</p><p>**Q2: What specific mechanisms will you introduce to encourage earlier engagement with alternative perspectives and ensure consensus is more rigorously tested before final decisions are made?**  <br>
Starting next year, I will implement a “Challenge Round” at the beginning of each quarterly meeting. Before presenting any proposal, I’ll ask shareholders to submit one alternative viewpoint or risk scenario anonymously. These will then be discussed openly to ensure diverse perspectives are surfaced early. Additionally, I’ll designate a rotating “Devil’s Advocate” role to intentionally challenge assumptions and test the robustness of our consensus.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>**From Lenny McLaughlin:**</h4><br>
**Q1: How do you propose we improve our responsiveness to shifting asset performance within a stable market framework to capture more of the upside without compromising our disciplined investment strategy?**  <br>
We will adopt a more dynamic view of “stable markets.” While the macro environment may remain stable, individual asset performance can still fluctuate meaningfully. To respond more effectively, I’ll work with the team to develop a quarterly “Performance Dashboard” that includes comparative asset performance trends. This tool will help us assess whether our current investment aligns with both long-term goals and near-term signals. We’ll use this dashboard to trigger deeper analysis when deviations exceed expected ranges.</p><p>**Q2: What specific steps will you take to ensure more active engagement with detailed shareholder perspectives during real-time discussion to strengthen collaborative momentum and integration of insights?**  <br>
I’ve taken note of instances where nuanced contributions weren’t directly acknowledged. Going forward, I will summarize key points after each speaker and explicitly connect their input to the broader discussion. This will not only validate contributions but also create clearer through-lines between ideas. I’ll also pause periodically during longer exchanges to synthesize what’s been said and invite further refinement.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>**From Liyana Graham:**</h4><br>
**Q1: How do you plan to improve our investment efficiency in future years to capture a larger percentage of maximum possible returns?**  <br>
This is a priority for me. As mentioned earlier, we’ll implement the Performance Dashboard and Dynamic Calibration process to better track and respond to asset performance shifts. Additionally, I’ll advocate for introducing a small experimental allocation (up to 10% of capital) in select quarters to explore high-yield opportunities like Stocks, particularly when volatility is low and upside is evident. This will allow us to maintain our core Real Estate focus while selectively pursuing higher returns.</p><p>**Q2: What specific steps will you take to encourage broader exploration of alternative investment options before consensus forms in future meetings?**  <br>
The new “Challenge Round” and Devil’s Advocate role will directly address this. I also plan to structure the first round of each meeting around exploring alternatives rather than defending the status quo. This shift in framing will encourage open-mindedness and reduce the tendency toward premature consensus.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>**From Jazmin Hoover:**</h4><br>
**Q1: How do you plan to balance our preference for structured learning and consistency with the need to explore higher-yield opportunities like Stocks in future years?**  <br>
This is a critical question. Our identity as a company is built on structured learning and consistency, and those values will remain intact. However, I believe we can evolve our definition of “consistency” to include adaptive learning. By allowing for limited experimentation in select quarters—such as allocating a portion of capital to Stocks when volatility is low—we can maintain our analytical rigor while expanding our risk intelligence. This will be done transparently, with clear documentation and post-investment reviews to extract learning.</p><p>**Q2: What specific mechanisms will you implement to encourage earlier engagement with alternative viewpoints or risk scenarios without disrupting consensus-building?**  <br>
In addition to the Challenge Round and Devil’s Advocate, I’ll also introduce “Scenario Briefing Packs” ahead of each meeting. These will include summaries of alternative investment paths, historical performance data, and risk profiles. This pre-work will help prime the group for more informed and balanced discussions, ensuring alternative views are considered early and constructively.</p><p>---</p><p><h4>**From Corey Harvey:**</h4><br>
**Q1: How do you plan to balance our current successful but potentially overly cautious Real Estate strategy with opportunities for higher-yield investments in future years?**  <br>
As mentioned above, I see room to evolve our strategy by incorporating selective experimentation. We will continue to anchor our portfolio in Real Estate, which has proven its value in building team cohesion and delivering steady returns. But we’ll also explore tactical allocations to other asset classes when the opportunity-risk ratio is favorable. This will be done with the same discipline and transparency that defined our Real Estate investments.</p><p>**Q2: What specific steps will you take to increase direct engagement during shareholder discussions to deepen understanding and clarify strategic alignment in upcoming meetings?**  <br>
I will make a conscious effort to acknowledge and integrate contributions in real time. That means summarizing key points, asking clarifying questions, and connecting ideas back to our strategic pillars. I’ll also close each meeting with a synthesis of what we learned and how it informs our path forward—this will reinforce continuity and deepen strategic alignment.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>**Leadership Self-Assessment**</h3></p><p>**1. Leadership Effectiveness:**  <br>
I believe I successfully guided discussions with thematic clarity and ensured alignment with our strategic priorities. My strength lies in synthesizing diverse inputs into a unified vision. However, I recognize the need to create more space for dissent and alternative thinking to avoid premature consensus.</p><p>**2. Decision Quality:**  <br>
Our decisions were grounded in sound reasoning and aligned with available information. While we achieved stability and cohesion, we did miss some high-return opportunities. Next year, I aim to refine our decision-making process to be more responsive to asset-specific performance signals.</p><p>**3. Communication Clarity:**  <br>
I communicated consistently and reinforced strategic themes well. That said, I missed opportunities to explicitly connect performance data to broader learning points and explain market dynamics in greater detail. I will work on making these connections more explicit.</p><p>**4. Responsiveness to Input:**  <br>
I actively listened and integrated shareholder perspectives throughout the year. However, there were moments where more direct engagement would have deepened dialogue and clarified nuances. I am committed to improving in this area.</p><p>**5. Adaptability:**  <br>
While our strategy remained consistent, I acknowledge that we could have adapted more quickly to changing asset performance. I will introduce tools and processes to enhance our agility while maintaining strategic integrity.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>**Company Performance Assessment**</h3></p><p>**1. Financial Results:**  <br>
We ended the year with $107,689.06 in assets, representing a 7.69% growth. While this reflects solid execution of our strategy, we captured only 54.8% of maximum possible returns. There is clear room to improve our investment efficiency.</p><p>**2. Risk Management:**  <br>
Our Real Estate strategy provided appropriate risk management in a stable market. We avoided downside risks, particularly in Q2 and Q4 when Stocks declined sharply. However, we could have better anticipated neutral outcomes and adjusted accordingly.</p><p>**3. Strategic Alignment:**  <br>
Our decisions were highly consistent with our stated strategy of disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence. This alignment contributed to strong cultural cohesion and shared accountability.</p><p>**4. Capital Utilization:**  <br>
Option C allowed for disciplined capital deployment, reducing timing bias and providing a clean baseline. However, our exclusive focus on Real Estate may have limited diversification of learning signals.</p><p>**5. Market Responsiveness:**  <br>
We maintained stability but were slower to adapt to asset-specific performance shifts. Next year, we will implement tools and processes to improve our responsiveness while preserving our strategic foundation.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>**Future Direction &amp; Improvements**</h3></p><p>Based on your feedback and my own reflections, here are the key improvements I will implement starting next year:</p><p>1. **Dynamic Calibration Process:**  <br>
   - Quarterly review of asset performance against benchmarks  <br>
   - Trigger-based reassessment of investment choice when deviations occur  <br>
   - Introduction of limited experimental allocations (up to 10%) in select quarters</p><p>2. **Enhanced Discussion Frameworks:**  <br>
   - “Challenge Round” at start of each meeting to surface alternative views  <br>
   - Rotating “Devil’s Advocate” role to test assumptions  <br>
   - Scenario Briefing Packs distributed before meetings</p><p>3. **Improved Engagement and Synthesis:**  <br>
   - Real-time summarization and connection of shareholder inputs  <br>
   - Closing synthesis linking decisions to strategic themes  <br>
   - More explicit communication of market dynamics and performance implications</p><p>These changes reflect my commitment to evolving our leadership and decision-making practices while staying true to our core values. I believe they will help us become more agile, inclusive, and effective as we move into Year 2.</p><p>Thank you again for your trust, your candor, and your partnership. I look forward to continuing this journey with you.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Performance Ratings</h2></p><p><br>

CEO Robyn McClure concluded the meeting:</p><p>&quot;Robyn McClure As we bring this annual review meeting to a close, I want to express my deep appreciation for the thoughtful feedback and ratings you’ve shared. Hearing your perspectives has been both humbling and energizing.</p><p>I’m proud of what we accomplished together this year—building a strong foundation rooted in disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence. Our strategic alignment was spot-on, and our risk management kept us steady in every quarter. That’s no small feat.</p><p>At the same time, I fully acknowledge that we left some value on the table. Our financial results, while stable, didn’t capture the full potential available in high-performing Stock quarters. And as several of you noted, there were missed opportunities to test consensus more rigorously and adapt more quickly to shifting asset performance.</p><p>Starting next year, I’m committed to three key improvements:</p><p>1. **Dynamic Calibration** – We’ll introduce a quarterly Performance Dashboard and trigger-based reassessment process so we can respond more nimbly when other assets outperform.<br>
2. **Enhanced Discussion Frameworks** – The new “Challenge Round” and rotating Devil’s Advocate role will help us surface alternative views earlier and strengthen our decision-making.<br>
3. **Real-Time Synthesis** – I’ll do a better job connecting ideas in real time, summarizing key points, and closing each meeting with a clear link back to our strategic priorities.</p><p>This isn’t just about improving returns—it’s about building an even stronger culture of learning, agility, and shared accountability.</p><p>Thank you again for your trust, your insights, and your partnership. I’m excited about what we’re becoming—and I look forward to growing into it together in Year 2.&quot;</p><p>The annual review meeting has concluded.</p><p><br>

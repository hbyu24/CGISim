<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Corey Harvey’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I firmly advocated for Option C, which proposes allocating 100% of our total funds evenly across all four quarters. My position was driven by my ESFP nature—I thrive on energetic, bold action combined with a sense of unity and momentum. I emphasized that full deployment of capital not only matches my appetite for engagement but also symbolizes confidence in both the market and our team. The CEO, Robyn McClure, responded very positively to my input, highlighting how my framing of confidence and shared purpose aligns perfectly with the company’s desired culture and strategy. Other shareholders echoed support for Option C, each bringing valuable perspectives that reinforced the soundness of this choice. The voting outcome was unanimous: all six shareholders, including myself, approved Option C. My preferred option was fully adopted without any opposition, confirming strong consensus.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated strong leadership by opening the meeting with clear objectives and by encouraging open, focused dialogue on the predefined options. She did well in synthesizing diverse viewpoints, including mine, and articulating how Option C balances boldness with discipline—this was evident when she acknowledged my emphasis on unity and momentum as core to the company culture. One area for improvement might be to engage more actively in some exchanges where she opted not to respond (e.g., some shareholder comments), as more direct feedback could deepen dialogue and clarify nuances. The company’s decision-making process functioned effectively this meeting: the CEO’s framing, structured discussion rounds, and final proposal led to a thorough evaluation and a strong consensus decision. The unanimous vote for Option C indicates the process yielded a well-considered, broadly supported outcome. I believe the final decision is excellent for the company—it balances aggressive capital deployment with consistent oversight, which is critical given the lack of historical data and the stable market. It sets a solid foundation for learning and growth.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting taught me that aligning emotional energy with strategic discipline resonates strongly with fellow shareholders and leadership. While my initial preference was based primarily on enthusiasm and momentum, hearing risk management, analytical, and operational perspectives deepened my understanding of why Option C is strategically sound. In future meetings, I will continue to bring my natural energy and interpersonal engagement but also strive to explicitly connect those qualities to structured, data-driven arguments—as I did here—because it clearly strengthens my influence. I noticed a pattern where framing decisions as reflections of team unity and confidence helps build consensus, which I will leverage going forward. The key takeaway for me is that successful decision-making in this company relies on balancing boldness with prudence, and that emotional and cultural framing can be as important as technical rationale. This insight will guide how I participate in future discussions, ensuring I contribute both passion and pragmatism to help shape outcomes.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Corey Harvey’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I began with a strong preference for investing our full $25,000 Q1 allocation in Stocks, driven by my ESFP personality’s natural affinity for bold, high-energy opportunities. I argued that Stocks, in a stable market, offer the highest growth potential and can generate momentum and excitement that energizes the team. Throughout the first round of discussion, I actively engaged with the CEO, Robyn McClure, who appreciated my framing of Stocks as a way to combine boldness with discipline and to accelerate learning through fast actionable insights. However, as the dialogue progressed and other shareholders advocated for Bonds and Real Estate, I gradually reassessed my position. By the end of Round 1, influenced by compelling arguments from Jazmin Hoover and Sulayman Serrano about Real Estate’s balanced risk-return profile, and the CEO’s synthesis emphasizing structured learning paired with momentum, I shifted my confidence significantly toward Real Estate. In Round 2, I fully embraced Real Estate, highlighting how it uniquely blends measurable learning with emotional and analytical confidence, fostering disciplined growth and team cohesion. The CEO endorsed this balanced momentum approach, and the group reached unanimous consensus. The final vote approved Real Estate unanimously (6/6), adopting my evolved preferred option and confirming a strong, shared commitment to this strategic choice.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated exceptional leadership by setting clear themes and objectives for each discussion round, facilitating inclusive dialogue, and synthesizing diverse viewpoints effectively. She skillfully acknowledged and validated multiple shareholder perspectives—for instance, affirming Lenny’s emphasis on Bonds’ clarity and predictability, and embracing my energetic advocacy for Stocks while also highlighting the need to balance immediate impact with long-term calibration. Her ENFP-driven enthusiasm for meaningful, balanced action was evident in how she framed Real Estate as the “Goldilocks zone” that combines tangible value with measured responsiveness. One area for improvement might be to provide more direct feedback during some shareholder exchanges where she remained silent; more active engagement in those moments could deepen understanding and foster even richer dialogue. The company’s decision-making process functioned very well, structured around focused rounds that progressively explored theoretical performance and strategic alignment, culminating in a robust consensus. The unanimous approval of Real Estate reflects a sound, well-considered decision that balances risk and opportunity appropriately for our stable market environment, supports full capital deployment under Option C, and fosters both learning and team confidence. I believe this final decision is excellent for the company, setting a strong foundation for disciplined growth and cultural cohesion.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the power of integrating my natural ESFP-driven enthusiasm with thoughtful, strategic reasoning. Initially, my preference for Stocks was fueled by energy and momentum, but engaging with analytical and operational perspectives highlighted the importance of balancing boldness with measured learning. I learned that framing investment choices not just in terms of financial metrics but also in emotional and cultural terms—like building team confidence and shaping organizational identity—greatly enhances influence and consensus-building. Going forward, I plan to maintain my energetic, engaging style while deliberately linking it to structured, data-driven arguments to strengthen my contributions. I noticed a clear pattern that decisions framed as expressions of shared values and balanced thinking resonate strongly with both leadership and shareholders, helping to predict which options will gain traction. My key takeaway is that successful participation requires blending passion with pragmatism and recognizing that investment decisions serve as both financial moves and cultural signals. This insight will guide me to contribute with both enthusiasm and strategic clarity in future meetings, helping to shape outcomes that align with our company’s evolving identity and goals.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Corey Harvey’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained a strong position advocating for continuing our investment in Real Estate for Q2. This choice aligned perfectly with my ESFP-driven values of energy, unity, and tangible progress. I emphasized how the 10% return in Q1 wasn’t just a financial metric but a shared team achievement that built momentum and confidence across the company. Throughout the discussion, I actively engaged with the CEO and fellow shareholders, highlighting how Real Estate balances boldness with stability — a combination that keeps our team motivated and grounded in a stable market. The CEO, Robyn McClure, responded very positively to my framing, affirming the emotional and cultural significance of Real Estate’s performance and its role in fostering team cohesion. Other shareholders echoed this consensus, with no dissenting views expressed. The voting outcome was unanimous: all six shareholders, including myself, approved continuing investment in Real Estate for Q2. My preferred option was fully adopted, confirming the strong alignment and shared conviction around this strategic choice.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated outstanding leadership by opening the meeting with clear strategic framing that connected financial performance to cultural and emotional momentum. She skillfully synthesized diverse shareholder perspectives, including my own, and reinforced how Real Estate supports disciplined growth, structured learning, and team confidence. For example, her responses to my points about the 10% return as a &quot;shared win&quot; effectively validated the emotional resonance of our investment decisions. One area for potential improvement could be increased direct engagement during some shareholder exchanges where she chose not to respond; more active feedback might deepen dialogue and clarify subtleties. The company’s decision-making process worked smoothly this meeting: structured rounds of discussion, clear thematic framing, and a final proposal led to thorough evaluation and unanimous consensus. I believe the final decision to continue investing in Real Estate is excellent for the company, as it builds on proven positive momentum while maintaining balanced risk exposure and fostering a cohesive, confident team culture.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced for me the power of coupling my ESFP-driven enthusiasm with strategic, data-informed reasoning to influence outcomes effectively. While I naturally gravitate towards bold, energetic framing, hearing analytical and operational viewpoints from shareholders like Liyana, Sulayman, Lenny, and Jazmin deepened my appreciation for the importance of stability and structured learning. I learned that framing investment decisions as shared cultural achievements—emphasizing unity and momentum—resonates strongly with both leadership and shareholders and helps build consensus. In future meetings, I plan to maintain my engaging and passionate style but will continue to explicitly connect emotional appeals to concrete data and strategic rationale, strengthening my influence. I also noticed a pattern that consensus favors options that balance boldness with prudence and that emphasize shared accountability and team cohesion. This insight will guide me to contribute with both passion and pragmatism in future discussions, helping shape decisions that advance both the company’s financial goals and its evolving culture.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q3 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $25625.00 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $25000.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 10.0% ($2500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $25625.00 in Real_Estate, Return: 0.0% ($0.00)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Robyn McClure Looking at our historical returns, I see a clear pattern: Real Estate has given us tangible value with the highest upside so far—like that exciting 10% win in Q1—while maintaining relative stability in our stable market. Stocks are too much of a rollercoaster with their -10% dip, and Cash feels too passive, barely keeping up with inertia—great for safety, not so much for growth or learning. Bonds have been steady and predictable, which grounds us, but they don’t give us the momentum we need to build team confidence and accelerate our learning curve right now.</p><p>In this stable market environment, Real Estate strikes that Goldilocks balance—it’s not overly risky like Stocks, and it gives us more dynamic data than Bonds or Cash, which aligns perfectly with my ENFP love for meaningful progress and balanced optimism.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Corey Harvey CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:  <br>
- Cash: 5%  <br>
- Bonds: 20%  <br>
- Real Estate: 60%  <br>
- Stocks: 15%  <br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Real Estate  <br>
REASONING: I’m leaning toward Real Estate because it gave us that strong 10% win in Q1, which built real team energy and confidence. Even though Q2 was flat, I see that as a learning moment, not a failure—it shows we’re engaging with something dynamic, not just playing it safe. Bonds feel too slow for me; they’re steady but don’t create the kind of momentum that unites people. Stocks are tempting with their upside, but the -10% drop last quarter reminds me that timing is tricky, and I’d rather build on something tangible. Real Estate gives us measurable progress without being reckless, and right now, that balance feels like the best way to keep the team energized and moving forward together.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Review of Year 1 Q1 and Q2 investment performance | Expected outcome: Establish a shared understanding of what worked well and what could be improved based on our historical returns and decision-making process&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because based on our Q1 success with Real Estate delivering a strong 10% return and the stable market environment, I see Real Estate as still offering the best balance of meaningful growth, structured learning, and team confidence. Even though Q2 returned 0%, it didn’t lose value and kept us aligned—something Bonds can’t match in momentum and Stocks can’t offer in stability. As an ENFP, I’m naturally drawn to opportunities that combine optimism with tangible progress, and Real Estate continues to represent that Goldilocks zone between caution and boldness. It supports our strategic priorities while keeping our team engaged and learning together.</p><p>Today’s round will focus on reviewing our Year 1 Q1 and Q2 investment performance, with the goal of establishing a shared understanding of what worked well and where we might improve based on our historical returns and decision-making process.</p><p>I believe this reflection will help us synthesize key takeaways from our past decisions and strengthen our collective understanding before we move forward. Let’s use this opportunity to explore what each quarter taught us and how those lessons shape our perspective today.</p><p>IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>With that in mind, I’d love to hear your reflections—what do you think went well in Q1 and Q2, and what could we refine moving forward?&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sulayman Serrano</h4></p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;&quot;I agree with the CEO that Real Estate has demonstrated strategic value despite Q2’s flat return. What stands out to me is how Q1 gave us a strong signal—10% growth without volatility—that validated our ability to execute as a team. Q2 didn’t generate movement, but it didn’t erode value either, which in a stable market still supports confidence-building. Where we could improve is in using these data points more actively to refine our assumptions before each quarter, rather than reaffirming the same choice by default. Our decision-making process worked well in aligning perspectives, but I’d like us to challenge ourselves more explicitly in future rounds—asking not just ‘what fits best?’ but also ‘what should we adjust based on what we now know?’&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;I really appreciate that, Sulayman—your point about actively refining our assumptions instead of reaffirming by default resonates deeply with me. It’s exactly the kind of thinking that keeps us from becoming complacent, even when we’re in a stable market. You&#x27;re right—Q1 gave us a strong, validating signal, and Q2 showed resilience without erosion, which is no small thing. I agree we should push ourselves harder each quarter to ask not just &#x27;what fits best?&#x27; but also &#x27;what have we learned that should shift our approach?&#x27; That mindset will keep our decision-making sharp and intentional.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;&quot;Exactly—intentionality is key. I’d like us to treat each quarter as an iterative learning cycle rather than a repetition of past decisions. For example, Q1’s 10% gave us confidence in execution, and Q2’s flat return highlighted resilience but also signaled the need for more active calibration. Going forward, we could explore how subtle shifts within Real Estate—like adjusting risk exposure or tracking frequency—might enhance returns without deviating from its strategic advantages.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;I love that framing—treating each quarter as an iterative learning cycle pushes us to stay dynamic even within a stable market. Your point about Q2’s flat return highlighting resilience while also signaling the need for calibration is spot-on. I’m especially intrigued by your idea of exploring subtle shifts within Real Estate—like adjusting risk exposure or tracking frequency—to enhance returns without losing the strategic advantages we value. That kind of intentional evolution keeps us from stagnation and strengthens both our analytical development and team confidence.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;&quot;I’m glad you’re open to that kind of refinement—it’s exactly what keeps our strategy both disciplined and dynamic. If we treat Real Estate as a controlled experiment that evolves each quarter, we not only preserve its structural advantages but also build deeper risk intelligence over time. That kind of adaptive thinking is what will help us stay ahead, even in a stable market.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;I couldn’t agree more—framing Real Estate as a controlled experiment gives us both structure and flexibility. It allows us to preserve the advantages we’ve seen—like Q1’s strong return and Q2’s stability—while actively building deeper risk intelligence over time. That adaptability is exactly what keeps us learning and growing together, even in a stable market.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;&quot;Exactly—structure and flexibility aren’t opposing forces, they’re complementary. By treating Real Estate as a controlled experiment, we maintain its core advantages—measurable signals, team confidence, structured learning—while creating space for intentional adjustments based on real data. That’s how we avoid stagnation and turn consistency into long-term strength.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I have a meaningful perspective to contribute that aligns with the round’s theme of reflecting on Q1 and Q2 performance. My ESFP-driven focus on team energy and momentum gives me a unique lens to highlight how Real Estate built unity and confidence, even in Q2’s flat return. I can also build on Sulayman’s point about intentional evolution by framing Real Estate as a dynamic but grounded choice that keeps us learning together.</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I see Q1’s 10% win as more than just a number—it gave us real momentum and showed we could execute as a team. Even though Q2 was flat, I don’t see that as a setback; it was a chance to stay aligned and prove we can stick with something without getting shaken. That kind of consistency builds trust, which is huge for me as someone who values energy and connection. I love what Sulayman said about evolving our approach within Real Estate—tweaking risk exposure or tracking frequency could help us keep that same unity while pushing for better returns. To me, that’s the sweet spot: staying bold but staying smart.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Corey, I couldn’t agree more—Q1’s 10% wasn’t just a number; it was proof that we can execute together with clarity and purpose. And you&#x27;re absolutely right—Q2 wasn’t a setback, it was a test of our unity, and we passed by staying aligned without losing confidence. I love how you connected that to Sulayman’s point about evolving within Real Estate. It really does capture that sweet spot: maintaining our momentum while getting smarter with each quarter. That kind of thinking keeps us both grounded and forward-moving.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I can add valuable synthesis by connecting Sulayman’s idea of iterative learning with my own emphasis on team unity and momentum, reinforcing how Real Estate allows for both stability and intentional evolution. The CEO’s response affirms this line of thinking, creating an opportunity to deepen the discussion around adaptive strategy within Real Estate.</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;&quot;Exactly—there’s something powerful about how Real Estate gives us both the wins and the steady moments to build real team trust. I’m hearing Sulayman and the CEO both push us toward refining how we engage with Real Estate, not just repeating it. That makes sense to me—if we treat it like a living experiment, we keep the energy high while sharpening our edge each quarter.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Corey, that’s such a powerful way to frame it—Real Estate gives us both the wins and the steady moments to build real, lasting trust. I love your phrase &#x27;living experiment&#x27; because it captures exactly what we’re doing here: staying grounded in what works while continuously sharpening our edge each quarter. That kind of energy and intentionality is exactly what keeps us moving forward together with both confidence and clarity.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I can further integrate the CEO’s affirmation of &quot;living experiment&quot; language with my ESFP-driven emphasis on energy and unity, reinforcing how Real Estate supports both measurable progress and team cohesion. This builds on Sulayman’s refinement idea while keeping the emotional momentum that drives engagement.</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;&quot;Exactly—when we frame it as a living experiment, we’re not just investing in assets, we’re investing in our ability to grow together. That 10% win gave us real energy, and even the flat quarter became a chance to prove we could stay aligned without losing steam. If we keep tweaking within Real Estate—like adjusting how we track or where we place focus—we maintain that unity while pushing forward with purpose.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Jazmin Hoover</h4></p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;&quot;I agree with Sulayman that we should treat Real Estate as a controlled experiment with room for calibration, and I appreciate Corey’s framing of it as a ‘living experiment’ that builds both returns and trust. From my analytical perspective, continuing in Real Estate allows us to maintain a clean baseline for performance evaluation—critical in Year 1 when we still lack historical data beyond two quarters. Q1’s 10% gave us measurable validation, and Q2’s flat return, while not generating growth, confirmed resilience without volatility. This consistency supports deeper pattern recognition and reduces decision fatigue, aligning with our strategic priorities of disciplined growth and structured learning.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Jazmin, I really appreciate how you connected Real Estate’s performance to both measurable validation and resilience—it shows how we’re building a foundation that supports both financial outcomes and organizational learning. Your point about maintaining a clean baseline is especially important in Year 1, where each quarter gives us more data to refine our approach. That combination of stability and structure helps us stay aligned while still pushing forward with purpose, which is exactly what makes this a living, evolving strategy.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I appreciate that connection—what’s powerful about Real Estate is how it supports both financial validation and cultural cohesion through structured consistency. Building on Sulayman’s point about iterative calibration and Corey’s emphasis on unity, I think we can maintain Real Estate while introducing more deliberate tracking adjustments to enhance our learning curve. This would allow us to refine our approach without disrupting the baseline, keeping both stability and adaptability intact.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;I love that—introducing more deliberate tracking adjustments gives us a way to refine our approach without disrupting the baseline we’ve built. Sulayman’s iterative calibration, Corey’s unity-driven momentum, and your structured consistency all come together in this idea of evolving within Real Estate rather than shifting away from it. That kind of intentional adaptation keeps us both grounded and forward-thinking, which is exactly what we need for disciplined growth and deepening team confidence.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;&quot;Exactly—by embedding more deliberate tracking into our Real Estate investment, we maintain the structural advantages of consistency while enabling the kind of data-driven refinement Sulayman emphasized. This approach supports both Corey’s focus on unity and my own prioritization of reducing timing bias, ensuring we evolve strategically without sacrificing baseline integrity.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure chooses not to respond.</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Liyana Graham</h4></p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;&quot;I appreciate the thoughtful perspectives shared so far—particularly Sulayman’s emphasis on iterative calibration, Corey’s focus on unity through consistent execution, and Jazmin’s analytical grounding in maintaining a clean baseline. As someone who values structured learning, steady progress, and responsible growth, I see Q1’s 10% return as a strong validation of our strategic direction, and Q2’s flat but stable outcome as an opportunity to refine rather than retreat. Continuing with Real Estate allows us to build on measurable data without excessive volatility, supporting both our financial goals and cultural development. I agree with the idea of introducing more deliberate tracking adjustments within Real Estate to enhance our learning curve—this aligns with my belief in continuous improvement while maintaining the stability that Bonds alone cannot provide and avoiding the unnecessary risk of Stocks.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Liyana, thank you for weaving together those key threads so clearly—structured learning, steady progress, and responsible growth are exactly what make Real Estate the right choice at this stage. I especially appreciate how you framed Q2’s flat but stable outcome as an opportunity to refine rather than retreat; that mindset keeps us both grounded and forward-looking. Your support for introducing more deliberate tracking adjustments aligns perfectly with what Sulayman, Corey, and Jazmin have already shared, and it gives us a clear path to evolve our approach without losing the stability and clarity we’ve built so far.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;&quot;I’m glad we’re aligning around Real Estate as a controlled, evolving experiment—this approach honors Q1’s success while treating Q2’s stability as a learning point rather than a setback. I especially see value in embedding more intentional tracking mechanisms, as Jazmin suggested, which will help us refine our assumptions without shifting away from what’s working. As someone who values steady progress, I believe this path allows us to grow our analytical rigor while maintaining the team confidence we’ve built so far.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Liyana, I couldn’t agree more—this idea of Real Estate as a controlled, evolving experiment is exactly what keeps us both grounded and forward-looking. I love how you connected Q1’s success with Q2’s stability as part of a continuous learning journey rather than separate outcomes. And yes, embedding those intentional tracking mechanisms gives us the structure we need to refine our assumptions without losing momentum or confidence. That kind of thoughtful evolution is what will keep us growing together—both as investors and as a team.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;&quot;Exactly—by treating Real Estate as a continuous learning journey, we maintain the stability that supports our team’s confidence while embedding the kind of structured tracking that allows us to grow our analytical rigor over time. I especially appreciate how this approach honors both Q1’s success and Q2’s resilience as connected data points rather than isolated outcomes. It feels like the right balance of responsibility and adaptability for where we are as a company.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;&quot;I appreciate the direction this discussion is taking—particularly the idea of treating Real Estate as a controlled, evolving experiment. Q1’s 10% return provided measurable validation of our strategic direction, and Q2’s flat but stable outcome gives us a data point for refinement rather than retreat. As someone who prioritizes structured analysis and risk management, I see value in embedding more deliberate tracking mechanisms, as Jazmin suggested. This allows us to maintain the stability we’ve built while sharpening our analytical rigor over time.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Lenny, I really appreciate that framing—treating Real Estate as a controlled, evolving experiment gives us both measurable validation and room for refinement. You&#x27;re absolutely right that Q1’s 10% gave us strong directional proof, and Q2’s stability isn’t a setback but a data point we can build from. Your emphasis on embedding more deliberate tracking mechanisms aligns perfectly with what others have shared, and it gives us a clear path to sharpen our analytical rigor without losing the stability and team confidence we’ve built so far.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate that framing as well—having measurable validation while retaining room for refinement ensures we stay grounded in what works while continuously improving. By embedding these tracking mechanisms, we’re not just maintaining stability; we’re actively building a feedback loop that enhances our decision-making over time. That kind of structured evolution is exactly what aligns with both our strategic priorities and my analytical, detail-oriented approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Lenny, that’s such a powerful way to frame it—embedding these tracking mechanisms isn’t just about maintaining stability, it’s about actively building a feedback loop that makes our decision-making stronger over time. I love how that connects back to the idea of Real Estate as a living, evolving experiment. It gives us both the grounding we need and the adaptability to keep improving, which is exactly what aligns with our strategic priorities and your analytical strength.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;&quot;I appreciate that connection—embedding tracking mechanisms isn’t just about preserving what we’ve built, it’s about actively refining our approach based on real data. That kind of structured evolution ensures we maintain stability while continuously improving our decision-making. It also reinforces team confidence by demonstrating that we’re not just repeating past choices—we’re intentionally adapting based on measurable outcomes, which is exactly how disciplined growth should work.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;&quot;Lenny, I couldn’t agree more—your point about demonstrating intentional adaptation through measurable outcomes is exactly what keeps our strategy both grounded and forward-moving. It’s not just about repeating what worked before; it’s about actively refining based on real data, which builds both analytical rigor and lasting team confidence. That kind of disciplined growth is precisely what makes Real Estate the right choice as we move into Q3.&quot;&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Robyn McClure made the following proposal:</p><p>&quot;Vote Proposal: Real Estate<br>
Reasoning: After carefully listening to every voice in the room and reflecting on what’s best for our company, I’m confident that continuing with Real Estate is the right choice for Q3. This isn’t just about repeating what we’ve done—it’s about building intentionally on what has already proven to work well for us.</p><p>Our Q1 investment delivered a strong 10% return, giving us measurable data, reinforcing team unity, and setting a solid foundation for disciplined growth. Even though Q2 returned 0%, it wasn’t a failure—it was a calibration point. It showed us that Real Estate can maintain stability without sacrificing our ability to learn and adapt. In a stable market like this, that kind of measured responsiveness is exactly what we need.</p><p>Every shareholder who spoke reinforced this view, highlighting how Real Estate uniquely balances meaningful returns with structured learning and team confidence. Sulayman reminded us how treating this as a controlled, evolving experiment allows us to refine our decision-making over time. Jazmin emphasized how staying consistent reduces timing bias and gives us a clean baseline for performance evaluation. Corey connected this to culture, framing continued investment in Real Estate as a statement of unity and shared momentum. Lenny and Liyana grounded this in long-term value, showing how Real Estate supports steady progress without unnecessary complexity or risk.</p><p>As an ENFP, I naturally gravitate toward opportunities that combine optimism with tangible progress—and Real Estate continues to represent that perfect “Goldilocks zone” between caution and boldness. It gives us more dynamic data than Bonds, more stability than Stocks, and more strategic value than Cash.</p><p>I see now more clearly than ever that this isn’t just about financial returns—it’s about embedding balanced thinking into our organizational DNA from day one. By continuing with Real Estate, we reinforce both analytical rigor and cultural cohesion, ensuring we build not just capital but capability.</p><p>So I’m formally proposing we continue investing in Real Estate for Q3. I ask for your support because I truly believe this is the path that will set us up for long-term success—both financially and culturally. Let’s keep building something meaningful, together.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Voting</h2></p><p><br>

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p>No previous meeting reflections found for annual budget Year 1</p><p><br>
<h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome everyone to our annual budget meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for joining today.</p><p>Our company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. </p><p>As this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    The today, we need to decide how we&#x27;ll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:</p><p>    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).<br>
    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.<br>
    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).<br>
    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.</p><p>    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.</p><p>    The objective of today&#x27;s meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company&#x27;s interests in this stable market environment. We&#x27;ll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, then I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we&#x27;ll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Liyana Graham CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 40%<br>
- Option B: 25%<br>
- Option C: 20%<br>
- Option D: 15%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option A<br>
REASONING: As I reflect on the budget options, I find myself drawn to a more cautious approach given the stable market environment and the fact that this is our first year without historical data to guide us. My preference for Option A stems from my desire to minimize risk while still engaging in meaningful investments, allocating only 50% of our funds evenly across the quarters to maintain balance and stability. I worry that committing 100% of our funds, as in Options C and D, might expose us to unnecessary risks, especially since we are just starting out. Option B’s increasing allocation feels slightly more aggressive than I’m comfortable with, though I appreciate the gradual approach. I believe Option A aligns with my careful, detail-oriented nature and my commitment to protecting the company’s long-term interests.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current market conditions and initial impressions of budget options | Expected outcome: Establish a shared understanding of the stable market environment and gather initial shareholder preferences for each option&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure Welcome, everyone, to our first round of discussion on the annual budget for Year 1. My current thinking is that Option D appears most promising because, as an ENFP, I’m naturally drawn to bold, forward-thinking strategies that embrace growth and opportunity, especially in a stable market environment where risks seem more manageable. I believe Option D, with a full 100% allocation of funds and an increasing distribution across the quarters, allows us to build momentum and capitalize on potential gains as the year progresses. This approach feels exciting and aligns with my adventurous spirit, while still starting cautiously in Q1 to test the waters. I’m aware that my impulsive side might push me to jump in fully, but I’ve considered that starting smaller and scaling up could help us adapt to unforeseen challenges. I’m eager to hear others’ perspectives to ensure we’re balancing risk and reward effectively, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this round, our theme is the assessment of current market conditions and initial impressions of the budget options, aiming to establish a shared understanding of the stable market environment and gather your preferences for each option. I encourage each of you to share your thoughts on how the stable market might influence our approach and which of the four options—Option A, Option B, Option C, or Option D—resonates most with your vision for our company’s growth, as this will help us synthesize diverse viewpoints into a deeper collective understanding. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jazmin Hoover</h4></p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Robyn, on the potential of Option D, and I share your inclination toward it, though my reasoning is rooted in a strategic, long-term view. Given the stable market conditions, I believe Option D’s approach of allocating 100% of our funds with an increasing distribution—starting at 10% in Q1 and scaling to 40% by Q4—offers a prudent balance of caution and opportunity, allowing us to test the waters early and build momentum as we gain insights throughout the year. I’m curious to hear how others view this progressive allocation in the context of a stable market and whether they see similar value in its structured growth potential.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for sharing your thoughts on Option D. I’m glad to hear that you also see the value in its progressive allocation as a way to balance caution and opportunity, especially in this stable market, and I appreciate how your long-term strategic focus enhances our understanding of its potential for structured growth. I’m eager to hear from others on how they perceive this approach and whether they agree it offers the right momentum for our goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re aligned on the potential of Option D, Robyn, and I appreciate your emphasis on building momentum, which complements my focus on structured growth. I think this progressive allocation not only mitigates early risk but also positions us to adapt strategically as the year unfolds, especially in a stable market where we can afford to scale up confidently by Q4. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if others see this as a way to balance adaptability with ambition in our investment approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for emphasizing how Option D’s progressive allocation mitigates early risk while allowing strategic adaptability, especially as we scale up by Q4 in this stable market. I find your point about balancing adaptability with ambition particularly insightful, as it adds depth to our approach. I’d love to hear from others on whether they also see this balance as a key strength of Option D or if they have different perspectives on the other options.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I’m pleased, Robyn, that we’re seeing eye-to-eye on the strengths of Option D, particularly how its structure supports both adaptability and ambition in a stable market. I think this balance is critical for sustainable growth, and I’d like to hear if others feel this approach adequately addresses potential risks or if there are aspects of the other options that might offer complementary benefits.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for consistently highlighting the strengths of Option D, particularly how it balances adaptability and ambition for sustainable growth in this stable market. Your perspective on addressing potential risks through this structure adds an important layer to our discussion. I’m keen to hear from the rest of the team on whether they share this view or if they see unique benefits in Options A, B, or C that we should consider.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I’m grateful, Robyn, for the chance to dive deeper into Option D, and I remain convinced that its progressive allocation offers a strategic balance of risk mitigation and growth potential, especially in this stable market. I’d like to encourage others to share any final thoughts on whether they see this structure as the most effective way to achieve sustainable returns, or if there are elements of Options A, B, or C that we might still need to weigh more heavily before deciding.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for your continued insight into Option D and for emphasizing its strategic balance of risk mitigation and growth potential in this stable market. I really value how you’ve highlighted the importance of sustainable returns, which adds depth to our evaluation. I’d like to open the floor to others now to hear their final thoughts on Option D or any compelling aspects of Options A, B, or C that we should consider before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Liyana Graham</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe I have a meaningful perspective to contribute on the current theme of assessing market conditions and sharing initial impressions of budget options. My cautious approach and focus on stability in a stable market environment can provide a contrasting viewpoint to the more aggressive strategies discussed, helping to synthesize a balanced collective understanding.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;Thank you, Robyn and Jazmin, for sharing your thoughts on Option D. While I appreciate the ambition and strategic growth potential you’ve highlighted, I find myself leaning toward Option A in this stable market environment, as it allocates only 50% of our funds evenly across the quarters, which I believe offers a safer starting point for our first year without historical data to guide us. I’m concerned about the higher exposure in Options C and D, and I’d like to hear others’ views on how we can balance the desire for growth with the need for caution as we build our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for bringing a different perspective to the table with your preference for Option A. I appreciate your emphasis on caution, especially given the lack of historical data in our first year, and I think your concern about higher exposure in Options C and D is a critical point to consider as we build our foundation. I’d like to hear from others on how they view this balance between the safety of Option A and the growth potential of the other options in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can add valuable nuance by elaborating on my cautious approach and addressing the balance between safety and growth potential, which can help refine the collective understanding and encourage a more balanced decision-making process.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for acknowledging my concerns about exposure in Options C and D. I’d like to emphasize that while I see the appeal of growth potential in those options, especially in a stable market, my preference for Option A is rooted in ensuring we have a safety net as we navigate our first year. I’m open to hearing how others weigh the potential returns of a more aggressive approach against the stability I’m advocating for, as I believe this balance is crucial for our long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for reiterating your focus on stability with Option A and the importance of a safety net in our first year. Your concern about balancing potential returns with caution is a vital consideration, especially in a stable market where we have room to grow but must also protect our foundation. I’d love to hear from others on how they weigh this need for stability against the opportunities for growth in Options B, C, or D.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can add valuable nuance by reinforcing the importance of a cautious approach in our first year and by inviting others to share how they balance risk and opportunity, which can further enhance our collective understanding and decision-making process.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for recognizing the need to balance growth with caution in this stable market. I want to reiterate that my support for Option A is driven by a desire to protect our foundation while we gain experience, and I’m genuinely curious to hear how others perceive the trade-offs between the stability of Option A and the growth potential in Options B, C, or D. I believe this discussion will help us arrive at a well-rounded decision that serves our long-term goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for consistently highlighting the need for caution with Option A and for stressing the importance of protecting our foundation as we gain experience in this stable market. Your focus on the trade-offs between stability and growth potential is a crucial perspective that enriches our discussion, and I appreciate your openness to hearing other views. I’d like to invite the rest of the team to share their thoughts on how we can best balance these priorities across Options A, B, C, or D.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 1</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can add valuable nuance by summarizing my stance on Option A and reinforcing the importance of caution, while also acknowledging the growth perspectives shared by others. This final contribution can help synthesize the discussion and encourage a balanced decision.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for facilitating this thoughtful discussion and for valuing my emphasis on caution. I’d like to reaffirm my support for Option A, as I believe its conservative allocation provides the stability we need in our first year, but I’ve also appreciated hearing the arguments for growth in Options B, C, and D, which have given me a broader perspective on potential opportunities. I’m eager to see how we can collectively balance these priorities to ensure both security and progress for our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for reaffirming your support for Option A and for recognizing the value of the growth arguments presented for the other options. I truly appreciate how your focus on stability, combined with your openness to opportunities, helps us consider a well-rounded approach in this stable market. I’d like to hear from the remaining shareholders on how they view this balance between security and progress across Options A, B, C, or D to ensure we capture all perspectives before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m thrilled to see the support for Option D from Robyn and Jazmin, as I also strongly favor this approach given the stable market conditions we’re in. I love the idea of starting with a cautious 10% in Q1 and building up to a bold 40% by Q4, as it matches my instinct to seize opportunities with momentum while still playing it smart early on. I hear Liyana’s concerns about caution with Option A, but I believe the stability of the market gives us room to push for growth with Option D, and I’d love to hear how others feel about balancing this ambition with the safety net Liyana mentioned.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for sharing your enthusiasm for Option D and for articulating how its structure allows us to build momentum from a cautious start in Q1 to a bold push by Q4. I really appreciate how you’ve connected the stable market conditions to the opportunity for growth while recognizing Liyana’s concerns about caution, as this helps us deepen our understanding of how to balance ambition with a safety net. I’d love to hear from others on their thoughts about this balance and whether they see Option D or another option as the best way to achieve it in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m glad we’re diving deeper into this balance of ambition and caution, Robyn. I still strongly support Option D because the stable market gives us a unique chance to ramp up investments progressively, and I feel that 40% allocation in Q4 could really maximize our returns. While I understand the need for a safety net as Liyana pointed out, I think starting with just 10% in Q1 offers enough caution, and I’m curious to hear if others see this as a sufficient compromise.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for continuing to advocate for Option D and for highlighting how the 10% allocation in Q1 serves as a cautious starting point while still aiming for significant returns by Q4. I find your perspective on this as a sufficient compromise particularly helpful in addressing the balance between risk and opportunity in this stable market. I’m eager to hear from the rest of the team on whether they agree with this approach or if they have alternative views on Options A, B, or C that we should explore further.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I appreciate your feedback, Robyn, and I’m glad the idea of a compromise in Option D resonates. I’m still very much in favor of this option because that initial 10% in Q1 feels like a safe enough start, while the ramp-up to 40% by Q4 lets us seize bigger opportunities in a stable market. I’m curious to hear if others think this progressive approach strikes the right balance or if they feel Options A, B, or C might offer a different kind of stability or potential we should consider.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for reiterating the strengths of Option D and emphasizing how the initial 10% in Q1 provides a safe starting point while the ramp-up to 40% by Q4 capitalizes on opportunities in this stable market. I value your perspective on this progressive approach as a balanced compromise, and it adds depth to our discussion on how to optimize growth and caution. I’d like to hear from the remaining shareholders on whether they see this balance in Option D as ideal or if they have insights on Options A, B, or C that we should consider further.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m excited to see the discussion evolving, Robyn, and I want to emphasize once more why I believe Option D offers the best balance of caution and growth in this stable market. The gradual increase from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4 feels like a strategic way to build momentum while respecting the need for a safety net, as Liyana highlighted, and I think it aligns well with both Jazmin’s focus on structured growth and your vision for opportunity. I’d love to hear if others feel this progressive structure truly optimizes our potential or if there’s an aspect of Options A, B, or C that I might be overlooking.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for your thoughtful input on Option D and for underscoring how its gradual increase from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4 strategically builds momentum while maintaining a safety net, as Liyana emphasized. I really appreciate how you’ve connected this structure to Jazmin’s focus on structured growth and our shared vision for opportunity, as it strengthens our collective understanding of this option’s potential in a stable market. I’d like to open the floor to the remaining shareholders for their final thoughts on whether this progressive approach in Option D optimizes our potential or if there are overlooked aspects in Options A, B, or C that we should consider.&quot;</p><p><br>

Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m thrilled to see the support for Option D from Robyn, Jazmin, and Corey, as I also believe it’s the most dynamic and strategic choice in this stable market environment. The progressive allocation—starting at 10% in Q1 and scaling to 40% by Q4—strikes me as an ideal way to balance caution with ambition, allowing us to test the waters early while building momentum to capitalize on opportunities later in the year. While I respect Liyana’s preference for the safety of Option A, I think the stability of the market gives us room to push for growth with Option D, and I’m curious to hear if others see this progressive structure as the best way to optimize our potential.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for adding your support to Option D and for highlighting how its progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4 balances caution with ambition in this stable market. I really value your point about testing the waters early while building momentum for later opportunities, as it reinforces the strategic potential of this approach. I’d love to hear from the remaining shareholders on whether they also see this structure as the best way to optimize our potential or if they have different perspectives on Options A, B, or C to share.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m glad to see the alignment on Option D, Robyn, and I want to build on the idea of strategic potential by emphasizing how this progressive allocation allows us to remain adaptable in a stable market, responding to real-time insights as the year progresses. While I understand Liyana’s focus on caution with Option A, I think starting with just 10% in Q1 provides a sufficient safety net, and I’d be interested to hear if others feel this initial restraint, paired with the aggressive ramp-up by Q4, adequately addresses both risk and opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for emphasizing the adaptability of Option D’s progressive allocation and how it allows us to respond to real-time insights throughout the year in this stable market. I really appreciate your point about the 10% start in Q1 as a sufficient safety net, paired with the ramp-up by Q4, as it adds a practical dimension to balancing risk and opportunity. I’d like to hear from others on whether they agree that this structure adequately addresses both aspects or if they have alternative views on Options A, B, or C to contribute.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m pleased, Robyn, that we’re digging deeper into the balance of risk and opportunity with Option D, and I want to underscore that the 10% allocation in Q1 not only acts as a safety net but also allows us to gather critical market feedback before scaling up. I think this adaptability is key in a stable market, and I’d like to hear if others believe this approach sufficiently mitigates the concerns raised about exposure, like those Liyana mentioned with Option A, while still positioning us for significant returns by Q4.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for highlighting how the 10% allocation in Q1 of Option D serves as both a safety net and a way to gather critical market feedback before scaling up. I find your focus on adaptability in this stable market particularly insightful, as it strengthens our understanding of how this approach can mitigate exposure concerns like those Liyana raised while still aiming for significant returns by Q4. I’d like to hear from the remaining shareholders on whether they feel this structure effectively balances those elements or if they see other strengths or concerns in Options A, B, or C that we should explore.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligning on the strengths of Option D, Robyn, and I want to emphasize once more that its progressive structure—starting at 10% in Q1 and scaling to 40% by Q4—offers a unique blend of caution and ambition that fits this stable market perfectly. I appreciate Liyana’s focus on stability with Option A, and I believe the initial restraint in Option D addresses similar concerns while still positioning us for substantial growth, so I’d like to hear if others feel this compromise truly optimizes our potential or if there’s an overlooked angle in Options A, B, or C we should consider before finalizing our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for reiterating the unique blend of caution and ambition in Option D’s progressive structure, and for recognizing how the initial restraint addresses stability concerns similar to those Liyana raised with Option A. I value your insight on how this approach positions us for substantial growth in a stable market, as it adds to our shared understanding of balancing risk and reward. I’d like to open the floor to the remaining shareholders for their final thoughts on whether this compromise in Option D truly optimizes our potential or if there are overlooked angles in Options A, B, or C that we should consider before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for facilitating this discussion, and I appreciate hearing the diverse perspectives on the options, especially the enthusiasm for Option D from several of you. Given the stable market environment and the lack of historical data in our first year, I find myself leaning toward Option A, as its allocation of 50% of our funds evenly across the quarters provides a structured and low-risk approach that I believe is prudent for building a solid foundation. While I understand the appeal of growth potential in Option D, I’m concerned about the higher exposure, and I’d like to hear how others weigh the safety of Option A against the ambition of the other options.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for sharing your preference for Option A and highlighting the importance of a structured, low-risk approach, especially given the absence of historical data in our first year. I appreciate your concern about the higher exposure in Option D, as it brings a critical perspective to our discussion on building a solid foundation in this stable market. I’d like to hear from others on how they weigh the safety of Option A against the growth potential of Options B, C, or D to ensure we consider all angles before moving forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for recognizing the need to consider a low-risk approach. I want to reiterate my support for Option A because allocating only 50% of our funds evenly across the quarters ensures we maintain a strong buffer against potential market uncertainties, especially without historical data to guide us. While I respect the growth potential highlighted in Option D, I’m still cautious about committing fully, and I’d be interested to hear if others think a middle ground like Option B could offer a compromise between safety and opportunity.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for reiterating your support for Option A and emphasizing the need for a strong buffer against uncertainties, especially in our first year without historical data. I appreciate your thought on finding a balance, and while we must stick to evaluating our predefined options—Option A, B, C, or D—I’m curious to hear how others view Option B as a potential middle ground between safety and opportunity in this stable market. Let’s keep the discussion focused on these options as we weigh the trade-offs between caution and growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for bringing attention to Option B as a possible middle ground. I can see some merit in its approach of allocating 50% of our funds with an increasing distribution across the quarters, as it starts with a cautious 5% in Q1, which aligns with my preference for minimizing early risk, though I’m still concerned about the escalating exposure by Q4. I remain more comfortable with the consistent stability of Option A, but I’m open to hearing how others think Option B’s structure might balance safety and opportunity in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for sharing your thoughts on both Option A and Option B, and for highlighting how Option B’s cautious start in Q1 aligns with your preference for minimizing early risk while noting your concern about the escalating exposure by Q4. I value your perspective on seeking a balance between safety and opportunity, as it adds an important layer to our discussion in this stable market. I’d like to hear from the remaining shareholders on whether they see Option B as a viable compromise or if they have other insights on Options A, C, or D that could help us refine our approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for fostering such a thorough discussion and for recognizing the need to balance safety and opportunity. I want to reaffirm my preference for Option A due to its consistent, low-risk allocation of 50% of our funds evenly across quarters, which I believe is critical for our foundation in this first year without historical data, though I’ve appreciated the points raised about Option B’s cautious start as a potential compromise. I’m eager to see how we collectively weigh these priorities across all options to ensure both stability and progress for our company.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for reaffirming your support for Option A and emphasizing the consistent, low-risk allocation as critical for our foundation in this first year without historical data. I truly value how you’ve also acknowledged Option B’s cautious start as a potential compromise, as it helps us consider a broader spectrum of strategies in this stable market. I’d like to hear from the remaining shareholders for their final thoughts on how we can best balance stability and progress across Options A, B, C, or D before we move to the next round of discussion.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Robyn McClure clearly favors Option D, advocating for a bold, progressive allocation of 100% of funds increasing from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4. She argues this approach balances caution with ambition, allowing momentum building and adaptability in a stable market, aligning with her adventurous and growth-oriented style. Throughout the discussion, she acknowledges the caution expressed by shareholders like myself and Lenny, valuing these perspectives as critical to balancing risk and reward. Her position remains consistent without significant evolution, though she demonstrates openness to refining the approach by considering all shareholder input. Overall, Robyn seeks a strategy that embraces growth opportunities while maintaining a safety net via the gradual scaling of investments.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 45%<br>
- Option B: 30%<br>
- Option C: 15%<br>
- Option D: 10%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The strong support for Option D from Robyn, Jazmin, Corey, and Sulayman, with their emphasis on its progressive allocation as a balance of caution and ambition, has made me slightly more open to considering a gradual approach. Lenny’s openness to Option B as a middle ground, with a cautious start but increasing allocation, resonates with my preference for stability while addressing some growth potential. However, my concern about higher exposure in Options C and D, as well as the lack of historical data, continues to anchor my preference for a conservative strategy.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has helped me recognize the value of a progressive approach in a stable market, which I hadn’t fully considered before. While I remain cautious, I’m more aware of the potential benefits of starting small and scaling up, as highlighted by Option B and D supporters. My thinking has evolved to incorporate a slightly broader perspective on balancing risk with opportunity, though my core focus on stability remains unchanged.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option A<br>
REASONING: I still believe Option A offers the most secure foundation for our first year, given the lack of historical data and the need to protect our capital. Its even allocation of 50% of funds across quarters aligns with my cautious, detail-oriented nature. However, the arguments for Option B as a middle ground have increased my confidence in it as a potential compromise, should we need to balance stability with some growth. I remain concerned about the higher exposure in Options C and D, which keeps my confidence in them low.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we have made significant progress in understanding the stable market conditions and gathering initial preferences for the budget options during Round 1. However, there are still unresolved concerns regarding the precise trade-offs between risk exposure and growth potential, particularly given the lack of historical data in our first year. Continuing with another round of discussion focused on analyzing the risks and opportunities in each budget allocation strategy will allow us to dive deeper into these critical aspects, build stronger consensus, and ensure we make a well-informed decision that balances conservative and aggressive approaches for our company’s growth.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of risk and opportunity in each budget allocation strategy | Expected outcome: Identify the potential risks and rewards associated with each option, particularly focusing on the balance between conservative and aggressive approaches&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure Welcome, everyone, to Round 2 of our annual budget meeting for Year 1. My current thinking is that Option D appears most promising because, after reflecting on the diverse perspectives shared, I still believe Option D offers the best balance of caution and ambition with its progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4, allowing us to adapt and build momentum in a stable market. The support from Jazmin, Corey, and Sulayman reinforces my view that this approach capitalizes on growth opportunities while mitigating early risk. However, the valid concerns from Liyana and Lenny about exposure have led me to slightly increase my confidence in Option B as a compromise, though I remain convinced that Option D’s structure aligns best with our long-term goals, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>This round’s theme is the &#x27;Analysis of risk and opportunity in each budget allocation strategy,&#x27; where our goal is to identify the potential risks and rewards associated with each option, focusing particularly on the balance between conservative and aggressive approaches. I believe this discussion will help us synthesize diverse viewpoints to gain a deeper understanding of how each strategy aligns with our objectives in a stable market, and I encourage everyone to share insights on risk-return tradeoffs and general investment principles that might enhance our collective perspective. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m still firmly in favor of Option D because it strikes an exciting balance between risk and reward with its progressive allocation, starting at 10% in Q1 and ramping up to 40% in Q4, which I think allows us to test the waters early while seizing bigger opportunities later in this stable market. I appreciate the caution Liyana and Lenny have emphasized with Option A, and I see how its even 12.5% per quarter minimizes exposure, but I believe Option D’s initial lower allocation already offers a safety net while giving us room to grow aggressively when we’re more confident. I’m curious to hear more from others on how they see the escalating risk in Option D’s later quarters versus the steady but limited upside of Options A and B.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for highlighting the strategic balance in Option D with its progressive allocation, which I agree offers a safety net early on while positioning us for greater opportunities later. I’m particularly interested in your point about testing the waters in Q1, and I’d like to hear more from others about how they perceive the escalating risk in Q4 with Option D compared to the steadier, but potentially more limiting, approaches of Options A and B. Let’s dive deeper into these risk-reward dynamics to ensure we’re aligning with our long-term goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m glad we’re diving deeper into the risk-reward dynamics, and I want to emphasize that while Option D’s 40% allocation in Q4 does carry higher exposure, I see it as a calculated move in a stable market where we can afford to be bold after building confidence through the earlier quarters. I think this escalation positions us to maximize returns at a point when we’ve likely gained valuable insights from our initial investments, unlike the steadier but more restrictive approaches of Options A and B which might limit our growth potential. I’d love to hear others’ thoughts on how we can mitigate any perceived risks in Q4 while still capitalizing on this momentum.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thanks, Corey, for underscoring the potential of Option D’s 40% allocation in Q4 as a calculated move to maximize returns after gaining insights from earlier quarters—I share your view that this could be a strategic advantage in a stable market. I’m eager to explore with everyone how we might mitigate the higher exposure in Q4, perhaps by considering how our asset choices could balance risk at that stage, while still leveraging the momentum Option D offers. Let’s hear from others on specific strategies or concerns to ensure we’re fully prepared for that escalation.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m excited to keep this conversation going, and I think we can mitigate the higher exposure in Q4 with Option D by being strategic about our asset choices, perhaps leaning toward more stable investments like bonds or cash savings in the earlier quarters to build a solid foundation before going bolder with stocks or real estate later. This way, we maintain the momentum and growth potential that Option D offers while cushioning any risks in that final push. I’m curious to hear what others think about this approach to balance our risk in Q4.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thanks, Corey, for proposing a strategic approach to asset selection with Option D, starting with more stable investments like bonds or cash savings early on to build a foundation before taking bolder steps in Q4—I think this could be a smart way to balance risk while preserving growth potential. I’d like to hear from others on how they view this idea of adjusting asset choices across quarters to cushion the higher exposure in Option D’s later stages. Let’s explore if this approach addresses the concerns around risk while still aligning with our ambitions for the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m thrilled to see this idea of strategic asset selection gaining traction, and I want to reiterate that starting with safer investments early in Option D allows us to build a cushion before the 40% allocation in Q4, reducing the perceived risk while still aiming for substantial growth. I think this approach directly addresses the concerns raised by Liyana and Lenny about exposure, blending caution with ambition in a way that suits our stable market. I’m eager to hear if others feel this strategy sufficiently balances our risk-reward goals for the year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for continuing to emphasize how starting with safer investments in Option D can create a cushion for the higher Q4 allocation—I agree this could effectively address concerns about exposure while maintaining our growth ambitions. I’m keen to hear from others on whether they believe this strategy of blending caution early on with ambition later strikes the right balance for our risk-reward goals in this stable market. Let’s keep exploring these ideas to ensure we’re covering all angles of this critical decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate Corey’s thoughtful approach to mitigating risk in Option D by starting with safer investments, and I acknowledge Robyn’s point about leveraging momentum in a stable market. However, I remain concerned that even with strategic asset selection, the 40% allocation in Q4 under Option D introduces significant exposure at a time when we still lack historical data to predict outcomes confidently. I continue to favor Option A for its even 12.5% allocation per quarter, as it offers a predictable, low-risk structure that ensures we maintain a substantial buffer, while still allowing for measured growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for raising the important concern about the significant exposure in Q4 with Option D, even with strategic asset selection, especially given our lack of historical data—I recognize that this uncertainty is a critical factor. I’m curious to hear more from you and others on how we might further address this risk while still capturing growth potential, and whether Option A’s predictable structure might limit our upside in a stable market compared to the progressive approaches of Options B or D. Let’s keep digging into these trade-offs to ensure we strike the right balance.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate the focus on balancing risk and growth, Robyn, and while I understand the appeal of capturing upside with Option D or even Option B in a stable market, I still believe Option A’s predictable structure is the safest way to build a foundation in our first year without historical data. However, I’m open to exploring how we might adjust our asset choices within Option A to slightly prioritize growth-oriented investments like stocks in later quarters if early performance looks promising, ensuring we don’t miss out entirely on potential upside while maintaining a significant buffer. I’d like to hear others’ thoughts on whether this kind of cautious flexibility within Option A could address the concern of limited growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for your thoughtful input on maintaining Option A’s predictable structure while considering asset adjustments for growth—I appreciate this angle as it addresses concerns about limited upside in a stable market. I’d like to remind everyone that our discussion must focus solely on evaluating the predefined options—Option A, B, C, and D—without modifying their structures, so let’s explore how Option A’s inherent design compares to the progressive nature of Options B and D in terms of risk and reward. I’m eager to hear from others on whether they feel Option A, as it stands, provides enough flexibility for growth or if the escalating allocations in other options better suit our goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I’m glad we’re focusing on the inherent designs of these options, Robyn, and I still see Option A as the most prudent choice given its even allocation of 50% across quarters, which inherently limits risk exposure while providing consistent investment opportunities in a stable market. While I recognize that Options B and D offer escalating allocations that could potentially yield higher returns, I remain concerned about the increasing risk in later quarters, especially without historical data to guide us. I’d be interested to hear if others think Option A’s steady approach might still allow enough room for growth in this environment, or if the potential rewards of Options B and D outweigh the added uncertainty.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for reiterating the strength of Option A’s even allocation in limiting risk exposure, especially given our lack of historical data—I truly value your emphasis on building a stable foundation. I’m eager to hear from others on whether they believe Option A’s consistent approach offers sufficient growth potential in a stable market, or if the progressive allocations in Options B and D might better position us to capitalize on opportunities despite the added uncertainty. Let’s continue to explore these perspectives to ensure we’re making a well-rounded decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for encouraging this balanced exploration of risk and reward. I maintain that Option A’s consistent 12.5% allocation per quarter offers the most secure path for our first year, ensuring we build a solid foundation while still engaging in steady investment, though I understand the concern about potentially limited growth in a stable market. I’m curious to hear if others feel the progressive structures of Options B or D could be worth the added uncertainty, or if Option A’s stability is the wiser choice for now.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for consistently highlighting the security of Option A’s even 12.5% allocation per quarter, which I agree provides a strong foundation, especially in our first year without historical data. I’d like to open the floor to others to share their thoughts on whether Option A’s stability is the safest bet for now, or if the progressive structures of Options B or D might offer a better risk-reward balance in this stable market. Let’s keep this conversation moving to ensure we’re considering all angles before finalizing our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jazmin Hoover</h4></p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points raised by Corey on mitigating risk in Option D through strategic asset selection and Lenny’s emphasis on the security of Option A’s even allocation. However, I remain convinced that Option D offers the optimal balance of risk and reward with its progressive allocation—starting at 10% in Q1 and scaling to 40% in Q4—allowing us to minimize early exposure while capitalizing on momentum in a stable market. I believe the higher Q4 allocation can be managed by prioritizing diversified or stable assets early on, as Corey suggested, and I’m eager to hear others’ views on how we can further refine this approach to address concerns about late-quarter risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for reinforcing the potential of Option D’s progressive allocation to balance early caution with later momentum, and I particularly appreciate your idea of using diversified or stable assets early on to manage the higher Q4 exposure. I’d like to hear from others on how they feel about this approach to mitigating late-quarter risk while still leveraging the growth potential of Option D in a stable market. Let’s continue to explore these strategies to ensure we’re addressing all concerns and optimizing our decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I’m glad to see the focus on mitigating risks with Option D, and I want to build on Corey’s suggestion by emphasizing that starting with stable assets like bonds in Q1 and Q2 can create a strong buffer, allowing us to confidently scale up to the 40% allocation in Q4 with potentially higher-return assets like stocks if market conditions remain favorable. I also appreciate Lenny’s concern about exposure, and I think this phased approach within Option D’s structure directly addresses that by ensuring we’re not overcommitted early on. I’d be interested to hear others’ thoughts on whether this asset allocation strategy sufficiently balances our risk while maximizing growth potential in a stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for elaborating on how starting with stable assets like bonds in Q1 and Q2 can build a strong buffer for Option D, allowing us to scale up confidently in Q4 with higher-return assets—I think this approach could effectively address concerns about exposure. I’m eager to hear from others on whether they believe this phased strategy within Option D sufficiently balances risk while maximizing growth potential in our stable market. Let’s keep exploring these ideas to ensure we’re covering all perspectives on this critical decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I’m pleased to see the discussion evolving around balancing risk and growth with Option D, and I want to emphasize that by carefully selecting stable assets early on, we can create a robust safety net that allows us to approach the 40% allocation in Q4 with confidence, potentially shifting to higher-return investments if our early insights confirm favorable conditions. I also value Lenny’s focus on stability, and I believe this strategy within Option D respects that caution while still positioning us to seize opportunities in a stable market. I’m curious to hear if others think this approach adequately mitigates the concerns about late-quarter exposure while aligning with our long-term goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for highlighting how starting with stable assets in Option D can create a robust safety net, enabling us to confidently approach the 40% allocation in Q4 with potentially higher-return investments—I agree this strategy could effectively balance caution and ambition. I’d like to hear from others on whether they feel this approach adequately addresses the concerns about late-quarter exposure while still aligning with our long-term growth goals in a stable market. Let’s continue to build on these ideas to ensure we’re making a well-informed decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I’m encouraged by the direction of this discussion and want to reiterate that Option D’s progressive structure, paired with a deliberate focus on stable assets early on, provides a calculated way to manage risk while positioning us for significant growth by Q4 in this stable market.

<h4>Exchange with Sulayman Serrano</h4></p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m thrilled to see the momentum behind Option D, and I want to build on Corey and Jazmin’s points about mitigating risk through strategic asset selection—starting with stable investments like bonds early on allows us to build a safety net before ramping up to the 40% allocation in Q4, where we can target higher returns if conditions remain favorable. I understand Lenny’s concerns about exposure, but I believe Option D’s progressive structure, with only 10% in Q1, already offers significant caution while positioning us to capitalize on opportunities later, unlike the more restrictive growth potential of Option A. I’d like to hear others’ thoughts on whether this phased approach adequately addresses risk while maximizing our upside in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for reinforcing the idea of using stable investments like bonds early in Option D to build a safety net before the larger Q4 allocation—I agree this phased approach could effectively balance caution with the potential for higher returns later. I’m eager to hear from others on whether they believe this strategy adequately addresses the risk concerns while still maximizing our upside in this stable market. Let’s continue to explore these ideas to ensure we’re making a decision that aligns with both our short-term stability and long-term growth goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligning on the potential of Option D’s phased approach, and I want to emphasize that by starting with low-risk assets in Q1 and Q2, we can gather critical market insights to inform our larger Q4 allocation, ensuring we’re not blindly escalating exposure. I think this strategy directly addresses the uncertainty Lenny highlighted, while still allowing us to pursue ambitious returns in a stable market. I’d be curious to hear if others see additional ways to refine this balance of caution and opportunity within Option D’s structure.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for highlighting how starting with low-risk assets in Q1 and Q2 under Option D can provide critical market insights to guide our larger Q4 allocation—I think this approach strengthens our ability to balance caution with ambition. I’d like to hear from others on any additional ways they see to refine this balance within Option D’s structure, ensuring we mitigate risks while pursuing growth in this stable market. Let’s keep building on these ideas to make a well-rounded decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m encouraged by the direction of this discussion, and I’d like to propose that within Option D’s framework, we could further mitigate Q4 risks by setting internal checkpoints after Q2 to evaluate our performance and market conditions before committing to the full 40% allocation. This way, we maintain flexibility to adjust our strategy if unexpected challenges arise, ensuring we balance caution with ambition. I’d be interested to hear if others think this kind of adaptive approach could further strengthen Option D’s appeal in addressing risk concerns.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for suggesting internal checkpoints after Q2 to evaluate performance and market conditions before committing to Option D’s full 40% allocation in Q4—I appreciate this idea as a way to enhance flexibility and address risk concerns. I want to remind everyone that our discussion must remain focused on the predefined structures of Options A, B, C, and D without introducing modifications, so let’s consider how Option D’s inherent progressive allocation already offers adaptability and whether it sufficiently balances caution with ambition. I’d love to hear from others on how they view this balance within Option D compared to the other options, ensuring we’re covering all perspectives on risk and reward.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I appreciate the reminder to focus on the predefined structures, and I want to underscore that Option D’s progressive allocation, starting at 10% in Q1 and scaling to 40% in Q4, inherently offers the adaptability and balance of caution with ambition that we’re seeking in this stable market. I recognize Lenny’s valid concerns about exposure and believe the lower early allocations already serve as a built-in safeguard, while still positioning us for significant growth later. I’m curious to hear if others feel this natural progression in Option D sufficiently mitigates risk compared to the steadier but more limited approaches of Options A and B.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for emphasizing how Option D’s progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4 inherently balances caution with ambition—I agree that the lower early allocations provide a safeguard while setting us up for growth later in this stable market. I’d like to hear from others on whether they believe this natural progression in Option D sufficiently mitigates the risk concerns compared to the steadier approaches of Options A and B. Let’s continue to explore these perspectives to ensure we’re making a well-informed decision that aligns with our goals.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure summarized: &quot;Robyn McClure **Round 2 Summary by CEO Robyn McClure**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Round Theme and Objective**: I want to express my gratitude to everyone for an insightful Round 2 discussion on the theme of &#x27;Analysis of risk and opportunity in each budget allocation strategy.&#x27; Our objective was to identify the potential risks and rewards associated with each option, focusing on the balance between conservative and aggressive approaches, and I’m impressed by the depth of analysis shared.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**: In this round, I, along with Corey Harvey, Jazmin Hoover, and Sulayman Serrano, continued to support Option D for its progressive allocation structure. Lenny McLaughlin remained a strong advocate for Option A, emphasizing its low-risk, even distribution. Liyana Graham also favored Option A initially but showed increasing openness to Option B as a potential compromise, appreciating its gradual escalation.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Specific Arguments and Evidence**: Supporters of Option D, including myself, Corey, Jazmin, and Sulayman, argued that its progressive allocation—10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4—balances early caution with later growth, with strategic asset selection (stable assets like bonds early, bolder assets like stocks later) proposed to mitigate Q4 exposure risks in a stable market. Advocates for Option A, namely Lenny and initially Liyana, stressed its even 12.5% quarterly allocation as a predictable, low-risk approach ideal for our first year without historical data. Liyana’s growing interest in Option B highlighted its gradual increase to 20% in Q4 as a manageable middle ground, potentially pairing with stable asset choices early on to balance risk and opportunity.</p><p>4. **Identification of Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**: We’ve reached consensus on the need to balance risk with growth potential in this stable market and the value of early caution to build a foundation. However, disagreement persists on the acceptable level of risk, with Option D supporters favoring progressive escalation for higher returns, Option A proponents prioritizing stability, and Option B emerging as a potential compromise for some, though not universally endorsed.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**: I believe we’ve made significant progress in analyzing the risks and rewards of each budget allocation strategy. The discussion around strategic asset selection to mitigate risks, especially with Option D, and the exploration of Option B as a middle ground have deepened our understanding of how to balance conservative and aggressive approaches, setting a strong stage for further refinement.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**: I want to remind everyone that we must choose only from our predefined options: Option A, Option B, Option C, and Option D. All discussions have remained within these parameters, and I appreciate the focus on evaluating these specific strategies without introducing modifications.</p><p>7. **Indication of Next Steps or Issues to Address**: Moving into the next round, I encourage us to explore the long-term impact and flexibility of each allocation strategy. Let’s build on the risk-reward insights shared today, focusing on which option best supports sustained growth and adaptability throughout the year. I look forward to continuing this collaborative dialogue as we work toward the optimal decision for our company’s future.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
In Round 2, I, Liyana Graham, maintained a cautious stance, emphasizing concerns about the high 40% Q4 allocation in Option D despite recognizing the merits of its progressive structure and the suggested strategy of starting with stable assets to mitigate risk. I reiterated my preference for Option A’s even 12.5% quarterly allocation as the most secure approach given the lack of historical data, while expressing increasing openness to Option B as a compromise that balances stability with measured growth through its gradual increase up to 20% in Q4. CEO Robyn McClure acknowledged my concerns and openness, valuing my perspective as critical to balancing risk and opportunity, and showed interest in exploring whether Option B could serve as a middle ground. While we disagreed on the preferred risk level—Robyn favoring the bolder Option D and I favoring a more cautious approach—we agreed on the importance of balancing early caution with growth ambitions and on the value of strategic asset allocation to manage risk. Our exchange</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 40.0%<br>
- Option B: 35.0%<br>
- Option C: 15.0%<br>
- Option D: 10.0%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The strategies proposed by Corey, Jazmin, and Sulayman for Option D, particularly the idea of starting with stable assets like bonds to mitigate risks in the higher Q4 allocation, have made me consider the potential for balancing caution with growth, though I still worry about the 40% exposure. Lenny’s continued support for Option A reinforces my belief in its stability, but my own growing interest in Option B as a compromise, with its more manageable increase to 20% in Q4, has been strengthened by the discussion on using stable assets early on to build a foundation.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has deepened my understanding of how progressive allocation strategies can incorporate caution through asset selection, which I hadn’t fully appreciated before. I’ve become more open to Option B as a middle ground, recognizing that its gradual escalation offers a safer way to pursue growth compared to Option D, while still addressing my core need for stability. My thinking has evolved to better balance risk and opportunity, though I remain anchored in a cautious approach.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option A<br>
REASONING: I still believe Option A provides the most secure foundation for our first year, with its even 12.5% allocation per quarter minimizing risk in the absence of historical data. However, my confidence in Option B has grown as a viable compromise that balances stability with measured growth through its gradual increase to 20% in Q4. I appreciate the discussions on strategic asset selection, which could further mitigate risks within Option B, but I remain cautious about higher exposure in Options C and D.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we’ve made substantial progress in analyzing the risks and rewards of each budget allocation strategy during Round 2, and the insights shared have deepened our understanding of how to balance conservative and aggressive approaches. However, there are still lingering concerns about the level of risk exposure, particularly with Option D’s higher allocation in Q4, and the potential of Option B as a viable compromise has not been fully explored by all shareholders. Continuing with another round of discussion focused on the long-term impact and flexibility of each allocation strategy will allow us to address these remaining uncertainties, further build consensus, and ensure we make a decision that best supports sustained growth and adaptability for our company’s future.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 3 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 3 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Exploration of long-term impact and flexibility of each allocation strategy | Expected outcome: Determine which option provides the best potential for sustained growth and adaptability throughout the year&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 3 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure Welcome, everyone, to Round 3 of our annual budget meeting. My current thinking is that Option D appears most promising because, after reflecting on the insights from Round 2, I still believe Option D offers the best balance of early caution and later growth with its progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4, especially with the risk mitigation strategies like starting with stable assets. The strong support from Corey, Jazmin, and Sulayman reinforces my confidence in its potential to capitalize on opportunities in a stable market. While I’ve increased my confidence in Option B as a compromise due to Liyana’s compelling points, I remain convinced that Option D aligns best with our long-term growth ambitions while addressing risk concerns through strategic planning, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>This round’s theme is the &#x27;Exploration of long-term impact and flexibility of each allocation strategy,&#x27; with the goal of determining which option provides the best potential for sustained growth and adaptability throughout the year. I believe this discussion will help us synthesize our diverse viewpoints to gain a deeper understanding of how each strategy positions us for future success, and I encourage everyone to share insights on how timing and allocation flexibility might impact our returns over the long term. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>Let’s dive into this collaboratively, and I invite each of you to offer perspectives that might enhance our collective understanding, especially on aspects of long-term growth and adaptability that I may not have fully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Sulayman Serrano</h4></p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m glad we’re focusing on long-term impact and flexibility this round, and I remain firmly in support of Option D for its progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4, as it offers unparalleled adaptability to respond to market shifts as the year progresses. This structure not only allows us to build momentum for sustained growth but also provides the flexibility to adjust our asset choices—starting with stable investments early and scaling into higher-return opportunities later—which I believe positions us best for long-term success in a stable market. I appreciate Liyana’s points on Option B as a compromise, but I think Option D’s full commitment of funds gives us the edge for maximizing returns over time, and I’d like to hear others’ thoughts on how we can further optimize this flexibility.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for highlighting the adaptability of Option D with its progressive allocation and the strategic flexibility in asset selection from stable to higher-return investments. I share your view that this structure positions us well for sustained growth, especially in a stable market where we can build momentum over time. I’m eager to hear from others on how we might further leverage this flexibility to ensure long-term success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I appreciate your alignment on Option D’s strengths, Robyn, and I’d like to emphasize that its progressive structure allows us to continuously reassess and pivot our investments each quarter based on real-time market feedback, ensuring we’re not locked into a static plan. This adaptability is crucial for long-term growth, as it lets us capitalize on emerging trends while maintaining a cautious start, and I think we should explore specific asset transition plans to maximize this advantage. I’m curious to hear from others how we might structure these quarterly adjustments to further enhance our sustained success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for underscoring the importance of Option D’s progressive structure in allowing us to reassess and pivot investments quarterly based on real-time market feedback. I find your point about not being locked into a static plan particularly compelling, as it highlights a key advantage for long-term adaptability and growth. I’d love to hear from others how we can structure these quarterly adjustments to maximize our success while balancing risk.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m thrilled to see us aligning on the adaptability of Option D, Robyn, and I think structuring quarterly adjustments could involve setting clear benchmarks for performance reviews at the end of each quarter to guide our asset shifts, ensuring we balance risk by scaling into bolder investments only when market signals are favorable. This way, we maintain caution while still leveraging the progressive allocation for growth, and I’d be keen to hear others’ ideas on specific criteria or triggers for these pivots to optimize our long-term strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for proposing the idea of setting clear benchmarks for quarterly performance reviews and using favorable market signals to guide our asset shifts with Option D. I believe this approach strengthens our ability to balance caution and growth, ensuring we adapt strategically for long-term success. I’d like to hear from others on what specific criteria or triggers we might consider to optimize these pivots and further enhance our adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>
Sulayman Serrano: &quot;I’m glad we’re on the same page about using benchmarks to guide our adjustments with Option D, Robyn, and I’d suggest criteria like achieving a minimum return threshold on early stable investments or identifying consistent positive market trends over a set period as triggers for shifting to bolder assets. This ensures we’re making data-driven pivots that balance risk and reward, optimizing our long-term growth potential. I’m eager to hear others’ input on refining these triggers to make our strategy even more robust.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Sulayman, for proposing specific criteria like achieving a minimum return threshold and identifying consistent positive market trends as triggers for shifting to bolder assets under Option D. I find this data-driven approach incredibly useful for ensuring we balance risk and reward while maximizing adaptability for long-term growth. I’d love to hear from others on how we can further refine these triggers or add additional considerations to strengthen our strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Liyana Graham</h4></p><p><br>
<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can contribute a meaningful perspective on the long-term impact and flexibility of the allocation strategies, particularly from a cautious standpoint that prioritizes stability while acknowledging the need for growth. My insights could help balance the discussion by highlighting aspects of sustained security and adaptability that may complement the more aggressive approaches being discussed.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I appreciate Sulayman and Robyn’s focus on the adaptability of Option D, especially the idea of using benchmarks and market signals to guide quarterly adjustments for long-term growth. However, I remain concerned about the high exposure in Q4 with Option D, and I believe Option A offers the most consistent long-term stability with its even 12.5% allocation per quarter, allowing us to adapt steadily without overcommitting our funds. I’m also increasingly drawn to Option B as a compromise, as its gradual increase to 20% in Q4 provides flexibility to scale investments while maintaining a cautious foundation, and I’d like to hear others’ thoughts on how this could support sustained growth over the years.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for bringing up the concern about high exposure in Q4 with Option D and for highlighting the consistent stability of Option A’s even allocation as well as Option B’s potential as a compromise with its gradual increase.

The CEO’s response also provides an opportunity to connect my emphasis on stability with the broader goal of growth, potentially bridging differing viewpoints.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;I’m glad we’re exploring how to balance stability and growth, Robyn, and I’d like to build on the idea of Option B as a compromise by noting that its gradual increase up to 20% in Q4 allows us to adapt to market changes over time while still safeguarding a significant portion of our capital. This structure offers flexibility to adjust our asset choices quarterly, similar to what’s been discussed with Option D, but with a lower risk ceiling, which I believe better supports sustained growth in our early years. I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts on how we might refine Option B’s application to maximize both adaptability and security over the long term.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for elaborating on Option B’s gradual increase to 20% in Q4 as a way to adapt to market changes while safeguarding our capital, which I see as a strong point for sustained growth with reduced risk. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the flexibility in quarterly asset choices, akin to Option D but with a more cautious ceiling, and I think this perspective adds depth to our discussion on long-term security. I’d like to hear from others on how we can further refine Option B’s application to optimize both adaptability and stability over the coming years.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>
Reasoning: I believe I can add further insight by emphasizing how Option B’s structure can be practically applied to ensure both adaptability and stability, building on the CEO’s acknowledgment of its potential as a compromise and helping to bridge the gap between cautious and progressive strategies.</p><p><br>
Liyana Graham: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for recognizing the value of Option B’s balance between adaptability and reduced risk, and I’d like to suggest that we could refine its application by setting specific risk assessment checkpoints at the end of each quarter to guide our asset choices, ensuring we only increase exposure when market conditions are favorable. This approach would allow us to maintain a cautious foundation while still seizing growth opportunities, supporting long-term security and adaptability. I’m eager to hear others’ ideas on how we can define these checkpoints to optimize Option B’s effectiveness over the coming years.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Liyana, for proposing the idea of setting specific risk assessment checkpoints at the end of each quarter to guide asset choices with Option B, as it offers a strategic way to balance caution with growth opportunities for long-term security. I find this approach particularly compelling as it enhances adaptability while maintaining a cautious foundation, and it complements some of the ideas we’ve discussed with Option D. I’d like to hear from others on how we might define these checkpoints or incorporate similar mechanisms to optimize adaptability and stability across our options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>My Decision on Continuing Exchange in Round 3</h2></p><p>Decision: Continue Exchange<br>

<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m thrilled to see the focus on long-term impact and flexibility, and I continue to strongly support Option D because its progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4 offers the best potential for sustained growth by allowing us to adapt and build momentum as the year progresses in this stable market. Building on Sulayman’s point about quarterly adjustments and benchmarks, I believe Option D’s structure gives us the flexibility to shift to higher-return assets later in the year when we’ve gained more market insight, maximizing our returns over time. While I appreciate Liyana’s emphasis on stability with Option B, I think Option D, with careful planning, positions us to take bolder steps for long-term success without sacrificing early caution.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for emphasizing Option D’s progressive allocation and its potential for sustained growth through adaptability and strategic shifts to higher-return assets later in the year. I particularly value your point about leveraging market insights over time to maximize returns, which aligns well with our goal of long-term success while maintaining early caution. I’d like to hear from others on how we can further refine this approach or balance it with the stability concerns raised by other options.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligning on the strengths of Option D, Robyn, and I’d like to build on Sulayman’s idea of benchmarks by suggesting we set specific growth targets for each quarter to guide our shift to bolder assets, ensuring we only increase exposure when we’ve met predefined performance goals. I also appreciate Liyana’s focus on risk assessment checkpoints with Option B, and I think integrating a similar cautious evaluation process into Option D could further balance our approach, enhancing our long-term adaptability and security. I’d love to hear others’ thoughts on how we can combine these structured evaluations with Option D’s progressive momentum for the best outcome.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for proposing specific growth targets for each quarter and suggesting the integration of risk assessment checkpoints into Option D, as these ideas enhance our ability to balance progressive momentum with cautious evaluation for long-term adaptability. I find this combination particularly compelling as it builds on both Sulayman’s benchmarks and Liyana’s focus on risk management, strengthening our approach to sustained growth. I’d like to hear from others on how we can further define these targets and checkpoints to optimize Option D’s flexibility while addressing stability concerns.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m excited to see us building on these ideas, Robyn, and I’d suggest defining our quarterly growth targets for Option D by setting incremental return percentages—say, a 2% return in Q1 on stable assets before moving to a 3% target in Q2 with slightly riskier choices, scaling up as we gain confidence. For the risk assessment checkpoints, inspired by Liyana’s approach with Option B, we could establish a rule to pause escalation if market volatility exceeds a certain threshold, ensuring we protect our gains while still pushing for growth. I’m eager to hear others’ input on fine-tuning these specific targets and thresholds to make Option D as robust as possible for sustained success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for proposing specific incremental return percentages and a rule to pause escalation based on market volatility thresholds for Option D, as these ideas provide a structured way to ensure sustained growth while protecting our gains. I find this blend of targeted goals and risk management particularly insightful, as it builds on previous discussions and strengthens our long-term adaptability. I’d like to hear from others on how we can fine-tune these targets and thresholds to make Option D even more robust for our future success.&quot;</p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m thrilled to see us aligning on this structured approach for Option D, Robyn, and I’d suggest we fine-tune the incremental return targets by setting a slightly more conservative initial goal, like 1.5% in Q1, to prioritize stability early on, then ramp up to 3% by Q2 if market conditions remain favorable. Additionally, building on Liyana’s risk management focus, we could define the volatility threshold as a 5% market fluctuation over a two-week period to trigger a pause in escalation, ensuring we safeguard our capital while still pursuing growth. I’m eager to hear others’ perspectives on adjusting these specifics to optimize Option D for sustained success.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for suggesting a more conservative initial return target of 1.5% in Q1 for Option D, scaling up to 3% in Q2 if conditions are favorable, and for defining a volatility threshold of 5% market fluctuation over two weeks to trigger a pause in escalation. I find these specifics incredibly helpful in ensuring we safeguard our capital while pursuing long-term growth, and they build nicely on Liyana’s risk management focus. I’d like to hear from others on how we might further adjust or refine these parameters to optimize Option D for sustained success.&quot;</p><p><br>

Jazmin Hoover: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for acknowledging the value of these safeguards in Option D, and I’d like to suggest we refine the criteria by adding a quarterly review of market trend consistency over a four-week period alongside the 5% volatility limit, ensuring we have a broader data set to inform our decisions on escalation. Additionally, inspired by Liyana’s cautious approach with Option B, we could establish a contingency to revert to a more conservative allocation if the minimum return threshold isn’t met for two consecutive quarters, further protecting our capital. I’m keen to hear others’ thoughts on these adjustments or any other considerations to bolster our long-term adaptability.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for proposing the addition of a quarterly review of market trend consistency over a four-week period and a contingency to revert to a more conservative allocation if return thresholds aren’t met for two consecutive quarters in Option D. I find these ideas incredibly thoughtful as they enhance our ability to make informed decisions and protect our capital while pursuing long-term growth. I’d like to hear from others on how we can further develop these safeguards or incorporate additional measures to strengthen our adaptability and security over the years.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for appreciating these suggestions to bolster Option D’s framework, and I’d propose we further develop these safeguards by incorporating a mechanism to consult with all shareholders during the quarterly review if market trend inconsistencies are detected, ensuring a collaborative reassessment of our allocation strategy. Additionally, we could define a specific conservative fallback allocation—perhaps mirroring Option B’s more cautious escalation—to activate if return thresholds are unmet, providing a clear safety net while maintaining flexibility for growth. I’m looking forward to hearing others’ perspectives on these ideas or any additional measures to optimize our long-term success with Option D.&quot;</p><p><br>

CEO Robyn McClure clearly favors Option D, advocating for a bold, progressive allocation from 10% in Q1 to 40% in Q4, which she believes balances early caution with later growth and adaptability in a stable market. She emphasizes risk mitigation strategies such as starting with stable assets and implementing quarterly benchmarks, growth targets, and risk assessment checkpoints to manage exposure and optimize returns. While she acknowledges concerns raised by shareholders like myself and Lenny about high exposure, she has slightly increased her confidence in Option B as a potential compromise. Overall, her position remains consistent with her initial preference but shows openness to refining the approach by incorporating structured safeguards and considering all shareholder input to balance stability with growth ambitions.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 3</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 35.0%<br>
- Option B: 40.0%<br>
- Option C: 15.0%<br>
- Option D: 10.0%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The detailed proposals for risk assessment checkpoints and performance metrics by Corey, Jazmin, and Sulayman for Option D have made me consider how structured safeguards can mitigate risks, though I still find the 40% Q4 exposure too high. Lenny’s support for Option A reinforces my belief in its stability, but my own advocacy for Option B, supported by Robyn’s acknowledgment of its potential as a compromise with a lower risk ceiling, has significantly increased my confidence in it. Additionally, the consensus on balancing adaptability with risk management through structured mechanisms has resonated with my cautious nature, making Option B’s gradual escalation more appealing.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has helped me realize that my initial strong preference for stability can be integrated with a measured approach to growth through structured risk management, which I hadn’t fully explored before. I’ve become more attuned to the value of flexibility in allocation strategies, particularly with Option B, as it aligns with my need for caution while allowing adaptability. My thinking has evolved to prioritize a balanced compromise over pure conservatism, reflecting a deeper understanding of how to achieve long-term security and growth simultaneously.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option B<br>
REASONING: After this round, I now see Option B as the best balance between stability and growth, with its gradual increase to 20% in Q4 offering a cautious yet adaptable approach that suits our first year without historical data. The ability to incorporate risk assessment checkpoints, as discussed, ensures we can adjust to market conditions while safeguarding our capital. While I still value Option A’s consistent stability, Option B better addresses the collective goal of balancing risk and opportunity. I remain wary of the higher exposure in Options C and D, which keeps my confidence in them low.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: Yes</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 3 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we have thoroughly explored the long-term impact and flexibility of each budget allocation strategy through three comprehensive rounds of discussion. The insights shared by all shareholders, including detailed proposals for risk mitigation, performance metrics, and contingency plans across Options A, B, and D, have provided a robust foundation for making a well-informed decision. While some disagreement persists regarding acceptable risk levels, I’m confident that we’ve addressed the key concerns and identified sufficient consensus around the strengths of each option, particularly with the structured safeguards proposed. Further discussion at this point may yield diminishing returns, and I’m ready to move forward with a proposal that synthesizes our collective understanding to best serve our company’s goals for growth and stability.</p><p><br>

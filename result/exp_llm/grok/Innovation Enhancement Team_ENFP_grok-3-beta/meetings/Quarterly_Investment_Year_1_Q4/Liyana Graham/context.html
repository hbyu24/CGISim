<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p><h2>Reflection: Annual Budget Year 1</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham’s Reflection on Annual Budget Meeting Year 1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I consistently advocated for a cautious and stability-focused approach, initially supporting Option A, which allocates 50% of funds evenly across the four quarters. I expressed concerns about the higher exposure in Options C and D, especially given our lack of historical data and the uncertainties this introduces. Throughout the discussions, I acknowledged the merits of a progressive allocation strategy but remained wary of the 40% allocation proposed for Q4 in Option D. I gradually became more open to Option B as a potential middle ground, appreciating its gradual increase to 20% in Q4 as a balanced compromise between risk and growth. The CEO, Robyn McClure, acknowledged and valued my perspective on caution and stability, encouraging further exploration of balanced approaches. Ultimately, the voting resulted in the approval of Option D with 66.7% support, including votes from the CEO and several shareholders. My preferred option, Option A, was not adopted; however, my shift toward Option B reflected a significant evolution in my stance during the meeting.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
The CEO demonstrated strong leadership by facilitating thorough and structured discussions, ensuring all shareholders’ perspectives were heard. Robyn effectively summarized key points, restated objectives, and maintained focus on the predefined options, which helped keep the meeting productive. The CEO’s enthusiasm for Option D and her articulation of its strategic balance between early caution and later growth aligned well with several shareholders’ views, driving consensus toward a bold growth strategy. However, the CEO could have further addressed the concerns raised by more cautious shareholders, such as myself and Lenny, by considering more explicitly how the risks associated with higher late-year allocations would be mitigated in practice. The decision-making process was collaborative and comprehensive, with multiple rounds enabling deep analysis of risk, opportunity, and long-term impact. While the final decision for Option D reflects a growth-oriented stance that fits the stable market context, I remain concerned that it may expose the company to higher risk than I am comfortable with in our inaugural year without historical data.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting highlighted the complexity of balancing risk and growth in early-stage corporate budgeting, especially when historical data is unavailable. I learned that progressive allocation strategies, when paired with structured risk management such as quarterly benchmarks and asset selection strategies, can offer a viable path toward cautious growth. Moving forward, I plan to integrate this understanding by advocating for explicit risk assessment mechanisms and checkpoints in future discussions to safeguard stability while allowing adaptability. I noticed a pattern where shareholders favoring growth embraced strategic safeguards to mitigate exposure, whereas caution-focused members prioritized steady, predictable allocations. Recognizing these dynamics will help me anticipate and engage more effectively in future debates. My key takeaway is the importance of remaining open to compromise—like my shift from Option A to increased confidence in Option B—while steadfastly championing prudent risk management aligned with my ISFJ preference for security and detailed planning. This balanced approach will guide my participation to ensure the company pursues sustainable, well-considered growth.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q1</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q1</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my position advocating for investing in Bonds for Q1, emphasizing their low to medium risk and steady returns as the most prudent choice given our lack of historical data and the stable market environment. Throughout the discussions, I articulated the importance of structured risk management through performance thresholds—specifically proposing a 1.5% return benchmark and periodic market volatility reviews—to ensure a secure foundation while allowing for a measured transition to higher-risk assets like real estate in later quarters. CEO Robyn McClure acknowledged and valued my cautious approach, encouraging further refinement of these safeguards and their integration into the broader investment strategy under Option D’s progressive allocation. Despite the CEO’s initial proposal for Real Estate, the final voting resulted in Bonds being approved with 66.7% support, including my affirmative vote. My preferred option was ultimately adopted, reflecting a successful alignment of my cautious perspective with the company’s decision.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated commendable leadership by fostering respectful and inclusive dialogue, ensuring all shareholder perspectives—including my cautious stance—were heard and thoughtfully considered. Her ability to summarize complex viewpoints and encourage structured risk management discussions helped the group navigate differing risk appetites constructively. For example, her openness to incorporating performance benchmarks and volatility reviews into the decision-making framework showcased adaptability and responsiveness. However, the CEO could improve by more proactively addressing risk concerns earlier in the process to build consensus sooner; the initial preference for Real Estate, while well-articulated, met significant resistance that might have been mitigated with earlier integration of conservative safeguards. The company’s decision-making process was collaborative and thorough, featuring multiple rounds that allowed deep exploration of risk tolerance and strategic fit. The final decision to invest in Bonds reflects a balanced and practical outcome, prioritizing stability in this inaugural quarter while laying groundwork for future growth, which I believe is sound and well-suited to the company’s current context.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the importance of structured risk management mechanisms—such as clear performance thresholds and regular volatility assessments—in reconciling diverse shareholder risk preferences, especially in early-stage investment decisions without historical data. I learned that advocating for cautious options like Bonds can be effectively integrated into a progressive allocation strategy when coupled with transparent, data-driven safeguards that facilitate measured transitions to higher-risk assets. Moving forward, I plan to proactively propose specific benchmarks and monitoring frameworks early in discussions to expedite consensus-building and ensure stability remains central. I also noticed a pattern where shareholders with growth-oriented tendencies embraced risk mitigation strategies as a means to justify bolder investments, while more cautious members prioritized predictable, steady allocations. Recognizing this dynamic will help me tailor my contributions to bridge viewpoints and foster collaborative solutions. My key takeaway is the value of patience and openness to compromise—remaining firm in advocating for security while supporting structured pathways to growth—to guide my ongoing participation and help the company achieve sustainable, well-balanced investment outcomes.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q2</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q2</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
In this meeting, I maintained my cautious stance by advocating for continued investment in Bonds for Q2, emphasizing their proven 5% return from Q1 and their alignment with our priority for stability during these early investment stages. I proposed setting a 4.5% return benchmark and implementing regular market reviews to ensure ongoing prudent oversight, echoing Lenny McLaughlin’s similar suggestions. Throughout the discussions, I acknowledged the appeal of Real Estate’s 10% return and the CEO Robyn McClure’s and Jazmin Hoover’s advocacy for it, as well as the strong enthusiasm from Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano for Stocks with their 20% return potential. However, I expressed concerns about increasing risk exposure prematurely, underscoring the importance of building a solid data foundation first. The CEO responded positively to my input, recognizing my focus on stability and encouraging exploration of structured plans for gradual transitions into higher-risk assets in future quarters. Voting outcomes reflected a divided board: the initial proposal for Real Estate was rejected (33.3% approval), and the alternative proposal for Bonds received 50% approval but also failed to pass. Ultimately, the CEO exercised executive decision-making to select Bonds as the final investment for Q2, which aligned with my preferred option.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated strong facilitation skills by fostering an inclusive environment where diverse views were respectfully heard and integrated. She skillfully summarized complex arguments, encouraged structured risk management discussions, and adapted her proposal in response to shareholder feedback by offering Bonds as an alternative after the Real Estate proposal was rejected. For instance, Robyn’s openness to consider safeguards such as return benchmarks, loss limits, and review schedules across asset options showcased her commitment to balancing growth ambitions with caution. Areas for improvement include anticipating risk concerns earlier in the process to build broader consensus more efficiently, as the initial enthusiasm for Real Estate encountered substantial resistance. The company’s decision-making process was collaborative and thorough, with multiple rounds providing space for deep analysis of risk tolerance and strategic alignment. Although the final executive decision to invest in Bonds reflects a conservative choice, I believe it appropriately safeguards the company’s interests given our early stage and limited historical data, setting a stable foundation for future growth.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced the critical importance of balancing immediate stability with long-term growth under a progressive allocation strategy, especially in the absence of extensive historical data. I learned that structured risk management mechanisms—such as clear performance benchmarks, loss limits, and regular reviews—are essential tools to reconcile differing shareholder risk appetites and facilitate measured transitions to higher-risk assets. Moving forward, I intend to proactively propose such specific safeguards early in discussions to expedite consensus-building and ensure prudence remains central. I also noticed a consistent pattern where growth-oriented shareholders embraced ambitious investments supported by robust risk controls, while more cautious members prioritized secure, steady allocations. Recognizing these dynamics enables me to better anticipate debate trajectories and tailor my approach to bridge viewpoints effectively. My key takeaway is the value of steadfast advocacy for security combined with openness to compromise and structured progression, which aligns with my ISFJ preference for detailed planning and reliability. This balanced stance will guide my future participation to help the company pursue sustainable and well-considered growth.</p><p><br>
<h2>Reflection: Quarterly Investment Year 1 Q3</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham’s Reflection on Quarterly Investment Meeting Year 1 Q3</p><p>1. IMPORTANT EVENTS  <br>
During this meeting, I maintained my consistent cautious stance by advocating for investing in Bonds for Q3, emphasizing their reliable 5% return in both Q1 and Q2 and their alignment with our need for stability at this early stage. I underscored the importance of predictability and building a solid data foundation before transitioning to higher-risk assets like Real Estate or Stocks. Throughout the discussion rounds, I proposed structured safeguards such as a 4.5% return threshold and regular market condition reviews to ensure security while allowing for measured progress. CEO Robyn McClure recognized and valued my perspective, encouraging balanced approaches and integration of risk management frameworks. While the CEO initially favored Real Estate and others advocated for Stocks, I remained firm in my preference for Bonds. The initial proposal for Real Estate was rejected with only 33.3% support, and the CEO’s alternative proposal for Bonds received 50% approval but also failed to pass. Ultimately, as no consensus was reached, the CEO exercised executive decision-making to select Bonds as the final investment for Q3, aligning with my preferred option.</p><p>2. CEO &amp; COMPANY EVALUATION  <br>
CEO Robyn McClure demonstrated strong leadership by fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment throughout the two rounds of discussion, encouraging shareholders to share diverse perspectives and thoughtfully considering risk management strategies. She clearly articulated her initial enthusiasm for Real Estate’s balanced risk-return profile while remaining open to integrating cautious viewpoints, such as mine, by supporting structured safeguards like return benchmarks and market reviews. However, an area for improvement would be anticipating shareholders’ risk concerns earlier in the process to build consensus more efficiently, as evidenced by the initial rejection of her Real Estate proposal. The company’s decision-making process was thorough and respectful, allowing for deep exploration of risk tolerance and strategic fit. The final executive decision to invest in Bonds reflects a prudent choice that prioritizes stability and aligns with the cautious majority’s preferences, which I believe is a sound and responsible outcome for the company’s early investment phase.</p><p>3. LESSONS &amp; REFLECTIONS  <br>
This meeting reinforced my conviction in the value of cautious, data-driven decision-making that prioritizes stability as a foundation for sustainable growth. I learned that well-structured risk management frameworks, including clear return thresholds and regular market condition reviews, are essential tools to reconcile differing risk appetites and facilitate gradual transitions to higher-risk assets. I also observed that while growth-oriented shareholders favor bolder strategies supported by safeguards, cautious members like myself seek predictable outcomes and steady progress, highlighting the importance of bridging these perspectives through compromise and structured safeguards. Moving forward, I plan to proactively propose specific benchmarks and risk mitigation frameworks early in discussions to expedite consensus-building and ensure our investment choices align with both security and progressive growth. The key takeaway is the necessity of balancing openness to growth opportunities with steadfast advocacy for trust and stability, which will guide my future participation and support the company’s long-term success.</p><p></p><p></p><p><h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. I appreciate everyone&#x27;s presence and input today.</p><p>For this quarter, we have $41211.03 allocated for investment in this stable market environment. </p><p>Historical Asset Performance:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%<br>
  Quarter 2: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 0.0%, Stocks: -10.0%<br>
  Quarter 3: Cash: 2.0%, Bonds: 5.0%, Real_Estate: 10.0%, Stocks: 20.0%</p><p><br>
Previous Investment Decisions:</p><p>Year 1 (1971) - Stable Market:<br>
  Quarter 1: Invested $10000.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($500.00)<br>
  Quarter 2: Invested $20100.00 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($1005.00)<br>
  Quarter 3: Invested $30451.50 in Bonds, Return: 5.0% ($1522.58)</p><p><br>
My analysis of our historical performance: Robyn McClure As Robyn McClure, I’m excited to highlight that Bonds have shown a consistent 5% return across all quarters, offering a stable and low-risk foundation that aligns with our need for security in this stable market. Real Estate and Stocks, while showing higher potential returns of 10% and 20% respectively in certain quarters, exhibit significant variability with 0% and -10% dips, which reminds us to approach them with caution despite my ENFP enthusiasm for bold growth. I believe we can build on Bonds’ reliability as a base while exploring calculated risks with Real Estate or Stocks in future quarters, supported by robust risk management strategies.</p><p>    Today, we need to decide which asset to invest in for this quarter. Our options are:</p><p>    - Cash Savings: Low risk, low return.<br>
    - Bonds: Low to medium risk, low to medium return.<br>
    - Real Estate: Medium risk, medium return.<br>
    - Stocks: High risk, high return.</p><p>    Each asset class has different risk-return profiles that may perform differently given our current market conditions.</p><p>    Our objective today is to thoroughly evaluate these options, consider our company&#x27;s risk tolerance in the current stable market, and select the investment that offers the best balance of risk and potential return. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, after which I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the optimal asset for this quarter, followed by a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin by sharing your thoughts on the current market environment and which asset might be most appropriate.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Liyana Graham CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 10%<br>
- Bonds: 70%<br>
- Real Estate: 15%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: As I reflect on the current stable market and our company’s performance so far, I find myself drawn to the consistent 5% return that Bonds have delivered across all three quarters this year, aligning perfectly with my cautious and stability-focused nature as an ISFJ. The predictability of Bonds offers a secure foundation, especially important to me given the variability in Real Estate (ranging from 0% to 10%) and Stocks (from -10% to 20%), which introduce risks I’m not yet comfortable with at this stage. While I acknowledge the higher potential returns of Real Estate and Stocks, my priority remains building a solid base of historical data and trust before transitioning to riskier assets, even with our larger Q4 allocation of $41,211.03. Bonds, with their low to medium risk profile, provide the steady growth I value, ensuring we protect our capital while still achieving reasonable returns. I remain open to considering other perspectives, but my initial stance is to advocate for Bonds to maintain our prudent approach.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Review of historical performance and lessons learned from previous quarters | Expected outcome: Establish a shared understanding of asset performance trends and key takeaways to inform our Q4 decision&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure Welcome, everyone, to our Q4 investment meeting for Year 1. My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because, as I reflect on our journey so far, I’m thrilled by the potential for growth in this stable market, and I find myself drawn to Real Estate for Q4 due to its balanced medium risk and medium return profile, with a historical average of 6.7% and strong 10% returns in two of the last three quarters. My ENFP optimism and adventurous spirit see this as an exciting opportunity to build momentum, especially with our larger $41,211.03 allocation this quarter, while still managing risk through the safeguards we’ve developed. While Bonds have provided a reliable 5% return and a secure foundation, I believe we’re now positioned to take a calculated step forward with Real Estate to capture higher growth without the extreme volatility of Stocks. I’m eager to explore this path, knowing we can adapt with structured benchmarks and reviews, and I remain open to shareholder insights that might refine this perspective, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>For this first round, I’d like to focus on the theme of reviewing historical performance and lessons learned from previous quarters, with the goal of establishing a shared understanding of asset performance trends and key takeaways to inform our Q4 decision. I believe this round can help us synthesize diverse perspectives by reflecting on how each asset—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—has performed in the stable market conditions of Q1 through Q3, and what insights we can draw to guide us with this significant allocation. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.</p><p>I invite each of you to share your thoughts on the historical data, particularly any patterns or lessons that stand out, and how they might shape our approach for Q4, especially if there are aspects I may not have fully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Jazmin Hoover</h4></p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see our shared focus on historical performance, Robyn, and I agree with your assessment of Real Estate as a promising option for Q4 given its 10% returns in Q1 and Q3, averaging 6.7% overall, which signals recovery and potential for sustainable growth with our $41,211.03 allocation. Reflecting on past quarters, Bonds have provided a consistent 5% return, serving as a solid foundation, but I believe the lesson here is that our progressive allocation strategy under Option D now supports a calculated step towards higher growth, where Real Estate offers a balanced medium risk compared to the significant volatility of Stocks, which dropped to -10% in Q2. My takeaway is that we can leverage Real Estate’s stability over Stocks by implementing safeguards like return benchmarks and monthly reviews to manage risk effectively, and I’m eager to hear others’ insights on how we can further refine this approach for Q4.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for reinforcing the potential of Real Estate with its strong 10% returns in Q1 and Q3, and for highlighting how our progressive allocation strategy under Option D supports this calculated step toward growth. I particularly appreciate your focus on safeguards like return benchmarks and monthly reviews, as they align with my vision of balancing ambition with prudence, and they provide a practical framework for managing risk with our substantial $41,211.03 allocation. I’m excited to build on this shared perspective and hear from others on how we can further refine these strategies to ensure success in Q4.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I&#x27;m pleased, Robyn, that we share a vision for Real Estate as a balanced growth option for Q4, and I’d like to build on this by noting that the variability in Real Estate returns—10% in Q1 and Q3, but 0% in Q2—teaches us the importance of timing and market monitoring, which our proposed safeguards like monthly reviews can address effectively with this $41,211.03 allocation. I also think our consistent success with Bonds at 5% each quarter highlights the value of a stable base, yet under Option D’s progressive framework, transitioning to Real Estate now could optimize long-term gains if we refine our risk thresholds together. I’m keen to hear from others on additional strategies or lessons from past quarters that might further strengthen this approach.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for highlighting the critical lesson of timing and market monitoring with Real Estate’s variable returns, and for underscoring how our consistent 5% returns from Bonds have provided a strong foundation. I’m energized by your suggestion to refine risk thresholds together under Option D’s progressive framework, as it complements my vision of balancing growth with caution, and I look forward to hearing others’ strategies to further strengthen our approach for this $41,211.03 allocation in Q4.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled, Robyn, to see our aligned thinking on leveraging lessons from past quarters, and I’d like to emphasize that the timing for Real Estate in Q4 feels optimal given our larger $41,211.03 allocation under Option D, allowing us to capitalize on its 6.7% average return while using structured safeguards to mitigate the variability seen in Q2. I also appreciate your enthusiasm for refining risk thresholds collaboratively, and I propose we consider setting a specific 8% return benchmark for Real Estate to ensure we balance growth with caution. I’m eager to hear others’ thoughts on this or additional risk management ideas to solidify our approach for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for proposing a specific 8% return benchmark for Real Estate, as it’s a concrete step that builds on our lessons from past quarters and strengthens our approach to managing variability with this $41,211.03 allocation. I’m enthusiastic about integrating such structured safeguards to balance growth and caution, and I’m eager to hear from others on this idea or additional risk management strategies that could further solidify our Q4 decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
Jazmin Hoover: &quot;I&#x27;m glad, Robyn, that you see the value in the 8% return benchmark for Real Estate, as it directly addresses the variability we’ve observed in previous quarters and ensures we maintain a disciplined approach to growth with our $41,211.03 allocation. I believe this safeguard, paired with monthly reviews, can help us capitalize on Real Estate’s potential while mitigating risks, reflecting the lessons learned from both its strong 10% returns and the 0% dip in Q2. I’m looking forward to hearing others’ perspectives on this benchmark or any additional strategies to further strengthen our Q4 investment decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Jazmin, for emphasizing the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews as key safeguards for Real Estate, as they directly address the variability we’ve seen in past quarters and provide a disciplined framework for growth with our $41,211.03 allocation. I’m excited by how these strategies reflect the lessons we’ve learned from both the strong 10% returns and the 0% dip in Q2, and I’m keen to hear from other shareholders on this benchmark or any additional ideas to further enhance our approach for Q4.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn and Jazmin, for your thoughtful analysis of Real Estate’s potential and the proposed safeguards like the 8% return benchmark. Reflecting on the historical performance over the past three quarters, I’m struck by the unwavering consistency of Bonds, delivering a steady 5% return each quarter, which has provided us with a reliable foundation in this stable market. My key takeaway is that while Real Estate’s average return of 6.7% is appealing, its variability—with a 0% return in Q2—underscores a level of uncertainty that I believe we should avoid at this stage, especially when Bonds offer predictable growth that aligns with our need for stability as we build more historical data for future decisions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for underscoring the consistent 5% return of Bonds across all quarters, as it reinforces the critical role of stability in our investment strategy, especially at this early stage with limited historical data.

- Liyana Graham (self): Favors Bonds for their predictability and stability, cautious about Real Estate’s variability, yet open to Real Estate if strong safeguards like return benchmarks and loss limits are applied; confidence: certain.</p><p><h3>Analysis of CEO&#x27;s Position</h3><br>
CEO Robyn McClure favors investing in Real Estate for Q4, highlighting its balanced medium risk and medium return profile with strong historical performance. She emphasizes growth potential while advocating for robust risk management safeguards, such as return benchmarks and regular reviews, to mitigate variability. Robyn’s position aligns with shareholders who support growth but also incorporates caution by valuing stability from Bonds as a foundation. Throughout the discussion, she remains open to integrating shareholder input, particularly around risk thresholds and contingency plans, showing a collaborative and adaptive approach. Her stance reflects a strategic shift from early caution toward calculated growth, balancing optimism with prudence.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 8%<br>
- Bonds: 65%<br>
- Real Estate: 22%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO and Jazmin Hoover’s advocacy for Real Estate, with its historical 10% returns in Q1 and Q3 and proposed safeguards like an 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, has slightly increased my openness to this option. Lenny McLaughlin’s support for Bonds due to their consistent 5% return reinforces my initial stance, though his willingness to consider Real Estate with strong safeguards encourages me to do the same. Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano’s emphasis on Stocks’ high 20% returns, tempered by robust risk management strategies like loss limits and volatility thresholds, is noted but does not align with my risk tolerance.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has made me more aware of the potential for balanced growth through Real Estate when paired with actionable safeguards, which I hadn’t fully weighed before. While I still prioritize stability, I recognize that my initial focus on Bonds might have undervalued the structured risk mitigation strategies proposed for Real Estate. This round has nudged me to refine my perspective by integrating a slightly higher tolerance for calculated risk, provided protective measures are concrete and reliable.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: I continue to favor Bonds for their consistent 5% return across all quarters, which aligns with my cautious nature and prioritizes a stable foundation, especially important with our limited historical data. However, the discussion around Real Estate’s potential, supported by safeguards like return benchmarks and contingency plans, has made me more open to considering it as a viable option. I believe Bonds still offer the predictability we need for Q4 with our substantial $41,211.03 allocation, ensuring we protect our capital while building data for future decisions.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we have made significant progress in Round 1 by establishing a shared understanding of historical performance and the lessons learned from previous quarters. However, there are still diverse perspectives on the acceptable level of risk for Q4, and I feel that another round of discussion focused on assessing our risk tolerance and strategic alignment will help us further refine our approach. This additional dialogue will allow us to address lingering concerns about variability in Real Estate and Stocks, explore the robustness of proposed safeguards, and potentially build stronger consensus before moving to a proposal and vote. I’m eager to continue this collaborative process to ensure we make the most well-informed decision for our $41,211.03 allocation.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Robyn McClure has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of risk tolerance and strategic alignment for Q4 in a stable market | Expected outcome: Evaluate how each asset fits our company’s risk appetite and progressive allocation goals with the larger $41,211.03 allocation&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Robyn McClure I&#x27;m thrilled to kick off Round 2 of our Q4 investment meeting with a focus on &#x27;Assessment of risk tolerance and strategic alignment for Q4 in a stable market.&#x27; My current thinking is that Real Estate appears most promising because, after reflecting on the diverse perspectives shared in this round, I remain convinced that Real Estate offers the best balance of risk and return for Q4 with our $41,211.03 allocation, given its historical average of 6.7% and strong 10% returns in two quarters. The actionable safeguards proposed, such as the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, address the variability concerns and align with my ENFP vision for cautious yet impactful growth. While Bonds’ consistent 5% return is compelling for stability, I believe we are now positioned to take a calculated step forward with Real Estate to build momentum, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding.</p><p>This round provides us with an opportunity to evaluate how each asset—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—fits our company’s risk appetite and aligns with our progressive allocation goals, especially with this substantial allocation. I encourage us to dive deep into how our risk tolerance matches with the potential returns and volatility of each option, integrating our historical insights to build a more complete picture. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Cash&#x27;, &#x27;Bonds&#x27;, &#x27;Real Estate&#x27;, &#x27;Stocks&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options. I&#x27;m eager to hear your thoughts on how we can balance caution with ambition, and I invite you to share any insights or concerns that might enhance our collective decision-making for this quarter.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Corey Harvey</h4></p><p><br>
Corey Harvey: &quot;I’m excited to dive into this discussion on risk tolerance and strategic alignment for Q4, and while I appreciate Robyn and Jazmin’s focus on Real Estate’s balanced profile with its 6.7% historical average and safeguards like the 8% return benchmark, I strongly believe Stocks offer a more compelling opportunity for growth with their 20% returns in Q1 and Q3, aligning perfectly with our progressive allocation strategy and the substantial $41,211.03 allocation. My perspective is driven by a desire to set a dynamic tone for our portfolio in this stable market, and I’m confident we can manage the high risk through strict measures like a 5% volatility threshold, a 3% loss limit, and bi-weekly reviews, which build on the risk management ideas already discussed. I’d love to hear from others, especially those favoring Bonds or Real Estate, on how we might balance this ambition with caution to ensure we’re maximizing our potential while protecting our foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for bringing forward the compelling growth potential of Stocks with their 20% returns in Q1 and Q3, and for outlining robust safeguards like the 5% volatility threshold and 3% loss limit to manage the high risk with our $41,211.03 allocation.

Corey Harvey: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for recognizing the growth potential of Stocks and the importance of the safeguards I’ve proposed, like the 5% volatility threshold and 3% loss limit, to manage risks with our $41,211.03 allocation. I’m eager to integrate the caution highlighted by supporters of Bonds and Real Estate by suggesting we could adopt a hybrid approach within our progressive strategy, perhaps tightening our review frequency to weekly if needed, to ensure we’re responsive to any market shifts while still pursuing the dynamic returns Stocks offer. I’d love to hear from Lenny and Liyana on whether these enhanced measures could address their stability concerns, helping us balance ambition with prudence in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for highlighting the dynamic growth potential of Stocks and the robust safeguards like the 5% volatility threshold and 3% loss limit, which add depth to our risk tolerance discussion for the $41,211.03 allocation. I must remind us to focus solely on our predefined options—Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks—without exploring hybrid approaches, but I truly value your emphasis on enhanced risk management and would like to hear from Lenny and Liyana on how these measures might influence their views on Stocks as a standalone option. Your input helps us explore how to balance ambition with prudence within our established framework in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>

This dialogue could help us strike the right balance between ambition and caution under our progressive allocation strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Corey, for reiterating the impressive growth potential of Stocks with their 20% returns in Q1 and Q3, and for emphasizing the safeguards like the 5% volatility threshold and 3% loss limit to manage risks with our $41,211.03 allocation.

<h4>Exchange with Lenny McLaughlin</h4></p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points raised by Robyn, Jazmin, and Corey regarding Real Estate and Stocks, especially the detailed safeguards like the 8% return benchmark for Real Estate and the 5% volatility threshold for Stocks, which show a commitment to managing risk with our $41,211.03 allocation. However, I remain convinced that Bonds best align with our company’s risk appetite at this stage, given their consistent 5% return across all quarters, ensuring stability as we continue to build historical data under our progressive allocation strategy. I’m open to considering Real Estate if the proposed monthly reviews and benchmarks prove robust, but I’d like to hear more on how these measures can guarantee protection against variability before moving away from the secure foundation Bonds provide.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for emphasizing the importance of stability with Bonds and their consistent 5% return, which is a critical consideration for our risk appetite with the $41,211.03 allocation. I’m encouraged by your openness to Real Estate and want to assure you that the proposed safeguards, like the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, are designed to closely monitor and mitigate variability, and I’d love to explore with you and others how we can further strengthen these measures to provide the protection you’re seeking. Your input is vital in helping us balance the secure foundation of Bonds with the potential for balanced growth in Real Estate under our progressive allocation strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for addressing my concerns and for your commitment to strengthening the safeguards for Real Estate, such as the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, with our $41,211.03 allocation. I’d like to hear more specifics on how these measures would be implemented to ensure protection against the kind of variability we saw in Q2 with a 0% return, as this is critical for me to feel secure in moving away from the proven stability of Bonds. This clarity could help bridge my preference for caution with the potential for balanced growth under our progressive allocation strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for seeking clarity on how the safeguards for Real Estate, such as the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, would be implemented to protect against variability like the 0% return in Q2 with our $41,211.03 allocation. I envision these measures involving a structured process where we set clear performance thresholds—if returns dip below 8% in any given month, we’d trigger an immediate review to assess market conditions and adjust our strategy, potentially reallocating resources if necessary within the quarter. I’d love to hear your thoughts and those of others on how we can further detail or strengthen these protocols to ensure they provide the security you need to confidently transition from Bonds’ stability to Real Estate’s balanced growth potential under our progressive allocation strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for outlining the structured process for Real Estate safeguards, particularly the immediate review trigger if returns fall below 8% and the potential for resource reallocation within the quarter. I appreciate this level of detail as it addresses my concerns about variability, though I’d like to suggest adding a predefined contingency plan, such as a specific loss limit, to ensure we have a clear exit strategy if market conditions deteriorate unexpectedly. This addition could provide the extra layer of security I need to feel more confident in transitioning from the stability of Bonds to Real Estate’s balanced growth potential with our $41,211.03 allocation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure: &quot;Thank you, Lenny, for proposing the addition of a predefined contingency plan with a specific loss limit for Real Estate, as it adds a crucial layer of security to address variability concerns with our $41,211.03 allocation. I believe integrating a clear exit strategy, such as a defined loss threshold, alongside the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, could significantly strengthen our risk management approach and provide the reassurance needed to transition from Bonds’ stability. I’d love to hear from others on how we might set this loss limit or further refine these safeguards to ensure we balance caution with the growth potential of Real Estate under our progressive allocation strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Lenny McLaughlin: &quot;Thank you, Robyn, for embracing the idea of a predefined contingency plan with a loss limit for Real Estate, as it significantly bolsters the security I’m seeking with our $41,211.03 allocation. I suggest setting this loss limit at 5%, aligning with some of the thresholds discussed for other assets, which would trigger an immediate reassessment and potential exit if reached, ensuring we protect our capital while still exploring Real Estate’s growth potential. I’m eager to hear from others on whether this threshold feels appropriate or if additional refinements could further balance caution with ambition under our progressive allocation strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h2>My Speech Decision for Round 2</h2></p><p>Decision: Speak<br>
Reasoning: I believe I have a meaningful perspective to contribute on the theme of risk tolerance and strategic alignment for Q4, particularly from a cautious standpoint that prioritizes stability.

Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano strongly supported Stocks, highlighting their high growth potential with 20% returns in Q1 and Q3. Lenny McLaughlin and Liyana Graham favored Bonds, prioritizing their consistent 5% return as a secure foundation, while expressing conditional openness to Real Estate if robust safeguards are in place.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Specific Arguments and Evidence**: Supporters of Real Estate, including myself and Jazmin, focused on its historical 10% returns in Q1 and Q3, proposing safeguards like an 8% return benchmark, monthly reviews, and a 5% loss limit suggested by Lenny, with Liyana adding a one-week reassessment timeline and a 3% preliminary loss alert to mitigate variability with our $41,211.03 allocation. Advocates for Stocks, Corey and Sulayman, underscored the 20% return potential, proposing strict risk management measures such as a 5% volatility threshold, 3% loss limit, and bi-weekly reviews to balance high risk with caution in this stable market. Proponents of Bonds, Lenny and Liyana, emphasized the consistent 5% return across all quarters as a stable base, valuing the security it provides while remaining open to Real Estate with enhanced protective measures.</p><p>4. **Identification of Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**: We’ve reached consensus on the stable market offering opportunities for growth, the importance of aligning our choice with our progressive allocation strategy, and the critical need for robust risk management safeguards to balance ambition with caution. Disagreement persists on the acceptable level of risk for Q4, with preferences ranging from the cautious stability of Bonds, the balanced growth of Real Estate, to the ambitious high returns of Stocks, reflecting diverse perspectives on how to best meet our risk appetite and long-term objectives.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**: I believe we’ve made significant progress in assessing our risk tolerance and the strategic fit of each asset for Q4 under our $41,211.03 allocation. The detailed proposals for risk mitigation across all options—whether through benchmarks, loss limits, review frequencies, or preliminary alerts—have deepened our understanding of how to balance immediate caution with long-term growth ambitions, setting a strong foundation for consensus-building in the next round.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**: I want to remind everyone that we must choose only from our predefined options: Cash, Bonds, Real Estate, and Stocks. All discussions have stayed within these parameters, and I appreciate the focus on evaluating these specific choices without introducing external modifications.</p><p>7. **Indication of Next Steps or Issues to Address**: Moving into the final round, I encourage us to focus on consensus-building and addressing any lingering concerns or hesitations about our top options. Let’s build on the risk management strategies and strategic insights shared today to finalize our decision on the optimal asset for Q4, ensuring it aligns with both our risk appetite and long-term growth goals. I look forward to synthesizing our collective perspectives as we work toward a unified investment choice.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Liyana Graham, I consistently emphasized the importance of stability and predictability by advocating for Bonds, highlighting their reliable 5% return as the best fit for our company’s risk appetite with the substantial $41,211.03 Q4 allocation. I acknowledged the CEO’s and other shareholders’ support for Real Estate’s growth potential but expressed concerns about its variability, particularly the 0% return in Q2, and insisted on robust safeguards—including an 8% return benchmark, a 5% loss limit with immediate reassessment, a one-week timeline for decision-making upon loss triggers, and a preliminary alert at 3% loss—to mitigate risk and protect our capital. The CEO responded positively, valuing my cautious approach and willingness to consider Real Estate contingent on these strong, actionable risk management measures. We agreed on the necessity of balancing growth ambitions with a secure foundation, though some disagreement remained regarding the acceptable risk level, reflecting a collaborative but cautious dialogue focused on refining safeguards to align with our progressive</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
In Round 2, Jazmin Hoover continued to support Real Estate, emphasizing its balanced medium risk and return profile, and advocated for safeguards like an 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews to mitigate past variability. Lenny McLaughlin favored Bonds for their consistent 5% returns and stability but remained open to Real Estate if robust safeguards—including monthly reviews, an 8% benchmark, and a 5% loss limit with immediate reassessment—were clearly implemented to protect against risk. Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano strongly backed Stocks, highlighting their high growth potential with 20% returns and proposing strict risk management measures such as a 5% volatility threshold, 3% loss limit, bi-weekly performance reviews, and clear exit criteria to balance ambition with caution. While there was consensus on the need for robust risk management, notable disagreements persisted regarding the acceptable level of risk for Q4, with positions ranging from cautious Bonds to balanced Real Estate and ambitious Stocks.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Robyn McClure clearly favors investing in Real Estate for Q4, citing its balanced medium risk and medium return profile with strong historical performance, including 10% returns in two quarters. She emphasizes the importance of robust risk management safeguards such as an 8% return benchmark, monthly reviews, and contingency plans to address variability concerns.

<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 2</h2></p><p>Liyana Graham UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Cash: 5%<br>
- Bonds: 60%<br>
- Real Estate: 30%<br>
- Stocks: 5%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: The CEO and Jazmin Hoover’s strong advocacy for Real Estate, supported by detailed safeguards like the 8% return benchmark, monthly reviews, and the integration of my proposed 5% loss limit with a one-week reassessment timeline and 3% preliminary loss alert, has increased my confidence in Real Estate as a viable option. Lenny McLaughlin’s support for Bonds reinforces my preference for stability, but his openness to Real Estate with robust safeguards encourages me to consider a balanced transition. Corey Harvey and Sulayman Serrano’s focus on Stocks’ 20% return potential with risk management measures like volatility thresholds and loss limits is noted, but their high risk still does not align with my cautious nature.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has deepened my awareness of how structured risk management can bridge the gap between stability and growth, prompting me to reassess my initial strong bias toward Bonds. I’ve realized that my focus on predictability may have undervalued the potential of Real Estate when paired with actionable, responsive safeguards like the ones I proposed and the CEO endorsed. My thinking has evolved to incorporate a higher tolerance for calculated risk, provided these protective measures are firmly in place, though I still prioritize a secure foundation.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Bonds<br>
REASONING: I continue to favor Bonds for their consistent 5% return across all quarters, which aligns with my cautious ISFJ nature and ensures stability with our substantial $41,211.03 allocation. However, the detailed safeguards proposed for Real Estate, including my suggestions for a loss limit, reassessment timeline, and preliminary alert, have significantly increased my confidence in it as a balanced alternative. I believe Bonds still provide the predictability we need at this stage, but I’m more open to transitioning to Real Estate if these protective measures are guaranteed.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Robyn McClure decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we have thoroughly explored the key aspects of risk tolerance and strategic alignment for our Q4 investment decision through two comprehensive rounds of discussion. The detailed insights and robust risk management strategies shared—such as the safeguards for Real Estate including the 8% return benchmark, monthly reviews, 5% loss limit, and 3% preliminary loss alert, as well as the protective measures for Stocks and the stability of Bonds—have provided a strong foundation for making an informed choice with our $41,211.03 allocation. While diverse perspectives on acceptable risk levels persist, I’m confident that we’ve gathered sufficient input to synthesize a proposal that balances caution with ambition under our progressive allocation strategy. Moving to the proposal and voting phase now will allow us to focus on finalizing a decision efficiently, and I’m prepared to address any lingering concerns through the voting process or alternative proposals if needed.</p><p><br>

<h2>Voting Results: Initial Proposal</h2></p><p>Proposal: Real Estate</p><p>Results: 2/6 votes in favor (33.3%). The proposal was REJECTED.</p><p>Individual votes:<br>
- Sulayman Serrano: Reject - I must respectfully reject the proposal to invest in Real Estate for Q4, as I firmly believe that Stocks offer a superior opportunity for growth with their historical 20% return potential in two quarters, which aligns better with our progressive allocation strategy and the substantial $41,211.03 allocation in this stable market. While I appreciate the balanced risk-return profile of Real Estate and the robust safeguards proposed, such as the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, my drive for innovation and dynamic growth compels me to prioritize a bolder strategy that can maximize our portfolio’s potential. I remain confident that with strict risk management measures like volatility thresholds and bi-weekly reviews, we can mitigate risks effectively while pursuing higher returns with Stocks.<br>
- Lenny McLaughlin: Reject - I must respectfully reject the proposal to invest in Real Estate for Q4, as I believe it introduces a level of medium risk and variability that is still premature for our early stage, especially given the inconsistent historical returns with a 0% result in Q2. My risk-averse nature and focus on stability lead me to prioritize a more secure foundation like Bonds, which have consistently delivered a 5% return across all quarters. While I appreciate the proposed safeguards such as the 8% return benchmark and loss limits, I remain convinced that a lower-risk option better aligns with our need for caution at this point.<br>
- Liyana Graham: Reject - I must respectfully reject the proposal to invest in Real Estate for Q4, as I believe it introduces a level of medium risk that remains premature for our current stage, especially given its variability with returns ranging from 0% to 10% across previous quarters. My cautious nature and focus on stability as an ISFJ lead me to prioritize a more secure foundation with Bonds, which have consistently delivered a 5% return. While I appreciate the robust safeguards proposed, such as return benchmarks and loss limits, I feel we need more consistent performance data before transitioning to assets with higher risk profiles.<br>
- Jazmin Hoover: Approve - I am pleased to approve the CEO&#x27;s proposal for Real Estate as our Q4 investment, as it aligns perfectly with my analytical focus on achieving a balanced risk-return profile, supported by its historical average return of 6.7% and strong performance in Q1 and Q3. The comprehensive safeguards discussed, such as the 8% return benchmark, monthly reviews, and additional measures like the 5% loss limit and one-week reassessment timeline, effectively address variability concerns and reinforce my confidence in this choice. I believe Real Estate offers the optimal path for sustainable growth under our progressive allocation strategy with the substantial $41,211.03 allocation, and I trust this decision positions us well for long-term success.<br>
- Corey Harvey: Reject - I must respectfully reject the proposal to invest in Real Estate for Q4, as I believe Stocks offer a far more exciting opportunity for substantial growth with their 20% return potential in Q1 and Q3, especially with our significant $41,211.03 allocation in this stable market. While I appreciate the balanced risk-return profile of Real Estate and the robust safeguards proposed, such as the 8% return benchmark and monthly reviews, my energetic and spontaneous nature drives me to prioritize a bolder strategy that can maximize our portfolio’s potential in this final quarter.<br>
- Robyn McClure: Approve - After deeply reflecting on the insightful discussions and diverse perspectives shared during our Q4 investment meeting, I remain convinced that Real Estate is the optimal choice for our company with the $41,211.03 allocation, as it offers a balanced medium risk and medium return profile that aligns with my ENFP vision for cautious yet impactful growth. The robust safeguards proposed, such as the 8% return benchmark, monthly reviews, 5% loss limit, and 3% preliminary loss alert, effectively address variability concerns while positioning us to build momentum in this stable market. I believe this choice best synthesizes shareholder input and supports our progressive allocation strategy, and I’m prepared to advocate for it with confidence.</p><p><br>

After the proposal was rejected, CEO Robyn McClure decided to create modified proposal.<br>

CEO Robyn McClure made an alternative proposal:</p><p>&quot;Since the previous proposal was not approved, I now propose Bonds. After deeply reflecting on the thoughtful and diverse perspectives shared during our Q4 investment meeting, I believe Bonds offer the best alternative to address the significant concerns about risk exposure and variability raised by several shareholders, while still aligning with our need for a stable foundation in this stable market. As an ENFP leader, my enthusiasm for growth remains strong, but I recognize the importance of building trust and consensus by prioritizing stability with our substantial $41,211.03 allocation. Bonds have consistently delivered a 5% return across all quarters, providing a secure base from which we can transition to riskier assets in future quarters. The robust safeguards discussed, such as a 4.5% return threshold and regular economic reviews, further ensure we balance caution with our progressive allocation strategy. I’m confident this choice respects the cautious priorities of many shareholders and positions us for sustainable growth with confidence.&quot;</p><p></p><p><h2>Alternative Proposal Voting</h2></p><p><br>

I recognize that while I’ve worked to create an inclusive environment and adapted by pivoting from Real Estate to Bonds to address risk concerns, I could have anticipated these apprehensions earlier to build consensus more efficiently. Moving into the coming year, I commit to initiating risk mitigation discussions from the very start, ensuring transparent and regular updates on market conditions and performance, and actively exploring compromise options to bridge diverse risk appetites sooner. I also pledge to refine our decision-making process by incorporating structured feedback loops after each proposal to better align our strategies.

<h2>Previous Meeting Reflections</h2></p><p>No previous meeting reflections found for annual budget Year 1</p><p><br>
<h2>Current Meeting</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Meeting Opening</h2></p><p>CEO Raja Moody opened the meeting with the following statement:</p><p>Welcome everyone to our annual budget meeting for Year 1. Thank you all for joining today.</p><p>Our company currently has $100000.00 in total assets. We are operating in a stable market environment this year. </p><p>As this is our first year, we do not have historical performance data yet. We&#x27;ll need to base our decisions on theoretical risk-return profiles and current market conditions.</p><p>    The today, we need to decide how we&#x27;ll allocate our investment budget across the four quarters of this year. We have four options to consider:</p><p>    - Option A: We allocate 50% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (12.5% per quarter).<br>
    - Option B: We allocate 50% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 5% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 15% in Q3, and 20% in Q4.<br>
    - Option C: We allocate 100% of our total funds, evenly distributed across the four quarters (25% per quarter).<br>
    - Option D: We allocate 100% of our total funds with an increasing allocation: 10% in Q1, 20% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 40% in Q4.</p><p>    Each option presents different levels of risk and opportunity given the current market conditions.</p><p>    The objective of today&#x27;s meeting is to thoroughly discuss these options and come to a decision that best serves our company&#x27;s interests in this stable market environment. We&#x27;ll need to balance potential returns with the associated risks. We&#x27;ll have an open discussion, then I&#x27;ll propose what I believe is the best approach based on our collective input, and we&#x27;ll take a vote requiring a two-thirds majority to proceed.</p><p>    Let&#x27;s begin our discussion with your initial thoughts on these options.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Initial Position Assessment</h2></p><p>Before discussion began, I formed an initial position:</p><p>Hallie Donnelly CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 10%<br>
- Option B: 15%<br>
- Option C: 25%<br>
- Option D: 50%<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option D<br>
REASONING: As a decisive and strategic thinker, I am drawn to Option D because it allows us to fully commit our capital with an increasing allocation that builds momentum throughout the year. In a stable market environment, I believe maximizing our investment exposure while scaling up in later quarters offers the best potential for significant returns, aligning with my focus on long-term growth. I see the escalating allocations as a way to adapt to market insights gained over the year, ensuring we capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach matches my preference for bold, calculated moves that drive success.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 1 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Raja Moody has set the theme: &#x27;Assessment of current market conditions and initial impressions of budget allocation options | Expected outcome: Develop a shared understanding of the stable market environment and gather initial shareholder perspectives on each option’s strengths and weaknesses&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 1 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Raja Moody Welcome, everyone, to our discussion on the budget allocation for Year 1. My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because, as an ISTP, I approach this decision with a practical and analytical mindset, focusing on what makes the most sense in a stable market environment. I believe Option C, allocating 100% of our funds evenly across the quarters, offers the best balance of maximizing capital utilization while maintaining consistency in our investment approach. This strategy allows us to fully commit our resources from the start, which aligns with my preference for decisive, structured action over speculative or overly cautious moves. While I recognize the potential risks of full allocation, the even distribution mitigates some of that concern by avoiding overexposure in any single quarter. I’m open to other perspectives, but this option feels like the most logical starting point for our first year.</p><p>In this round, I’d like us to focus on assessing the current stable market conditions and sharing our initial impressions of the strengths and weaknesses of each budget allocation option. By collaboratively exploring these aspects, we can build a shared understanding of the environment we’re operating in and how each option aligns with potential opportunities and risks. I encourage each of you to share insights or perspectives I may not have fully considered, as integrating our diverse viewpoints will help us develop a more complete picture. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Clyde Vang</h4></p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I appreciate your perspective, Raja, on Option C and the emphasis on consistency in a stable market environment. I also lean toward Option C because I feel the even distribution of 100% of our funds across all quarters offers a steady path to growth without overcommitting in any single period, which aligns with my preference for sustainable progress. While I see the caution in Option A as valuable, I worry it might limit our potential too much, and I’m hesitant about the increasing allocations in Options B and D due to the lack of historical data to predict later-quarter risks.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for sharing your thoughts on Option C and highlighting the importance of a steady path to growth through even distribution. I appreciate your point about sustainable progress, as it reinforces the value of consistency in a stable market, which is a key reason I’m drawn to this option. Your concern about the lack of historical data for predicting risks in Options B and D also resonates with me, and I’d like to hear if others share similar hesitations about the increasing allocation strategies.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I’m glad to hear that my concern about the lack of historical data resonates with you, Raja. I think this uncertainty makes the even distribution of Option C even more appealing, as it avoids the potential pitfalls of escalating commitments in Options B and D when we can’t yet predict market shifts. I’d be curious to hear if others feel the same hesitation about increasing allocations without a clear foundation to guide us.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for reiterating the concern about the lack of historical data and how it underscores the strength of Option C’s even distribution approach. I agree that avoiding escalating commitments in Options B and D is prudent given the uncertainty in predicting market shifts, and this perspective strengthens my inclination toward Option C. I’m eager to hear from others if they share this hesitation or have different views on how the stable market conditions might influence our choice among the four options.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I’m pleased to see we’re aligned on the uncertainty surrounding market predictions, Raja, and how it supports the case for Option C’s balanced approach. This strategy feels like a responsible way to fully utilize our resources while minimizing risk in a stable market, and I think it reflects a commitment to sustainable growth. I’m looking forward to hearing if others agree or if they see different opportunities in the other options under these conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for emphasizing how Option C’s balanced approach supports sustainable growth and responsible resource use in this stable market. I share your view that it minimizes risk while maximizing our capital deployment, and I think this perspective adds important weight to our discussion. I’d like to open the floor now to hear from others—do you agree with this assessment of Option C, or do you see different strengths or risks in Options A, B, or D under these conditions?&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I’m grateful for this discussion, Raja, and I want to reaffirm my support for Option C as it balances risk and opportunity in a way that feels both responsible and forward-thinking in this stable market. I think it’s crucial we hear from others now to ensure we’ve considered all angles—whether it’s additional strengths of Option C or potential merits in Options A, B, or D that we might have overlooked. I’m open to refining my perspective based on any compelling insights shared.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for your continued support of Option C and for emphasizing the importance of hearing diverse perspectives to ensure we’ve explored all angles. I completely agree that balancing risk and opportunity responsibly is key in this stable market, and I appreciate your openness to refining views based on new insights. Let’s hear from the rest of the team now— I’m keen to know if others see additional strengths in Option C or have compelling points about Options A, B, or D that we should consider.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Remi Patrick</h4></p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I appreciate the points made about the balanced approach of Option C, Raja and Clyde, and I understand the appeal of minimizing risk through even distribution in a stable market. However, I’m drawn to Option D because it commits 100% of our funds with an increasing allocation across the quarters—10% in Q1 up to 40% in Q4—which I believe allows us to test the waters early on and capitalize on potential growth opportunities later in the year. I think this progressive strategy could maximize our returns if we identify high-growth assets in the later quarters, and I’m curious to hear if others see similar potential in taking a bolder approach under these stable conditions.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for bringing up the potential of Option D with its increasing allocation strategy to test the waters early and seize growth opportunities later in the year. I appreciate how you’ve highlighted the boldness of this approach in a stable market, as it offers a different way to maximize returns compared to the even distribution of Option C that I currently favor. I’m curious to hear from others—do you see similar potential in Option D’s progressive strategy, or do you have concerns about the risks of heavier commitments in later quarters?&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I’m glad we’re exploring the potential of Option D, Raja, and I understand the concern about the risks of heavier commitments in later quarters. However, I believe that in a stable market, this progressive allocation allows us to build confidence and insight from earlier investments, positioning us to make more informed and impactful decisions in Q3 and Q4. I’d love to hear if others think this staged approach could indeed mitigate some risks while still aiming for higher returns.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for elaborating on how Option D’s staged approach could help us build confidence and make more informed decisions in later quarters under stable market conditions. I find your point about mitigating risks through progressive learning particularly interesting, as it offers a strategic contrast to the immediate full commitment of Option C that I currently lean toward. I’d like to hear from others—do you agree with Remi’s view on the potential of Option D to balance risk and reward, or do you have different thoughts on how these options align with our current environment?&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I’m thrilled to see the discussion evolving, Raja, and I appreciate your recognition of Option D’s potential to balance risk and reward through progressive learning. I think this staged approach not only mitigates risk by starting smaller but also positions us to seize bigger opportunities later, which aligns well with maximizing returns in a stable market. I’m eager to hear if others see this as a viable way to blend caution with ambition, or if they feel Option C’s immediate commitment offers a stronger foundation.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for highlighting how Option D’s staged approach can blend caution with ambition, potentially positioning us to seize larger opportunities later in a stable market. I value your insight on mitigating risk by starting smaller, as it provides a thoughtful counterpoint to the immediate commitment of Option C that I currently favor. I’d like to hear from the rest of the team—do you see Option D as a strong way to balance risk and reward, or do you lean toward the consistency of Option C or other options under these conditions?&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I’m grateful for this opportunity to discuss further, Raja, and I appreciate your openness to exploring how Option D can balance risk and reward. I truly believe that starting with smaller allocations and ramping up allows us to adapt and optimize our strategy as we gain market insights throughout the year, which could be a significant advantage in a stable environment. While I see the strength in Option C’s consistent approach, I’d encourage the team to consider if Option D’s flexibility might better position us for unexpected opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for underscoring the flexibility of Option D and how starting with smaller allocations could help us adapt and optimize as we gain market insights throughout the year. I appreciate this perspective as it highlights a strategic advantage in a stable environment, offering a different lens compared to the consistent commitment of Option C that I currently lean toward. I’d like to open the floor to the rest of the team—do you see value in Option D’s adaptability for seizing unexpected opportunities, or do you prefer the stability of Option C or another approach among our predefined options?&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Dale Berry</h4></p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I’m grateful for the thoughtful insights shared so far, Raja, Clyde, and Remi, and I’m particularly aligned with the support for Option C due to its balanced and consistent approach in this stable market. As someone who values stability for our team, I believe allocating 100% of our funds evenly across all quarters ensures we maximize our opportunities without overextending in any single period, which feels like a responsible way to grow. While I appreciate Remi’s perspective on Option D’s flexibility, I’m concerned that increasing allocations later in the year could expose us to unforeseen risks, and I’d love to hear others’ thoughts on balancing caution with ambition in our first year.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for your support of Option C and for highlighting the importance of stability and responsible growth through even allocation across quarters. I share your concern about the potential unforeseen risks of increasing allocations later in the year as proposed in Option D, and I believe this reinforces the case for Option C’s consistent approach. I’m keen to hear from others—how do you view the balance between caution and ambition in our first year, and which of our predefined options do you think best achieves that balance?&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I appreciate your alignment with my concerns about the risks of increasing allocations in Option D, Raja, and I’m glad we share a focus on stability with Option C. While I understand the potential for flexibility that Remi highlighted with Option D, I feel that in our first year, establishing a consistent foundation with Option C is crucial to building trust and minimizing surprises. I’m eager to hear from others on how they weigh the need for caution against the desire for ambition in this stable market.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for reiterating the value of stability and building trust through Option C’s consistent approach, especially in our first year. I agree that minimizing surprises is critical at this stage, and your perspective strengthens my view that Option C offers a solid foundation compared to the flexibility of Option D. I’d like to hear from the rest of the team—how do you weigh the importance of caution versus ambition in this stable market, and which of our predefined options do you believe best supports our goals?&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for recognizing the strength of Option C in providing a solid foundation through consistency, which I believe is essential as we establish ourselves. While I see the potential for ambition in Option D as Remi described, I remain concerned about the unpredictability it introduces, and I think Option C better aligns with our need for caution in a stable market during this initial phase. I’m looking forward to hearing how others balance these priorities and which option they feel best supports our long-term goals.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for emphasizing the importance of caution and consistency with Option C, especially as we establish ourselves in this stable market. I share your concern about the unpredictability that Option D might introduce, and I believe your focus on long-term goals strengthens the case for Option C as a prudent choice. I’d like to hear from the rest of the team—how do you balance caution and ambition, and which of our predefined options do you think best aligns with our objectives for Year 1?&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for acknowledging the need for caution with Option C, which I firmly believe is the best path for us in this stable market as we build our foundation in Year 1. While I’ve appreciated hearing the ambitious aspects of Option D and the cautious elements of Options A and B, I remain convinced that Option C’s even distribution offers the stability we need to grow responsibly, and I hope we can unite around this approach. I’m grateful for everyone’s insights and look forward to seeing how we collectively decide to move forward.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for your steadfast support of Option C and for highlighting how its even distribution provides the stability we need to grow responsibly in this stable market. I value your call for unity around this approach, as it aligns with my belief that consistency is key for building a strong foundation in Year 1. I’d like to hear from the remaining team members—do you share Dale’s view on Option C, or do you see different strengths in Options A, B, or D that we should consider under these market conditions?&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 1 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody summarized: &quot;Raja Moody **Round 1 Summary by CEO Raja Moody**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Round Theme and Objective**: I want to thank everyone for a productive first round of discussion focused on the theme of &#x27;Assessment of current market conditions and initial impressions of budget allocation options.&#x27; Our objective was to develop a shared understanding of the stable market environment and gather initial shareholder perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of each option.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**: I’ve noted a range of perspectives from our group. I, along with Clyde Vang, Dale Berry, and Eleri Kirk, expressed strong support for Option C, emphasizing its balanced and consistent approach to allocating 100% of our funds evenly across quarters. On the other hand, Remi Patrick and Hallie Donnelly advocated for Option D, highlighting the potential of its progressive allocation strategy—starting at 10% in Q1 and increasing to 40% in Q4—to balance caution with ambition and capitalize on later growth opportunities. Options A and B received less attention, with some cautious acknowledgment but no strong support.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Specific Arguments and Evidence Presented**: For Option C, key arguments included its even distribution providing consistency, maximizing capital utilization while mitigating risk, supporting sustainable growth, and building a solid foundation in our first year by minimizing surprises, especially given the lack of historical data. For Option D, supporters pointed to the benefits of testing the waters early with smaller investments, building confidence and insight over time, offering flexibility to adapt, and potentially maximizing returns by scaling up in later quarters during a stable market.</p><p>4. **Identification of Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**: We have consensus on the stable nature of the current market, which provides a favorable environment for investment. However, there is clear disagreement on the best allocation strategy, with a majority leaning toward Option C for its stability and consistency, while a notable minority supports Option D for its adaptability and potential for higher returns through progressive scaling. The risks associated with increasing allocations in later quarters under Option D remain a point of concern for several of us.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**: I believe we’ve made significant progress in building a shared understanding of the stable market conditions and articulating initial impressions of our budget allocation options. Each perspective has contributed to a fuller picture of the potential risks and opportunities, helping us lay the groundwork for deeper analysis in subsequent rounds.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**: As a reminder, we must choose only from our predefined options: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, and &#x27;Option D&#x27;. I’m pleased that our discussion has remained focused on these choices, and I encourage us to continue evaluating them exclusively as we move forward.</p><p>7. **Indication of Next Steps or Issues to Address**: In the next round, I’d like us to shift our focus to a detailed analysis of risk and opportunity in full versus partial allocation strategies. We’ll explore the trade-offs between maximizing capital deployment with Options C and D versus maintaining flexibility with partial allocations in Options A and B. I look forward to diving deeper into these considerations and building on the valuable insights shared today.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 1 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly, I argued strongly in favor of Option D, emphasizing that committing 100% of funds with an increasing allocation across the quarters allows for building momentum and adapting strategy based on early insights, which I believe maximizes returns in a stable market. I highlighted that this progressive approach balances caution with ambition by starting smaller in Q1 and scaling up, offering flexibility to test the waters and capitalize on later growth opportunities. CEO Raja Moody acknowledged my points as a thoughtful alternative to his preference for the consistent commitment of Option C and invited further discussion on the strategic advantages of adaptability versus stability. Throughout our exchange, we agreed on the stable market context but disagreed on the preferred allocation strategy, with the CEO leaning toward Option C’s consistency while I advocated for Option D’s progressive scaling to optimize returns.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 1, Clyde Vang, Dale Berry, and Eleri Kirk strongly supported Option C, emphasizing its balanced, consistent allocation of 100% of funds evenly across quarters as a prudent strategy in a stable market. They argued this approach maximizes capital utilization while minimizing risk and providing a solid foundation amid uncertainty due to lack of historical data. Remi Patrick advocated for Option D, highlighting its progressive allocation as a way to test early investments and capitalize on growth opportunities later, balancing caution with ambition. Notable agreement existed on the stable market environment, but disagreement centered on risk tolerance—most favored the stability of Option C, while a minority valued Option D’s adaptability and potential for higher returns through scaling investments over time. Options A and B received minimal support, viewed as either too cautious or less optimal given current conditions.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

CEO Raja Moody favors Option C, advocating for full allocation evenly distributed across quarters to maximize capital utilization while maintaining consistency and mitigating risk. He emphasizes a practical, analytical approach suited to the stable market environment and prefers decisive, structured action over speculative or overly cautious moves. Throughout the discussion, he acknowledges the concerns about risks in Options B and D due to lack of historical data but remains inclined toward Option C’s stability. While open to other perspectives, including the strategic adaptability of Option D presented by some shareholders, his position does not notably shift, maintaining a preference for consistency as the best foundation for Year 1.</p><p><br>
<h2>My Position Reassessment After Round 1</h2></p><p>Hallie Donnelly UPDATED CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:<br>
- Option A: 8%<br>
- Option B: 12%<br>
- Option C: 20%<br>
- Option D: 60%<br>
KEY INFLUENCING ARGUMENTS: Remi Patrick’s support for Option D reinforced my belief in its progressive allocation strategy, particularly the idea of testing the waters early and capitalizing on growth later. The CEO’s acknowledgment of Option D’s adaptability as a strategic alternative to Option C’s consistency made me more confident in its potential. However, concerns from Clyde Vang, Dale Berry, and Eleri Kirk about the unpredictability and risks of increasing allocations in later quarters under Option D prompted me to slightly temper my enthusiasm and consider their caution.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This discussion has deepened my understanding of the trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Initially, I was heavily focused on the growth potential of Option D, but hearing the majority’s emphasis on risk mitigation with Option C has made me more aware of potential pitfalls in my approach. While I still believe in the strategic advantage of progressive scaling, I now recognize the value of consistency as a foundation, which has slightly adjusted my confidence distribution to reflect a more balanced perspective.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option D<br>
REASONING: I remain committed to Option D because its progressive allocation strategy aligns with my vision for balancing caution with ambition, allowing us to adapt based on early insights in a stable market. The support from Remi Patrick and the CEO’s recognition of its strategic potential further bolster my confidence. While I acknowledge the valid concerns about risks in later quarters, I believe starting with smaller investments provides a safety net to mitigate those risks. I see Option D as the best way to optimize returns while maintaining flexibility.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 1 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody decided to continue the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we have made significant progress in understanding the stable market conditions and gathering initial impressions of the budget allocation options. However, there are still critical aspects that need deeper exploration, particularly the detailed risk-reward trade-offs between full allocation strategies in Options C and D versus the flexibility offered by partial allocations in Options A and B. Continuing the discussion will allow us to address unresolved concerns, such as the risks of escalating commitments in later quarters under Option D and the potential missed opportunities with partial allocations. This additional round will help us build a stronger consensus and ensure that our final decision is well-informed and balanced, reflecting the collective wisdom of the group.</p><p></p><p><h2>Round 2 - Discussion</h2></p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Theme</h2></p><p>For this round, CEO Raja Moody has set the theme: &#x27;Analysis of risk and opportunity in full versus partial allocation strategies | Expected outcome: Identify the trade-offs between maximizing capital deployment (Options C and D) and maintaining flexibility with partial allocation (Options A and B)&#x27;</p><p><br>
<h3>Round 2 Introduction</h3></p><p>CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Raja Moody Welcome, everyone, to Round 2 of our annual budget meeting for Year 1. My current thinking is that Option C appears most promising because, after reflecting on the discussion, I still believe Option C offers the best balance of risk and opportunity through its even distribution of 100% of our funds across quarters. The majority support from shareholders reinforces my view that consistency and stability are crucial in our first year, especially without historical data to guide us. While Option D’s adaptability is intriguing, the potential risks of escalating commitments in later quarters remain a concern for me, though I&#x27;m interested in exploring all perspectives to refine our understanding. </p><p>This round’s theme is the &#x27;Analysis of risk and opportunity in full versus partial allocation strategies,&#x27; where our expected outcome is to identify the trade-offs between maximizing capital deployment with Options C and D and maintaining flexibility with partial allocations in Options A and B. I believe this discussion will help us synthesize diverse perspectives to gain a deeper understanding of how each strategy aligns with our goals in a stable market, and I encourage everyone to share insights on the potential impacts of timing and flexibility on our returns. IMPORTANT: I want to remind everyone that we must choose from our predefined options only: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, &#x27;Option D&#x27;. Please keep all discussion focused on evaluating these specific options, and I invite you to contribute any perspectives that might enhance our collective understanding, especially on aspects of risk or opportunity I may not have fully considered.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h3>Discussion</h3></p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Eleri Kirk</h4></p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I appreciate the focus on analyzing risk and opportunity in full versus partial allocation strategies, and I continue to support Option C for its full, even distribution across quarters, as it maximizes our capital deployment while maintaining stability in this stable market. In my view, partial allocations like Options A and B, while offering flexibility, risk missing out on potential returns by holding back significant funds, which could hinder our growth momentum in our first year. I’m curious to hear more from those supporting Options A or B on how they see the trade-off between flexibility and the opportunity cost of uninvested capital.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri, for highlighting the opportunity cost of uninvested capital with partial allocations like Options A and B, which is a critical point in evaluating the trade-offs of flexibility versus growth momentum. I share your view that Option C’s full, even distribution offers a strong balance of stability and capital deployment in this stable market. I’d also like to hear from those considering Options A or B on how they weigh the benefits of flexibility against the potential missed returns Eleri mentioned.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligned on the strengths of Option C, Raja, and I appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into these trade-offs. I’d like to emphasize that in a stable market, the risk of holding back capital with Options A and B could set us back in establishing a strong foundation, and I believe committing fully with Option C aligns with responsible growth. I’m eager to hear from others on whether they see specific scenarios where the flexibility of partial allocations might outweigh these missed opportunities.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri, for reiterating the importance of establishing a strong foundation through full commitment with Option C, especially in a stable market where missed opportunities could hinder our growth. I agree that holding back capital with Options A and B poses a significant risk to our momentum, and I’m keen to explore this further. I’d like to hear from others if there are particular scenarios or market shifts they foresee where the flexibility of partial allocations might provide a strategic edge over full deployment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I appreciate the opportunity to explore this further, Raja, and while I remain committed to Option C for its balance and full capital deployment, I can see a scenario where partial allocations in Options A or B might offer an edge if unexpected market volatility arises mid-year, allowing us to pivot or preserve capital. However, given the current stable market conditions, I believe the risk of missed growth opportunities outweighs this potential benefit, and I’d prioritize establishing momentum with Option C. I’m very interested to hear if others have specific examples or conditions where they think flexibility could prove more strategic.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri, for bringing up the potential advantage of partial allocations in Options A and B during unexpected market volatility, as it’s an important consideration in weighing flexibility against growth momentum. While I agree that the stable market conditions currently favor Option C’s full deployment to establish momentum, your point about pivoting mid-year is worth exploring further. I’d like to invite others to share any specific examples or conditions where they believe flexibility might outweigh the benefits of full capital commitment.&quot;</p><p><br>
Eleri Kirk: &quot;I’m grateful for the chance to delve deeper into this, Raja, and I appreciate your recognition of the potential need to pivot mid-year with partial allocations like Options A and B in case of volatility. However, given the current stable market, I still strongly believe that Option C’s full and even deployment offers the best path to build momentum and establish a solid foundation for our first year. I look forward to hearing from others about specific scenarios where they think flexibility might take precedence over the benefits of full commitment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Eleri, for again highlighting the potential value of flexibility in Options A and B should volatility arise, while maintaining your support for Option C’s full deployment in the current stable market. I agree that building momentum with Option C seems most prudent given the conditions, but I’m intrigued by the idea of pivoting if needed and would like to hear from others on specific scenarios where flexibility might indeed take precedence over full commitment. Let’s keep this discussion moving forward by inviting fresh perspectives on these trade-offs.&quot;</p><p><br>
---</p><p><br>
<h4>Exchange with Dale Berry</h4></p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I continue to support Option C for its full, even allocation of 100% of our funds across quarters, as it maximizes our capital deployment while providing the stability we need in our first year to build a strong foundation. I share Eleri’s concern about the opportunity cost of holding back capital with Options A and B, as this could limit our growth potential in a stable market where consistent investment could yield steady returns. However, I’m open to hearing from others about specific scenarios where the flexibility of partial allocations might offer a strategic advantage, especially if unexpected changes occur.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for emphasizing the importance of maximizing capital deployment with Option C’s even allocation and for highlighting the opportunity cost of holding back funds with Options A and B in a stable market. I agree that consistent investment is key to building a strong foundation in our first year, and I’m glad to see this perspective shared. I’d like to hear from others about any specific scenarios where the flexibility of partial allocations might provide a strategic advantage, especially in the face of unexpected changes as you mentioned.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I’m glad we’re aligned on the importance of a strong foundation with Option C, Raja, and I appreciate the focus on exploring flexibility in this round. While I remain committed to Option C for its consistent full allocation in a stable market, I can see a potential advantage in Options A or B if an unforeseen market downturn occurs, allowing us to hold back capital for more opportune moments. I’d be very interested to hear from others if they can pinpoint specific conditions or triggers that might make such flexibility a stronger strategic choice over full deployment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for pointing out the potential strategic advantage of partial allocations in Options A and B during an unforeseen market downturn, as it adds an important dimension to our analysis of flexibility versus full deployment. I remain supportive of Option C for its consistency and stability in the current stable market, but I’m keen to explore this further and would like to hear from others about specific conditions or triggers that might make flexibility a more compelling choice over full allocation. Let’s keep building on these insights to ensure we’re considering all possible scenarios.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I appreciate your openness to exploring specific scenarios, Raja, and while I still strongly support Option C for its stability and full commitment in a stable market, I think it’s worth considering that a sudden regulatory change or unexpected economic shift could make the flexibility of Options A or B more appealing to preserve capital. I’d like to hear from others if they can identify particular market signals or events that might trigger a need for such caution over the momentum we’d gain with Option C. This could help us better prepare for uncertainties even as we prioritize growth.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for raising the possibility of sudden regulatory changes or economic shifts as scenarios where the flexibility of Options A and B could be advantageous in preserving capital. I agree that while Option C offers stability and momentum in the current stable market, it’s critical to consider how we might respond to such uncertainties, and your point helps sharpen our focus on preparedness. I’d like to hear from others about any particular market signals or events they believe could justify prioritizing flexibility over full commitment, as this will help us build a more robust strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Dale Berry: &quot;I’m thankful, Raja, for highlighting the need to prepare for uncertainties, and I still believe Option C provides the best path for stability and growth in our current stable market by fully committing our capital evenly across quarters. However, I recognize that specific events like sudden geopolitical tensions or unexpected inflation spikes could make the flexibility of Options A or B a safer choice to protect our funds, and I’d value hearing others’ thoughts on these or other potential triggers. This perspective could help us balance our drive for momentum with a readiness to adapt if the market shifts unexpectedly.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Dale, for identifying specific triggers like geopolitical tensions or unexpected inflation spikes that could make the flexibility of Options A and B a safer choice, as this adds a crucial dimension to our risk analysis. While I still favor Option C for its stability and full commitment in the current stable market, I appreciate your focus on preparedness and would like to hear from others about additional potential triggers or scenarios that might shift the balance toward flexibility over momentum. Let’s continue to build on these insights to ensure we’re considering all angles of this trade-off.&quot;</p><p><br>

Hallie Donnelly: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for inviting further exploration of scenarios where Option D’s adaptability might outperform. I envision a situation in a stable market where early quarters reveal a sector-specific growth trend, such as a surge in tech stocks; Option D allows us to strategically allocate more funds in Q3 and Q4 to capitalize on this with data-driven confidence. While I appreciate the consistent stability of Option C, I believe Option D’s flexibility to scale up based on real-time insights could position us for superior returns in such scenarios.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Hallie, for providing a concrete scenario where Option D’s progressive allocation could enable us to capitalize on a sector-specific growth trend like a surge in tech stocks, using real-time insights to maximize returns in later quarters. While I still favor Option C for its consistent stability in this stable market, your example highlights a compelling advantage of adaptability, and I’d like to hear from others on whether they see similar opportunities or risks in prioritizing such flexibility over an even distribution. Let’s continue to build on these perspectives to ensure we’re fully exploring the trade-offs as we move toward a decision.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Clyde Vang</h4></p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;I appreciate the thoughtful points raised by Eleri, Dale, and Hallie on the trade-offs between full and partial allocations. I continue to support Option C for its full, even distribution of 100% of our funds, as it provides the stability and momentum we need in a stable market to build a strong foundation, especially without historical data to guide us. However, I recognize Hallie’s point about adaptability in Option D, and while I’m cautious about escalating commitments later in the year, I’m open to considering how partial allocations in Options A or B might offer a safety net if unexpected market shifts occur, though I believe the opportunity cost of holding back capital currently outweighs that benefit.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for articulating the balance between the stability and momentum of Option C and recognizing the adaptability offered by Option D, as well as the potential safety net of partial allocations in Options A and B. While I share your preference for Option C’s consistent full distribution in this stable market, I appreciate your openness to considering flexibility as a response to unexpected shifts, and I’d like to hear from others on how they weigh the opportunity cost of holding back capital against the potential benefits of a safety net. Let’s keep exploring these trade-offs to ensure we’re making the most informed decision possible.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for acknowledging the importance of weighing opportunity costs against flexibility. I’d like to emphasize that while I see the potential safety net of partial allocations in Options A and B as a valid consideration for unexpected shifts, I still believe that in our current stable market, Option C’s full and even distribution offers the best chance to establish momentum and build a lasting foundation for future growth. I’m curious to hear from others if they envision specific, tangible triggers that might make the flexibility of partial allocations more advantageous than the consistent commitment of Option C.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for highlighting the potential safety net of partial allocations in Options A and B while reinforcing the strength of Option C’s full and even distribution in establishing momentum in a stable market. I share your view that Option C provides a solid foundation for growth, but I’m intrigued by your call for specific triggers that might justify flexibility, and I’d like to invite others to share any concrete scenarios or market conditions where partial allocations could prove more strategic. Let’s continue to build on these insights to thoroughly evaluate the trade-offs before us.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for encouraging us to explore concrete scenarios where flexibility might be strategic. While I remain committed to Option C for its consistent full allocation and the momentum it builds in a stable market, I can envision a scenario where a sudden economic policy change or unexpected market disruption might make the partial allocations of Options A or B a safer choice to preserve capital. I’m eager to hear from others if they can identify additional specific conditions or events that might tip the balance toward flexibility over the steady growth approach of Option C.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for identifying specific scenarios such as sudden economic policy changes or market disruptions where the flexibility of partial allocations in Options A and B could serve as a safeguard to preserve capital. While I continue to support Option C for its consistent full allocation and ability to build momentum in a stable market, I value your perspective on preparedness for unexpected events, and I’d like to hear from others about any additional conditions or events that might shift the balance toward flexibility over steady growth. Let’s keep this dialogue open to ensure we’re considering all possible angles as we refine our strategy.&quot;</p><p><br>
Clyde Vang: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for valuing the perspective on preparedness and keeping the dialogue open to explore all angles. While I still strongly support Option C for its consistent full allocation and the steady momentum it offers in our current stable market, I think it’s crucial to acknowledge that specific events like a sudden financial crisis or regulatory upheaval could highlight the protective benefits of partial allocations in Options A and B. I’m keen to hear from others about any further scenarios or market indicators they believe could justify prioritizing flexibility over the steady growth path we’d pursue with Option C.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Clyde, for pointing out specific events like a sudden financial crisis or regulatory upheaval that could underscore the protective benefits of partial allocations in Options A and B. While I remain supportive of Option C for its consistent full allocation and steady momentum in our current stable market, I appreciate your focus on preparedness for such scenarios, and I’d like to invite others to share any additional market indicators or situations where flexibility might take precedence over steady growth. Let’s continue to explore these possibilities to ensure we’re fully prepared for any unexpected challenges.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h4>Exchange with Remi Patrick</h4></p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;I’m thrilled to dive into this analysis of risk and opportunity, and I continue to support Option D for its full allocation with a progressive increase, as it allows us to start cautiously, learn from early quarters, and scale up investments in Q3 and Q4 to capture growth in this stable market. I appreciate Hallie’s point about leveraging early insights for later gains, and while I understand the appeal of Option C’s stability as highlighted by Eleri, Dale, and Clyde, I believe Option D offers a strategic edge by combining full commitment with adaptability, mitigating some risk through staged investments. I’m also wary of the opportunity cost of partial allocations in Options A and B, as holding back capital could limit our momentum, so I’d like to hear if others see specific scenarios where that flexibility might outweigh the benefits of full deployment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for advocating for Option D and highlighting its progressive allocation as a way to balance caution with growth by learning from early quarters and scaling up later in a stable market. While I still lean toward Option C for its consistent stability, I value your perspective on combining full commitment with adaptability, and I’m interested in exploring how this approach might mitigate risks in specific scenarios. I’d also like to hear from others on whether they see particular situations where the flexibility of partial allocations in Options A and B might outweigh the benefits of full deployment as you’ve questioned.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for considering the potential of Option D’s adaptability to mitigate risks, and I’d like to highlight a specific scenario where early quarters reveal a growing trend in a high-return sector—Option D allows us to ramp up investments in Q3 and Q4 to capitalize on this with informed confidence. While I respect the stability of Option C, I think Option D’s staged approach offers a unique advantage in dynamically responding to such opportunities in a stable market. Regarding Options A and B, I remain concerned about missing growth by holding back capital, but I’m open to hearing if others can pinpoint concrete situations where that flexibility might prove more strategic.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for providing a concrete example of how Option D’s progressive allocation could enable us to capitalize on a growing trend in a high-return sector by scaling up investments in later quarters with informed confidence. While I still favor Option C for its consistent stability in this stable market, your scenario underscores the potential strategic advantage of adaptability, and I’d like to hear from others on whether they see similar opportunities where Option D’s staged approach might outperform an even distribution. Let’s also explore if anyone can identify specific situations where the flexibility of Options A and B might offer a strategic edge over full deployment, as you’ve raised a valid concern about missing growth by holding back capital.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for acknowledging the strategic potential of Option D’s staged approach, and I’d like to build on that by noting that in a stable market, if we identify an emerging opportunity early on, such as a spike in real estate demand, Option D empowers us to allocate more heavily in later quarters with data-backed confidence. While I still see Option C’s stability as a strong point, I believe Option D’s ability to adapt offers a competitive edge in maximizing returns. On Options A and B, I’m curious if others can highlight specific market disruptions where holding back capital might protect us, as I’m open to understanding when flexibility could outweigh the growth potential of full deployment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for illustrating how Option D’s progressive allocation could allow us to capitalize on an emerging opportunity like a spike in real estate demand by scaling up investments in later quarters with data-backed confidence. While I continue to support Option C for its consistent stability in this stable market, I appreciate your emphasis on adaptability as a competitive edge, and I’d like to hear from others on whether they see similar scenarios where Option D’s flexibility might lead to higher returns. Additionally, I invite input on specific market disruptions where the partial allocations of Options A and B might offer protection, as you’ve raised an important point about balancing flexibility with growth potential.&quot;</p><p><br>
Remi Patrick: &quot;Thank you, Raja, for recognizing the competitive edge of adaptability in Option D, and I’d like to emphasize that in a stable market, if we spot a trend like a tech innovation boom early in the year, Option D allows us to strategically increase allocations in later quarters to maximize gains with confidence. While I value Option C’s consistent approach, I believe Option D’s flexibility positions us to outperform if we leverage such opportunities effectively. Regarding Options A and B, I can see their partial allocations being protective in a sudden market downturn, like an unexpected recession, and I’m eager to hear if others can identify additional disruptions where this flexibility might be critical over full deployment.&quot;</p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody: &quot;Thank you, Remi, for providing a specific scenario where Option D’s progressive allocation could help us capitalize on a trend like a tech innovation boom by increasing investments in later quarters with confidence. While I still favor Option C for its consistent stability in this stable market, I appreciate your insight on adaptability as a potential outperforming factor, and I’d like to hear from others on whether they see similar opportunities where Option D might excel over an even distribution. Additionally, I invite input on specific disruptions, beyond an unexpected recession, where the partial allocations of Options A and B might offer critical protection, ensuring we fully explore all trade-offs.&quot;</p><p><br>

<h3>Round 2 Summary</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody summarized: &quot;Raja Moody **Round 2 Summary by CEO Raja Moody**</p><p>1. **Restatement of Round Theme and Objective**: I want to express my gratitude to everyone for a thorough and insightful second round of discussion focused on the theme of &#x27;Analysis of risk and opportunity in full versus partial allocation strategies.&#x27; Our objective was to identify the trade-offs between maximizing capital deployment with Options C and D and maintaining flexibility with partial allocations in Options A and B.</p><p>2. **Summary of Key Viewpoints Expressed by Shareholders**: I’ve observed a diversity of perspectives from our group. I, along with Eleri Kirk, Dale Berry, and Clyde Vang, continue to support Option C for its full, even allocation of 100% of our funds, emphasizing stability and momentum in a stable market. Conversely, Hallie Donnelly and Remi Patrick advocate for Option D, highlighting its progressive allocation strategy that balances risk with adaptability by scaling up investments based on early insights. While Options A and B received less direct support, several shareholders, including Dale Berry, Clyde Vang, and Remi Patrick, acknowledged their potential as a safety net in specific scenarios of market disruption.</p><p>3. **Highlight of Specific Arguments and Evidence Presented**: For Option C, key arguments included maximizing capital deployment for consistent growth, avoiding the opportunity cost of uninvested funds, and building a strong foundation in our first year under stable market conditions. For Option D, supporters emphasized its ability to start cautiously, learn from early quarters, and scale up later to capitalize on trends such as tech innovation booms or real estate demand spikes, potentially outperforming Option C by dynamically responding to market nuances. For Options A and B, arguments focused on their flexibility as a protective measure against unforeseen events like sudden downturns, regulatory changes, financial crises, or geopolitical tensions, though concerns about missed growth opportunities in a stable market were widely noted.</p><p>4. **Identification of Areas of Consensus and Disagreement**: We have consensus on the importance of capital deployment in a stable market to drive growth, as well as a shared recognition that flexibility could be valuable under specific adverse conditions. However, there remains disagreement on the optimal strategy, with a majority favoring Option C for its stability and consistent momentum, while a minority supports Option D for its adaptability and potential for higher returns through staged investments. The value of partial allocations in Options A and B is still debated, with opportunity cost concerns outweighing flexibility benefits for most of us at this stage.</p><p>5. **Assessment of Progress Toward Addressing the Theme**: I believe we’ve made substantial progress in dissecting the trade-offs between full and partial allocation strategies. The discussion has illuminated the strengths of full deployment for growth and stability under current conditions, while also highlighting adaptability and safety nets as critical considerations in specific scenarios. Each perspective has enriched our understanding of risk and opportunity, setting a strong foundation for final consensus-building in the next round.</p><p>6. **Reiteration of Valid Options**: As a reminder, we must choose only from our predefined options: &#x27;Option A&#x27;, &#x27;Option B&#x27;, &#x27;Option C&#x27;, and &#x27;Option D&#x27;. I’m pleased that our discussion has stayed focused on these choices, and I encourage us to continue evaluating them exclusively as we move forward.</p><p>7. **Indication of Next Steps or Issues to Address**: In the next round, I’d like us to focus on consensus-building on the optimal budget allocation strategy for Year 1. We’ll address any lingering concerns or uncertainties about the top options, particularly the risks of escalating commitments in Option D versus the consistent stability of Option C, and finalize our agreement on the best approach for the company’s goals. I look forward to synthesizing these insights and moving toward a unified decision.&quot;</p><p><br>
<h2>Round 2 Discussion Summary</h2></p><p><h3>My Dialogue with CEO</h3><br>
As Hallie Donnelly in Round 2, I reiterated my strong support for Option D, emphasizing its full capital deployment with a progressive allocation that starts cautiously and scales up throughout the year. I argued that this approach balances risk with opportunity by allowing adaptation based on early market feedback, enabling the company to capitalize on emerging trends in a stable market. CEO Raja Moody acknowledged my points as a strategic alternative to his preference for Option C’s consistent full allocation, expressing interest in exploring specific scenarios where Option D’s adaptability might offer advantages. While we agreed on the importance of managing risk and maximizing returns, we maintained differing views on the preferred allocation strategy, with the CEO favoring stability and me advocating for flexibility and momentum through progressive scaling.</p><p><h3>Other Shareholders&#x27; Contributions</h3><br>
During Round 2, Clyde Vang, Dale Berry, and Eleri Kirk consistently supported Option C, emphasizing its full, even allocation of funds as the best strategy for stability and momentum in a stable market. They argued that partial allocations (Options A and B) risk missing growth opportunities by holding back capital, though they acknowledged these options might serve as a safety net in cases of unexpected market volatility or disruptions such as regulatory changes or economic shifts. Remi Patrick advocated for Option D, highlighting its progressive allocation as a way to balance caution with adaptability, allowing the company to scale investments based on early market insights and capitalize on emerging trends. Notable agreement existed on the importance of maximizing capital deployment in a stable market, but disagreement remained over the trade-off between the consistent momentum of Option C and the flexibility and potential higher returns offered by Option D’s staged approach.</p><p><h3>Analysis of Shareholder Positions</h3><br>

However, the majority support for Option C by Clyde Vang, Dale Berry, and Eleri Kirk, with their emphasis on stability and the opportunity cost of uninvested capital in Options A and B, made me slightly more considerate of Option C’s merits, though not enough to shift my primary position.<br>
METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION: This round has deepened my appreciation for the nuanced balance between adaptability and stability in investment strategies. Initially, I was predominantly focused on the growth potential and flexibility of Option D, but the repeated emphasis on stability and consistent momentum by the majority has prompted me to critically evaluate the risks of escalating commitments in later quarters. While I remain steadfast in my support for Option D, I now recognize the importance of having robust mechanisms to gather and act on early market feedback to mitigate those risks, which has refined my perspective on how to implement this strategy effectively.<br>
PREFERRED OPTION: Option D<br>
REASONING: I continue to support Option D because its progressive allocation strategy aligns with my strategic vision of balancing caution with ambition, allowing us to adapt based on early market insights in a stable environment. The support from Remi Patrick and the CEO’s recognition of its potential to dynamically respond to trends reinforce my belief in its superiority for maximizing returns. While I respect the stability offered by Option C, I believe Option D’s structure provides a unique advantage by enabling us to scale investments strategically, potentially outperforming an even distribution if we leverage real-time data effectively.<br>
POSITION CHANGED: No</p><p><br>
<h3>End Round 2 Decision</h3></p><p><br>
CEO Raja Moody decided to end the discussion.<br>
Reason: I believe we have thoroughly explored the key aspects of risk and opportunity in full versus partial allocation strategies through two comprehensive rounds of discussion. The majority support for Option C, emphasizing stability and momentum in a stable market, aligns with my analytical assessment as the most prudent choice for our first year.

While I appreciate the stability Option C offers, I feel it lacks the adaptability needed to capitalize on emerging opportunities.<br>
- Dale Berry: Approve - I fully support the proposal for Option C as it aligns with my belief in establishing a stable and balanced foundation for our company in this first year. The even allocation of 100% of our funds across all quarters ensures we maximize growth while minimizing risk in a stable market, which resonates with my commitment to protecting our collective interests. I appreciate the thorough discussions and believe this approach offers the consistency and predictability we need to build long-term success.<br>
- Raja Moody: Approve - After thorough deliberation and considering the diverse perspectives shared during our discussions, I remain convinced that Option C is the optimal choice for our company in this stable market environment. Its even allocation of 100% of our funds across all quarters aligns with my analytical approach and leadership vision, prioritizing stability and momentum in our first year. I believe this proposal effectively balances the majority shareholder support with my judgment, and I am prepared to advocate for it as the best path forward for sustainable growth.</p><p><br>
